"Greg Gianforte was accused of attacking a journalist from the UK's Guardian newspaper a day before his election.
The congressman said he was making a $50,000 (Â£38,000) donation to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).
The Guardian said the apology and donation was ""part of an agreement that settles any potential civil claims"".
A letter sent by Mr Gianforte to journalist Ben Jacobs offered a ""sincere apology"".
""My physical response to your legitimate question was unprofessional, unacceptable and unlawful,"" it said.
Mr Gianforte, who won the election, is still facing a criminal charge of misdemeanour assault, for which the maximum penalty is a $500 fine and a six-month jail term.
He ""grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground"" after the reporter persisted in trying to question him about healthcare policy, another reporter from Fox News, who witnessed the confrontation, said.
""I watched in disbelief as Gianforte then began punching the reporter. As Gianforte moved on top of Jacobs, he began yelling something to the effect of, 'I'm sick and tired of this!'"" Alicia Acuna said.
Mr Jacob's glasses were broken during the incident.
Mr Gianforte initially claimed Mr Jacobs had grabbed his wrist, pulling them both to the ground. His spokesperson called it ""aggressive behaviour from a liberal journalist"".
But in his formal apology to Mr Jacobs on Wednesday, he said: ""Notwithstanding anyone's statements to the contrary, you did not initiate any physical contact with me, and I had no right to assault you. I am sorry for what I did and the unwanted notoriety this has created for you.
""I take full responsibility,"" he added.
The apology also detailed the donation to the CPJ, ""in the hope that perhaps some good can come of these events"".
The CPJ is an independent non-profit group that promotes press freedom globally.
In a tweet, the group said it had accepted the donation for what it called Mr Gianforte's ""unacceptable behaviour toward a journalist just doing his job"".
In the Guardian, Mr Jacobs said he had accepted the apology.
The newspaper had previously covered Mr Jacob's acquisition of a new pair of glasses from a London optician - noting that he donated the pair broken in the clash to Washington DC's press museum, the Newseum.",A Montana politician charged with assaulting a reporter has apologised and made a substantial donation to a press freedom charity.,40199559
"The banner which read ""supporting the London Olympics"" breached the rules set out by Games organisers Locog.
The rules state that only official sponsors are allowed to use logos and text defined in the organisation's  
          2012 UK statutory marketing rights.
The sign was being used to promote Olympic events in the city.
The torch relay is due to visit Derby on 29 June and Peter Allen, director of marketing for the university, said he was keen to support the event.
He said: ""As you can imagine it's difficult to do this without making reference in some way to the Olympics.""
But he added that the university was working closely with Locog and the city council to ensure it followed brand guidelines.
Several independent businesses in the East Midlands have also used Olympic logos in their shop windows.
Hobsons shoe shop on the Strand in Derby has put a display with five coloured rings in its window.
The shop's owner said he would keep the rings until he was told to take them down.
The owner of a neighbouring wool shop, John Sallis, had planned to create his own woollen Olympic rings to put on display.
He said: ""It's absolutely ridiculous - all I want to do is celebrate the Olympics by putting the five rings in the window to celebrate the Olympic runners coming past.""
One shop owner in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, was told to take down her plastic rings by Trading Standards.
Julie Swain, who runs a lingerie shop, said: ""We were hoping to have a competition for window designs for when the torch relay comes past. Obviously, I don't think we will be able to do that now.""
Keith Regan, from Leicestershire Trading Standards, said: ""The Olympic rings are very much protected.""
He added that people could get involved by using different types of displays  - as long as Olympic logos were not used.",The University of Derby has removed a sign supporting the London 2012 Olympics because it had not been officially approved.,17833838
"Stephen O'Brien urged the warring parties to allow the evacuation of hundreds of people who need urgent medical care.
Rebel-held front-line areas were subject to dozens of Russian air strikes overnight, observers said.
It allowed government troops to gain ground in the north of the city.
Hours later, the Syrian army offered rebel fighters safe passage if they evacuated eastern Aleppo.
""The army high command calls all armed fighters in the eastern neighbourhood of Aleppo to leave these neighbourhoods and let civilian residents live their normal lives,"" said a statement, carried by state news agency Sana on Sunday.
""The Russian and Syrian military leaderships will guarantee safe passage for the fighters and will give them aid as necessary.""
The government made a similar offer in July, but the rebels ignored it.
Syrian government forces have been trying for months to recapture the city's eastern half, which has long been a major opposition stronghold.
""I am deeply alarmed by the ferocious pummelling of eastern Aleppo city,"" Mr O'Brien, UN under-secretary for humanitarian affairs, said in a statement.
""Indiscriminate bombing and shelling continues in a shocking and unrelenting manner, killing and maiming civilians, subjecting them to a level of savagery that no human should have to endure.""
The healthcare system in eastern Aleppo had been ""all but obliterated"", he added.
On Saturday, air strikes hit Aleppo's main trauma M10 hospital for the third time in a matter of days, medical workers say.
""The hospital is now out of service completely,"" radiologist Mohammad Abu Rajab was quoted by Reuters as saying.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based opposition monitoring group, said dozens of Russian air strikes overnight had targeted front-line ""fighting zones"".
A correspondent with AFP news agency said the districts of Bustan al-Basha, Sakhur and Suleiman al-Halabi were all hit.
Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said the strikes had helped pro-government troops to advance in the north of the city, reaching the outskirts of al-Halaq district.
""Regime forces aims to control Bustan al-Basha and Sakhur districts, to tighten the zones controlled by rebels,"" he said.
Ismael Abdullah, a volunteer with Syrian civil defence group the White Helmets, told the BBC: ""The bombing started from the morning. There are air strikes in the al-Maja neighbourhood and rescue teams are there to get the people out from under the rubble.""
Russia and the US are at loggerheads over ending the conflict in Syria, both supporting opposing sides in the five-year civil war.
A US-Russia brokered cessation of hostilities recently collapsed and the US had threatened to end co-operation with the Kremlin unless Russia halts its military campaign.
For its part, Russia accuses the US of secretly supporting the powerful jihadist group Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly known as al-Nusra Front) in its attempts to unseat President Bashar al-Assad.
It has emerged that Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his US counterpart John Kerry talked again on Saturday about the situation in Aleppo.
But there was still no sign of any diplomatic breakthrough that might end the bloodshed.
Once Syria's commercial and industrial hub, Aleppo has been divided roughly in two since 2012.
At least 250,000 people have been killed in the conflict, with the observatory estimating the true number to be about 430,000.
More than 4.8 million people have fled abroad, and an estimated 6.5 million others have been displaced within the country, the UN says.","Civilians in the rebel-held part of the Syrian city of Aleppo are enduring a ""living hell"", the UN humanitarian chief has said, as fighting rages on.",37534094

"Disagreement over when the event was first held means the carnival's 50th anniversary will be marked again this year, as it was in 2014 and 2015.
The first parades in the 1960s had many similarities to those held now.
BBC News looks at how the event has developed into what organisers claim is the largest street party in Europe.
In 1959 a Caribbean style cabaret was held at St Pancras Town Hall to showcase the styles of carnival.
Other Caribbean events were held in London during the 1960s before a parade was organised in Notting Hill by a team led by social worker Rhuanne Laslett.
The organisers said the aim of the festival was to bring cultures together through arts and Caribbean steel bands.
By the 1970s the festival was attracting increasing numbers of performers each year to west London.
But racial tension simmered at some events with a riot following the carnival in 1976.
Static sound systems, like this one seen in 1981, have become a major part of the event. There are now 38 separate sound systems as well as the World Music Stage at Powis Square.
Relations between police and the organisers have improved over the years.
The carnival has always attracted a diverse crowd, like this punk in 1984.
Masquerade bands, sound systems, steel bands, calypso and soca music are all carnival mainstays.
The costume troupes who parade each year are known as Mas or Masquerade bands.
International stars have made appearances at the carnival, like Wyclef Jean in 2003.
Jouvert marks the start of the carnival on Sunday morning, where performers cover each other in paint and chocolate.
Veteran DJ Norman Jay, seen here in 2006, has become a mainstay at the carnival with his Good Times sound system.
As well the costumes, music and dancing, the carnival is well known for its street food...
...as well as the enormous queues for the carnival toilets.
Samba band Batala have made numerous appearances and will be returning again in 2016.
The Sunday parade is more child-friendly and proves popular with families.
Revellers will be hoping for an improvement in the weather compared to 2015.

"The alert was raised at about 13:10 BST after the man's kayak capsized on the River Wey at Guildford and he went into the water near a weir.
A police helicopter, firefighters and ambulance crews are all at the scene.
Ch Insp Dave Mason, of Surrey Police, said he had been seen in difficulty because of the strong current.
""We have a large number of officers out looking for this man alongside a number of fire crews,"" he said.
""The man was spotted in the water by several members of the public and was clearly in difficulty due to the extremely strong current.
""We are doing everything we can to try and find him.""
He urged anyone who sees the man not to go into the river, but to call 999 immediately.

"More attacks like those in Mumbai in 2008 and Paris last November could be being planned, Rob Wainwright said.
He was speaking as Europol opened its new counter-terror centre in The Hague.
The unit will seek to improve information exchange and identify the links between terrorism and other areas of crime.
The need was highlighted in particular by the Paris attacks on 13 November that killed 130 people. On Sunday, the Islamic State group posted a video apparently showing nine of the suspected gunmen before they carried out those attacks.
What is Islamic State?
Who were the Paris attackers?
Paris attacks: Who were the victims?
Paris attacks: What happened on the night
The opening of the centre coincided with Europol's new report on IS.
The Paris attacks and the downing of a Russian airliner over Egypt last October ""suggest a shift in IS strategy towards going global"", it says.
""IS is preparing more terrorist attacks, including more 'Mumbai-style' attacks, to be executed in member states of the EU, and in France in particular,"" the report, Changes in modus operandi of Islamic State terrorist attacks, says.
""The attacks will be primarily directed at soft targets, because of the impact it generates.""
It suggests refugees fleeing Syria and other nations for Europe may be vulnerable to recruitment.
""Indeed there are reports that refugee centres are being specifically targeted by Islamic extremist recruiters,"" the report says.
Other points in the report:
Mr Wainwright said more than 5,000 EU nationals had been radicalised fighting abroad and many had returned home.
Europe's leaders, he said, had decided to establish ""for the first time a dedicated pan-European operational centre to combat terrorism"".
Mr Wainwright said the centre's priority would be to improve information exchange between EU members.
It will also focus on links to other criminal sectors.
Mr Wainwright said: ""We know that many terrorist suspects, such as those responsible for the terrible attacks in Paris, have a criminal background, are linked with the drugs sector, firearms and other criminal sectors.
""Critical to Europol, therefore, functioning as the EU's information hub on countering crime and terrorism will be to uncover those links.""
The new unit will have between 40 and 50 experts in counterterrorism.
Europol has in total about 800 staff at its headquarters in The Hague. They work with law enforcement agencies in the 28 member states and in other non-EU partner nations to combat serious crime.","Self-styled Islamic State has developed a new ""special forces"" style of combat to target Europe, the director of the EU's police agency Europol says.",35401514
"The pygmy marmosets at Skansen zoo in Stockholm had been destined for a Riyadh zoo.
""They didn't want the monkeys anymore because of the political situation,"" said Skansen zoo boss Jonas Wahlstrom.
Last month the Saudi ambassador to Sweden was recalled, after Sweden ended an arms deal in a human rights dispute.
Weighing just over 100 grams (3.5 oz) each pygmy marmosets are the smallest primates in the world.
""It's a little comical. I'll just have to wait until they grant visas to Swedish businessmen again. Maybe monkeys will get visas then too,"" said Mr Wahlstrom, quoted by Radio Sweden.
Last month Saudi Arabia attacked Sweden's Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom for an ""offensive"" speech which it called ""blatant interference"" in its internal affairs.

"The blast led to the partial collapse of the five-floor building in Mansoura, 110km (70 miles) north of Cairo.
Interim Prime Minister Hazem Beblawi called it ""an act of terrorism"".
There have been a series of attacks on the security forces claimed by Islamist militants since the military deposed President Mohammed Morsi in July.
No group has so far said it was behind Tuesday's attack, but security officials said it bore the hallmarks of the Sinai-based Salafist-jihadist group, Ansar Beit al-Maqdis.
The military-backed interim government said it was an attempt to scare people ahead of next month's referendum on a new constitution - but that the violence would not disrupt voting.
Although Mr Beblawi did not directly blame the Brotherhood, one of his spokesmen said it had showed ""its ugly face as a terrorist organisation, shedding blood and messing with Egypt's security"".
At a funeral for the victims, who included at least 12 policemen, hundreds of people chanted: ""The people want to execute the Brotherhood"".
Some in the crowd held up posters reading ""no to terrorist groups"" and set fire to the car of a man who flashed a pro-Morsi symbol, while others attacked houses belonging to a leading member of the Brotherhood, according to the Associated Press.
The Brotherhood condemned the bombing, describing it as a ""direct attack on the unity of the Egyptian people"". It also accused the government of ""exploiting"" the violence to target its members and ""create further violence, chaos and instability"".
The explosion shook the building at about 01:10 (23:10 GMT on Monday).
Media reports say the provincial security chief was among those hurt. Officials said most of the casualties were police officers.
The blast shattered windows of nearby buildings and its impact was felt about 20km (12 miles) away, the reports say.
Mansoura - a city of about 480,000 people - is the capital of Dakahliya province in the Nile Delta region.
Since the removal of Mr Morsi - Egypt's first democratically elected president - his supporters have been staging mass rallies demanding his immediate release.
More than 2,000 Muslim Brotherhood members have been arrested, and 450 of them on Monday went on hunger strike in protest at their ""inhumane treatment"".
Mr Morsi is now facing three separate criminal trials relating to his time in office.
The first trial opened on 4 November, but has been adjourned until 8 January.","At least 15 people have been killed and more than 100 others injured in a car bomb attack on a security building in northern Egypt, officials say.",25501732

But, with the home side fighting to scramble out of the play-off spot, it was they who pushed on early looking for the breakthrough.
Miles Addison, Boyd and Greg Kiltie all spurned decent opportunities in the first 10 minutes.
However, as Thistle rode the storm, they started to look more assured in possession.
David Amoo could have put the Jags ahead on 15 minutes, but the midfielder's close-range header was directed straight at goalkeeper Jamie MacDonald.

There was an air of desperation about Kilmarnock in the second half, but as they pushed and pushed they were punished by Thistle's top striker, Kris Doolan, who doubled the visitors lead just after the hour.
He found himself one-on-one with MacDonald and held his nerve to slot the ball low past the on-rushing goalkeeper.

"US officials have confirmed that one Navy commando died and three more service members were wounded, and say 14 al-Qaeda fighters were killed. Unconfirmed reports suggested a number of civilians were killed, including an eight-year-old girl whose father and brother were killed in drone strikes six years ago.
Here's what we know and what's been reported.
The US operatives targeted the house of a suspected senior AQAP leader in the mountainous Yakla region of Bayda province - the focal point of recent US drone strikes in Yemen.
A Pentagon spokesman said the clandestine mission - the first authorised by President Donald Trump - was an intelligence-gathering operation designed to retrieve computer hard drives.
The US commandos were dropped near the target location and engaged in a firefight with suspected AQAP militants. Chief Petty Officer William Owens, a member of the elite US Navy special forces unit Seal Team 6, was killed and one other service member was wounded.
AQAP said in a statement that Abdul Rauf al-Dhahab, one of its leaders, was killed in the fighting. This has not been confirmed by the US.
At first, US officials said only that 14 AQAP fighters were killed and denied that there were civilian casualties. But reports credited to Yemeni officials and medics on the ground said that 16 civilians were killed, including women and children.
Asked on Monday about the reports, Pentagon spokesman Capt Jeff Davis said that some of the AQAP fighters were women.
He said: ""Take reports of female casualties with a grain of salt. Not all female casualties are civilian casualties. In many cases, and certainly in this one, females can be legitimate combatants.""
Other reports said that an eight-year-old girl, Nawar al-Awlaki, was killed. Her grandfather, who was not at the scene, said in interviews with NBC and Reuters news agency that she was shot dead by US forces. Her uncle also posted to Facebook to say she had died.
Images circulated on social media and by local media outlets purported to show her body.
Nawar is the daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, a suspected senior al-Qaeda leader killed by a US drone strike in 2011. Her 16-year-old brother, Abdulrahman, was killed by another US drone strike two weeks after the death of their father.
Asked about the boy's death at the time, Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary under Barack Obama, said: ""Maybe he should've had a more responsible father.""
There has been no official confirmation of Nawar's death from Yemeni or US officials.
Capt Davis said the raid had been planned months ago by the Obama administration but that the plans were handed over to the Trump administration, which authorised it as its first combat action.

"Rebellion, which prints the character's stories in 2000 AD, is teaming up with studio IM Global to produce the ""big-budget"" series.
It is the first time the futuristic lawman's on-screen escapades are being overseen by the Oxford-based publisher.
Rebellion said development of the project, titled Judge Dredd: Mega-City One, has begun, with the cast to be announced at a later date.
The programme will be filmed in the UK, a spokesman said.
Jason and Chris Kingsley, the owners of Rebellion, said: ""We're very excited to be beginning the journey to get more of Judge Dredd's Mega-City One on the television screen.
""Thanks to the legions of fans who have kept up pressure on social media, and a lot of background work and enthusiasm, we aim to make a big budget production that will satisfy both our vast comics audience and the even greater general screen-watching public.""
Judge Dredd patrols an over-populated metropolis in the 22nd Century, where he has the powers of a judge, jury and executioner.
Created by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra in 1977, his satirical stories took inspiration from hard-edged cop movies and the punk movement.
He has previously been portrayed in films by Sylvester Stallone in 1995 and Karl Urban in 2012.
Mark Stern, executive producer on the show, previously worked for the Syfy channel on Battlestar Galactica.
He described Dredd as ""one of those seminal sci-fi properties that seems to only become and more relevant with age"".
He added: ""Not only is it a rich world with biting social commentary, but it's also fun as hell.
""As a fan of the comics and both films, it's a dream come true to be able to work with Jason and Chris in adapting this for television.""

"They say they are lacking the brains of people with disorders such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.
In part, this shortage results from a lack of awareness that such conditions are due to changes in brain wiring.
The researchers' aim is to develop new treatments for mental and neurological disorders.
The human brain is as beautiful as it is complex. Its wiring changes and grows as we do. The organ is a physical embodiment of our behaviour and who we are.
In recent years, researchers have made links between the shape of the brain and mental and neurological disorders.
More than 3,000 brains are storied at the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center at McLean Hospital just outside Boston. It is one of the largest brain banks in the world.
Most of their specimens are from people with mental or neurological disorders.
Samples are requested by scientists to find new treatments for Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and a whole host of psychiatric disorders.
But there is a problem. Scientists at McLean Hospital and at brain banks across the world do not have enough specimens for the research community.
According Dr Kerry Ressler, who is the chief scientific officer at McLean hospital, new treatments for many mental and neurological diseases are within the grasp of the research community. However, he says it is the lack of brain tissue that is holding back their development.
""We have the tools and the ability to do some great deep-level biology of the human brain now.
""What we are lacking are the tissues from those with the disorders we need to really understand.""
One donor visiting the hospital, who wished to be known only as Caroline, told BBC News that she decided to donate her brain for medical research partly because her sister has schizophrenia.
She hopes that her donation will help researchers find a cure – and she's urging others to do the same.
“My parents were fine but why did my sister get schizophrenia? We are not sure where it came from. How are we going to find out if we don’t do the research on the brain, which is where the problem is.""
There is a shortage of brains from people with disorders that are incorrectly seen as psychological – rather than neurological in origin. These include depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.
Prof Sabina Berretta, the scientific director of the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Centre, said: ""If people think that there are no changes in the brain of somebody that suffers from major depression or post-traumatic stress disorder then there is no reason for them to donate their brain for research because (they think that) there is nothing there to find.

"UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the civilians were at ""great risk"" and called for the provision of safe corridors to allow them to leave.
Soldiers, police and militiamen began an offensive to retake Falluja, 50km (30 miles) west of Baghdad, on Monday.
The city has been held by IS longer than any other in Iraq or Syria.
The jihadists overran Falluja in January 2014, six months before it routed the Iraqi army and seized control of large parts of northern and western Iraq.
Although the offensive to recapture Falluja was launched on Monday, Iraqi government forces have besieged the city and its suburbs for several months.
Residents reported a second day of shelling on Tuesday, although it was less intensive than on Monday.
""No-one can leave. It's dangerous. There are snipers everywhere along the exit routes,"" one resident told Reuters by internet.
The UN says there have been no deliveries of aid since IS militants were driven from the nearby city of Ramadi in December and supply routes were cut.
The tens of thousands of civilians living in Falluja have faced acute shortages of food, medicine and other essential items. Prices have escalated dramatically.
The Iraqi military has urged all civilians to leave Falluja. It has instructed those unable to escape to raise a white flag over their location and stay away from IS positions and gatherings.
""No-one can leave. It's dangerous. There are snipers everywhere along the exit routes,"" one resident told the Reuters news agency by internet.
Mr Dujarric said the UN was ""very concerned"" about the fate of the civilians that remain in Fallujah.
The UN says women and children have died while trying to escape the city.
Falluja has been attacked many times and bombed and shelled almost incessantly since it fell into the militants' hands in January 2014. It has withstood all that, despite huge destruction and many casualties.
Now the government has committed itself to ""liberating"" the city once and for all, in an operation codenamed ""Break Terrorism"".
But there are conflicting assessments of how tough the battle will be.
Some believe that IS has taken such a pounding in the town that its ability to resist has been sapped. Others, in touch with sources inside the beleaguered city, say the militants have long been preparing to face such an offensive and have deployed their full array of defences, including many roadside bombs and booby traps.
How tough will it be to recapture Falluja from IS?
""The humanitarian situation obviously remains very fluid as the fighting is ongoing.""
Mr Dujarric said civilians would ""come under great danger as they try to flee"" and that it was important that there were some safe corridors that they could use.
UNHCR spokeswoman Leila Jane Nassif said 80 families were believed to have fled Falluja since Friday.
Ms Nassif also expressed concern for the safety of men and older boys who survived the escape. She said they were being separated from the women and other children by security forces and taken for security screening at Habbaniya military base.
In the event that civilians are able to leave Falluja, the UN and other humanitarian organisations have set up shelters for them in nearby towns.
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who has instructed the military to ""preserve the lives of citizens"" in Falluja, said on Monday that government forces had made better progress than expected.
Shia militias are reinforcing the army and police spearheading the offensive on the predominantly Sunni Arab city. But they will be restricted to operating outside the city limits, officials say.

"Research suggests synaesthesia is nearly three times as common in adults with autism spectrum disorder than in the general population.
The two conditions may share common features such as unusual wiring of the brain, say UK scientists.
The study helps understanding of how people with autism experience life, says the National Autistic Society.
Synaesthesia is a condition where one sense automatically triggers another. Some people experience tastes when they read or hear words, some perceive numbers as shapes, others see colours when they hear music.
People with synaesthesia might say: ""The letter q is dark brown,"" or: ""The word 'hello' tastes like coffee,"" for example.
Following anecdotal evidence of links between synaesthesia and Asperger's syndrome, researchers at the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge University set out to test the idea.
More than 200 study participants - 164 adults diagnosed with high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome, and 97 adults without autism - were asked to fill in questionnaires to measure synaesthesia and autism traits.
The study found one in five adults with autism spectrum conditions - a range of related developmental disorders, including autism and Asperger's syndrome - had synaesthesia compared with about 7% of people with no signs of the disorders.
Prof Simon Baron-Cohen, who led the research, told BBC News:  ""Synaesthesia involves a mixing of the senses and it's a very subjective private experience, so the only way we know it's happening is if you ask people to report on their experiences.
""And what this new study has done is ask people whether they experience synaesthesia, for example where a sound triggers the experience of colour or a taste triggers the experience of colour, and finding that these unusual experiences are actually much more common in autism than we previously knew.""
The research, to be published in the journal Molecular Autism, suggests that while the two conditions might appear distinct, there could actually be some underlying similarities in brain connectivity.
Synaesthesia seems to involve unusual connections between brain areas not usually wired together, accounting for the jumbling up of the senses.
One theory about autism is that it involves over-connectivity of neurons, so that a person focuses on small details but finds it difficult to see the big picture.
Future research is needed to explore biological mechanisms behind both conditions, including carrying out detailed brain scans, says the Cambridge University team.
Carol Povey, director of the National Autistic Society's Centre for Autism, said the study could help improve our understanding of autism.
""People with the condition can find everyday life confusing or even frightening, so research like this, which helps us to understand more about how they experience the world, is valuable,"" she said.
""It can help us to develop more appropriate support and to make adjustments according to their needs, which is vital if people with autism are to reach their full potential.
""With the right support at the right time people with autism can live the life they choose.""","A condition where people experience a mixing of the senses, such as tasting words, has been linked with autism.",24995232
"Doris Payne was arrested at a Walmart store in Chamblee, in Georgia, with $86.22 (Â£66) worth of items, police say. She has been released on bail.
She was found wearing an ankle monitor from a previous arrest for shoplifting.
Payne has served multiple jail terms for her crimes. She is thought to have stolen $2m in jewellery and was profiled in a 2013 documentary.
A shop employee observed her stealing several items from the pharmacy, electronics and grocery departments.
Her lawyer, Drew Findling, was quoted by local media as saying: ""This is a sharp contrast to all the cases in the past. We're not talking about high-end jewellery.
""We're talking about what an 86-year-old woman needs to survive on a day-to-day basis, food supplies and medical supplies.""

Young British Muslims discuss radicalisation
What should you do in an attack?
Stories from Britons caught up in the attacks are still emerging.
One couple from Leeds have described how they escaped through a skylight when the Bataclan concert hall was attacked.
Tony Scott and Justine Merton climbed onto the roof when heavily-armed gunmen stormed the building, during an Eagles of Death Metal concert.
The engaged pair, who first met at a rock concert, usually watched gigs at floor level but they had arrived late so headed up to the balcony for a good view.
Mr Scott told BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme the ""insignificant"" decision to go upstairs ended up being ""the difference between life and death"".
From there, they were able to escape into the stairwell, climb up a grate and out onto the roof. They were then ushered to an apartment where they hid with others, before armed police eventually found them.
Another couple, also at the concert, described how they went back inside to rescue a friend hurt in the crush to escape.
Maria and Patrick Moore, from Southampton, were unharmed but they walked to hospital with their friend, who had a broken collarbone.
""I don't feel different but there's guilt that we got out and other people didn't,"" Mrs Moore, now back home, told the Southern Daily Echo.
The three gunmen at the concert hall killed 89 people, among them Mr Alexander, 36, who was selling merchandise at the gig.
His friend, David Gray, said Nick ""didn't stand a chance of getting out"" because his stall was by the front door and the emergency exits were at the sides of the stage.
Band members of Eagles of Death Metal tweeted: ""Our thoughts and hearts are first and foremost with our brother Nick Alexander.""

""She said, 'It seems like I am never going to have it again',"" Mrs Larsson, a former journalist who works in physiotherapy, recalled. ""I thought, she has real cravings for sugar. She did not want to eat the food we are making, all she wants to eat are things like sweet yoghurts.""
Within days of making the decision to cut down on sugary treats, the difference was clear.
""She was calming down so quickly, falling asleep so quickly in the evenings - and she did not want to look at the television all the time, she wanted to do things.""
However, while it is widely believed that sugar can affect behaviour, there is little scientific evidence to back this up.

"The Smoking Matters service in Dumfries and Galloway helped 102 people in deprived areas kick the habit in the past year - 251 below target.
Public Health Consultant Dr Andrew Carnon said the trend was being mirrored across Scotland.
He said many people saw e-cigarettes as a stepping stone to stopping smoking.
Nationwide figures have shown a similar trend to those in the south west of Scotland.
In 2013, the Information Services Division reported that the number of attempts to stop smoking had fallen by 13% compared with 2012.
That was the first decrease seen in recent years and it was also suggested this could be ""partly explained"" by the rise in the use of e-cigarettes.
Dr Carnon said that although there was still a lack of evidence about their effectiveness, the NHS might have to review and adapt its smoking cessation service in the future.
However, he said he believed that there would always be a need for support services in that provision.
""The position of e-cigarettes is at the moment not fully clear because they are so new there hasn't been all the research carried out,"" he said.
""We actually don't know at this stage just how effective they are in helping people to stop smoking.
""There is also a risk, potentially at least, that smokers may use them in certain settings where they are not allowed to smoke tobacco but without any intention of actually stopping smoking tobacco cigarettes.""
He said that was clearly a case where they would not be of any benefit to a smoker's health.
""The third possibility, which again would not be a great one, is that people who don't smoke might feel that e-cigarettes are something that are much safer that they would like to try,"" he added.
""We just don't have the research evidence at the moment to say whether there is a risk that those people who might simply be experimenting with e-cigarettes might get drawn into using tobacco cigarettes at a later stage.""
Dr Carnon said it was clear from research that people had the best chance of quitting with some support.
""It is not just about the nicotine replacement, it is not just about use of e-cigarettes,"" he said.
""It is actually about working with somebody to help you through the difficult process - because it's not easy to quit smoking.
""So really we would encourage people either to go to the smoking cessation service which is called Smoking Matters or to one of their local pharmacies who can help them or they can ask their GP if they would like some advice.""",A sharp decline in the number of smokers using an NHS support programme to help them quit has been linked to the rise in popularity of e-cigarettes.,33786082
"Karate, sports climbing and baseball/softball are the other three sports proposed by the International Olympic Committee's executive board.
A decision will be made during an IOC session held on 1-4 August before the Rio Olympics start on 5 August.
An IOC statement said the sports ""offer a key focus on youth, which is at the heart of the Games vision for Tokyo"".
It added: ""They represent a combination of well-established and emerging sports with significant popularity in Japan and beyond.
""If approved, the change would be the most comprehensive evolution of the Olympic programme in modern history.""
Future Games hosts are being given a chance to bring in one or more sports popular in their country to boost ratings and attract greater sponsorship.
Tokyo organisers had put forward these five sports last September and on Wednesday the IOC executive board voted unanimously in favour of the proposal.
The decision to add the five sports would not affect the current quota of sports at the Olympics and future Games would not necessarily have to include the same five sports.

"Rad Wagon organised the knitting of 2,000 miniature jerseys which were hung in the streets for Monday's race.
""We've had requests for them from as far away as the USA so we've asked people to donate to charities. It'll be another great Tour legacy,"" he said.
Funds will go to Jimmy's, You Can Bike Too and Marie Curie.
Cycling instructor and non-knitter Mr Wagon was inspired to create the knitted bunting after seeing a similar project in Yorkshire.
More than 400 people took up their needles to knit over 2,000 miniature jerseys in Tour de France colours.
In addition, primary school pupils helped decorate some of the 40 wool-covered bicycle wheels hung along the route in Cambridge.
The bunting was taken down on Wednesday, and Mr Wagon and friends have been busy dealing with requests from individuals and organisations keen to have some.
""Almost everyone used their own materials, lots of wool was donated and everyone gave their time for free so of course we said they could have their jerseys back,"" Mr Wagon said.
""Then we started getting requests from people who had seen the bunting on television and the internet and wanted some as souvenirs because it looked so great.
""We picked our charities and have asked people if they would like to donate something. We're not selling it as such, just asking people if they'd like to help these causes.""

"The Nordic nation will start turning off the FM signal at 11:11 local time (10:11 GMT) on Wednesday, in favour of Digital Audio Broadcasting, or DAB.
The digital signal gives better quality and coverage than analogue - and for about an eighth of the cost.
But there are some who are concerned about the switch-off's potential impact on the elderly and motorists.
According to a December poll published in the Dagbladet daily newspaper, two-thirds of Norwegians think the government is moving too quickly.
By the end of the year, national networks will only be available on DAB, while local stations have five years to make the switch.
And despite 70% of Norway's listeners already using DAB to tune into their favourite stations, critics say too many people will be forced to make expensive upgrades to their equipment.
A new car radio, for example, costs in the region of NOK4,000 ($468; Â£382).
""Norway is not prepared for this. There are millions of radios in homes, cottages and boats that won't work anymore and only around 25% of cars in Norway have digital radios or adapters,'' said Svein Larsen, of the Norwegian Local Radio Association.
Others, however, want to cling onto FM - invented in the US in 1933 - for the memories.
Marius Lillelien, head of radio at the national broadcaster NRK, said: ""Of course there is a lot of nostalgia in radio. That's one of the reasons this switch is so controversial.
""But that means people love radio and nostalgia is an asset to us whether we are broadcasting in analogue or on DAB.""
Ministers remain undaunted by the change, and countries like Switzerland and Britain - both considering a switch to digital networks - will no doubt be closely watching how the switch goes over the next few months.",Norway is the first country in the world to start switching off its analogue radio signals.,38578050
"In the New York-based production, Julius Caesar is depicted as a blond-haired businessman in a blue suit.
The production company, Public Theater, said the character was a contemporary Caesar ""bent on absolute power"".
One of the sponsors, Delta Air Lines, said the producers had ""crossed the line on the standards of good taste"".
In the Shakespearean tragedy, which is staged in New York's Central Park, Caesar is assassinated in a lengthy scene in which he fights off his attackers before succumbing to multiple stab wounds.
The lead character's wife in the play, Calpurnia, is depicted wearing designer outfits and speaking with an apparent Slavic accent - suggesting that she is based on First Lady Melania Trump, who is Slovenian.
The company released a statement saying it stood behind its production.
""We recognise that our interpretation of the play has provoked heated discussion; audiences, sponsors and supporters have expressed varying viewpoints and opinions,"" the statement said. ""Such a discussion is exactly the goal of our civically-engaged theater"".
The company added its production in no way advocated violence and pointed out the message was that ""those who attempt to defend democracy by undemocratic means pay a terrible price and destroy the very thing they are fighting to save"".
On its website, the company states that the play is about ""how fragile democracy is,"" adding that it highlights how the ""institutions that we have grown up with can be swept away in no time at all"".

Delta said on Monday that the ""graphic staging of Julius Caesar"" at the Free Shakespeare in the Park event ""does not reflect"" the airline's values.
President Trump's son, Donald Junior, criticised the production, asking whether boundaries had been crossed in what he described as art becoming political speech.
""I wonder how much of this 'art' is funded by taxpayers?"" he tweeted, adding: ""Serious question, when does 'art' become political speech & does that change things?""
On Monday afternoon, the National Endowment of the Arts answered Mr Trump's question on its website, noting that ""no taxpayer dollars support Shakespeare in the Park's production of Julius Caesar"".
The play opened with previews on 23 May and the production is due to run until 18 June.
Delta and the other sponsor to withdraw, Bank of America, have both supported the Shakespeare season in Central Park for several years.
In a 2012 production of Julius Caesar by New York-based The Acting Company, the Roman leader was modelled on then-President Barack Obama.
Commenting on the row, Gregory Doran, the artistic director of the UK's Royal Shakespeare Company, said that Shakespeare could often surprise modern audiences with how ""relevant"" he is.
""Though he often set his plays in periods and places that were remote from his own, by doing so he could talk freely about his own society,"" he said.
""We constantly reapply that metaphor to our own times.

First staged on Broadway in 1980, 42nd Street was named best musical at the following year's Tony Awards.
Its original London production, whose cast included a young Catherine Zeta-Jones, won the Olivier award for best musical in 1984.
Zeta-Jones was a second understudy on the production who got a chance to perform when both leading lady Barbara King and her first understudy were indisposed.

Provisional figures suggest more than 340mm of rain fell in 24 hours in the Lake District. The current record is 316.4mm of rain over the same time period at Seathwaite, Cumbria, in 2009.
In Cumbria, where a major incident was declared, emergency crews used boats to carry people to safety and eight rescue centres are open for those forced to leave their homes.
Rescue teams from the Royal National Lifeboat Institution evacuated homes in Carlisle, helping around 200 people.

Roger and Julie Scoon, of Keswick, put their furniture in a room that was safe during the 2009 floods - but this time around the water came in through the windows.
""We did what we could, we got flood gates, we put tiled floors down so we can mop out, but we never dreamt it would come up here,"" Mr Scoon added.
The couple, who had been due to sell their house when the flooding hit, said of where they would be for Christmas: ""We can't think that far ahead... we'll just take it a day at a time really.""
John Chadwick was helped from his home in Carlisle.
""I was evacuated as the River Caldew burst over the flood barriers.
""I live alone and have severe mobility problems including osteoarthritis and mild epilepsy - I just had time to grab some medication.
""I have nowhere suitable to stay as I need ground floor accommodation with disabled access. Social services informed me that they were inundated and I would just have to rough it out at a friend's place a short distance away.
""The waters were 2in deep and I got out by dinghy.""
In 2010, a Â£38m flood defence scheme for Carlisle - which has seen some of the worst flooding - was completed in a bid to protect about 3,000 homes and businesses around the city.
Floods minister Rory Stewart said defences - which have been criticised - had given authorities more time to evacuate people and kept flood levels down.
The defences ""held strong"" but the huge levels of rain were too much for them, he said.
However, Mayor of Keswick Paul Titley said the defences had been ""completely overwhelmed"".
""The flood defences were designed for a one in 100-year event and since it's six years since we had the last one, we were sort of surprised that we got one so soon,"" he added.

Willian struck from 25 yards to give the hosts the lead while Loic Remy doubled Chelsea's advantage with a well-taken half-volley from 12 yards.
Kurt Zouma completed the scoring, heading in Cesar Azpilicueta's cross.
With the influential quartet of Cesc Fabregas, Nemanja Matic, Costa and Eden Hazard not starting - Jose Mourinho made eight changes to the team which lost to Tottenham - it was perhaps no surprise the hosts did not immediately click.
But Mourinho's men have suffered a dip in form of late, letting an eight-point advantage in the Premier League slip.

"Ex-Navy steward Craig Bryden donned his costume on Friday and caught a bus on his way to hospital in Portsmouth.
He sat next to passenger Courtney Jones whose selfie with the 55-year-old has attracted hundreds of comments online.
Mr Bryden, who has been labelled the ""Pompey Pirate"", said he wanted to put a smile on people's faces.
Mr Bryden, from Copnor, spent 20 years in the navy, surviving the sinking of HMS Sheffield when it was hit by an Exocet missile during the Falklands War.
He said: ""I've got this inside me and it is going to kill me but between now and then I'm going to embrace life to the full.
""If I can put a smile on one person's face every day while I'm slowly ebbing away it will lift me up and keep me going.""
He said he had intended on changing his costume for each session, but the pirate look has gone down so well he is sticking with it.
Ms Jones, whose online post has been shared thousands of times, said: ""He got on the bus and everyone stared; he immediately made me smile.
""We got chatting and he went on to tell me how today was his first lot of chemotherapy... but didn't want to go looking like everyone else and just wanted to make people smile.

"Around ten miles of trails have been published online after an environment group borrowed a special camera from technology company Google.
Using the backpack camera, volunteers walked the paths recording imagery which took almost a year to stitch together.
People can now view the paths in 360 degree detail, using the information to plan a day out.
The Belfast Hills Partnership hopes it will encourage more people to use the trails. the special backpack contained 15 cameras each taking 24 images a minute.
GPS technology logged location information. Four volunteers were used to do the work last summer.
The result is now available through Google Maps' Street View function.

"The video, filmed on Friday, shows an officer in McKinney, Texas pinning a black 15-year-old girl in a bikini to the ground with his knees.
The protesters are demanding that the police officer, who is white, should be dismissed.
The officer, Corporal David Eric Casebolt, has been placed on leave.
In a statement posted on Facebook, McKinney police said they were called because a number of uninvited people refused to leave the swimming pool.
A fight then broke out, and more calls were made to police.
In a video that is more than seven minutes long, Mr Casebolt is shown swearing at a number of black youths, pointing his gun at others, and pulling the girl by her arm, before pinning her to the ground with his knees.
""Call my momma!"" the girl screams several times as she struggles with the officer.
The girl, Dajerria Becton, told the Texan broadcaster KDFW: ""Him getting fired isn't enough.""
On Monday night, close to 800 people marched through McKinney, a city of almost 150,000 people.
They walked from a school to the swimming pool, carrying placards with slogans including ""My skin colour is not a crime"" and ""Don't tread on our kids"".
Civil rights leaders in McKinney said they wanted an investigation by the US justice department, and to see Mr Casebolt dismissed.
The incident comes at a time of heightened scrutiny about how US police forces respond to minorities.
Protests have followed the deaths of several African Americans in police incidents since July 2014 - Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Eric Garner in New York, Freddie Gray in Baltimore and Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Ohio.
Benet Embry, a radio host who witnessed the incident, defended the police, saying: ""That's what they are supposed to do - protect us.
""I don't know any other way he could have taken her down or established order.""

"Ministers won Wednesday's House of Commons vote, with 498 MPs voting for the European Union Bill to go to the next stage, and 114 against.
Of those, 27 MPs from Wales - including 16 Labour and 11 Tory - voted for the bill, with 10 against.
The proposed law would allow ministers to start the Brexit process.
Following a Commons debate, seven Welsh Labour MPs including frontbencher Kevin Brennan were among 47 who defied party orders by voting against the measure.
The bill will now return to the Commons next week for the committee stage, when opposition parties will try to push through a series of amendments.
Clwyd West Conservative MP David Jones tweeted it was a ""historic day"". Wales backed leaving the EU in the referendum last year.
Shadow culture minister Mr Brennan was the second Labour front-bencher in Wales to announce he would vote against Jeremy Corbyn's wishes, following Jo Stevens who quit as shadow Welsh secretary on Friday over the order.
Mr Corbyn suggested at the weekend that shadow ministers who choose to vote against triggering Article 50 could be sacked.
On his blog, Mr Brennan said: ""I believe it is now quite clear that triggering Article 50 will lead Britain on a road to the kind of economy and society I have never believed in.
""That is also the view of the majority of my constituents.""

He said the vote was an ""opportunity for all of us to demonstrate"" respect for the referendum's outcome ""by supporting this small and important bill"".
David Davies, Conservative MP for Monmouth and a prominent Leave campaigner in Wales, told MPs: ""Stop fighting the campaign and become part of what is going to take place now.
""Our prime minister tonight is going to reflect the will of the British people.""
One of the Labour MPs to vote for the bill, Carolyn Harris, tweeted that the number of constituents who had contacted her to vote for Article 50 outweighed those that asked her to vote against.

"A Harvard University team came up with a way to drive down the cost of flow battery technology, which is capable of storing energy on large scales - within an electrical power grid, for example.
Grid-scale storage for renewables could be a game-changer - making wind and solar more economical and reliable.
Details appear in the journal Nature.
While flow battery designs are suited to storing large amounts of energy cheaply, they have previously relied on chemicals that are expensive or difficult to maintain, driving up costs.
Most previous flow batteries have chemistries based on metals. Vanadium is used in the most commercially advanced flow battery technology, but its cost is relatively high. Other variants contain precious metal catalysts such as platinum.
The researchers say their new battery already performs as well as vanadium flow batteries, but uses no precious metal catalyst and has an underlying chemistry that is metal-free, instead relying on naturally abundant, more affordable chemicals called quinones.
These water-soluble compounds are organic (carbon-based) and are similar to chemicals that store energy in plants and animals.
""These molecules are cheap and they're in all green vegetables, as well as crude oil,"" said co-author Michael Aziz from the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
The mismatch between the availability of intermittent wind or sunshine and the changing demand for grid electricity is one of the main obstacles to boosting the fraction of energy that comes from renewable sources.
Prof Aziz told the Nature podcast: ""What do you do when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing? This problem is the one we think we can solve with a way to store massive amounts of electrical energy, if we can make it cost effective and safe. And we think we've taken a big step in that direction now.""
Much like fuel cells, flow batteries store energy in chemical fluids contained by external tanks, instead of within the battery container itself as do the solid-electrode batteries found in cars and mobile devices.
""[A flow battery is] similar to a fuel cell in that respect. It stores energy as hydrogen gas outside the fuel cell and when you need to convert that chemical energy into electrical energy, you run it through the fuel cell to make electricity,"" Prof Aziz explained.
""The difference with a flow battery is that you need to run it forwards and backwards. You run it backwards to turn the electrical energy into chemical energy and store it in the tanks. Then you run it forwards to get the energy back out, converting the chemical energy back into electricity.""
The amount of energy that can be stored by a flow battery is limited only by the size of the tanks and the amounts of storage chemicals that can be afforded, he added.
In an accompanying article in Nature, Grigorii Soloveichik, from General Electric Global Research in New York, called the results ""promising"", and said the approach ""may serve as the basis for a new flow-battery technology"".
The scientist, who was not involved with the latest study, added: ""If long-term capacity and energy efficiency retention can be demonstrated, and if practically useful batteries can indeed be prepared cheaply, then this technology will be suitable for a wide array of energy-storage applications.""

"He could more accurately have described us as a nation of shoppers.
Consumer spending is the driver of the UK's economic growth, accounting for about 60% of all our economic activity.
The quickest route to a downturn in that growth figure is consumers who rein in spending.
Today's sharp rise in prices (inflation is now at its highest rate for four years) increases the pressure on the just-about-managing classes.
And savers, once again, are feeling the strain in an era of ultra-low interest rates.
The fall in the value of sterling since the Brexit referendum is the main inflation driver (but not the only one) as it increases the prices of the 40% of food and fuel we import.
And all the basics businesses buy abroad to make the things we purchase or provide us with services.
Of course, it is not all one way traffic.
Sterling's decline is good for exporters and for those global corporations based in the UK which earn a substantial proportion of their revenues in dollars and pay increased dividends to shareholders that include our pension funds.
Some inflation can also be good for an economy as businesses tend to invest more if they assume that prices - and revenues - will rise in the future.
But the clear and present danger from this inflation spike is for consumers.
Which is, pretty much, all of us.
Inflation is now at 2.9%, already above where the Bank of England believed it would peak by the end of this year.
Income growth is at 2.1%.
The incomes squeeze which returned last month has just become tighter.
There is some evidence it is having an effect, although consumers have so far been remarkably resilient in the face of rising prices.
The latest Visa data on credit and debit card activity earlier this week suggested the first fall in consumer spending in four years.
The retail sales figures published on Thursday by the Office for National Statistics will be closely watched.
Last month's saw the biggest quarterly fall in seven years, although the figures can be volatile.
Behind all this data are the real stories of people who are worse off.
Average wage growth masks wide variations, of course.
Those in the public sector have seen their pay either frozen - or rises capped at 1% - since 2010.
And those people who receive in-work benefits to top up their income have not seen those payments rise.
It is into this toxic mix that the question of austerity is thrown - public sector pay and benefits freezes are controlled by the government.
Yes, Theresa May can argue that government debts are still rising and that those debts will have to be paid off by future generations.
The need for ""sound money"" still holds sway among many.
But, if people feel worse off they tend to look to politicians for solutions.
And if there aren't any, they tend to punish incumbents.
Since the Second World War there have only been three elections where real incomes have been falling - 1945, 2010 and 2017.
None of them ended well for the governing party going into the election - even if they had just won a world war.
Nick Timothy, Theresa May's former chief of staff who resigned at the weekend, said voters ""were tired of austerity"".
Today's inflation figure will only make that exhaustion - and pressure on the government to change tack - more acute.",It was Napoleon Bonaparte who once dismissed Britain as a nation of shop keepers.,40262751
"The problem could turn off the engine in affected vehicles while they were being driven, disabling the airbags.
The carmaker announced the recall last month, but it has admitted employees knew about the defect as early as 2004.
The issue has been linked to 13 deaths and GM has also launched an internal investigation into the matter.
Meanwhile, a recent report by the New York Times claimed that the US safety regulator had received more than 260 complaints over the past 11 years about GM vehicles that ""suddenly turned off while being driven"".
""But they declined to investigate the problem,"" the report alleged.
The US House Energy and Commerce Committee said that it is also investigating the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration's (NHTSA) response to consumer complaints related to the problem.
Fred Upton, chairman of the committee, said: ""Did the company or regulators miss something that could have flagged these problems sooner?""
He added: ""We plan to seek detailed information from both NHTSA and GM and will hold a hearing in the coming weeks.""
The recall covers six models: the 2005-07 Chevrolet Cobalt, 2006-07 Chevrolet HHR, 2007 Pontiac G5, 2006-07 Pontiac Solstice, 2003-07 Saturn Ion, and 2007 Saturn Sky.
Recalls are not uncommon in the industry.
However, the issue is being linked to deaths and General Motors' admission that employees knew about the defect for many years may prove tricky for the company.
The NHTSA has already demanded detailed information from GM about when it knew of the problem and how it handled it.
The carmaker could face fines if the regulators rule that it took too long to report safety issues.
The company also faces recall and repair costs as well as potential liability claims.
On Monday, the company said it had hired Anton Valukas, the Chicago-based lawyer who led the court-ordered investigation of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, to lead its internal inquiry into the matter.
GM spokesman Selim Bingol said Mr Valukas ""has been charged to go where the facts take him and give the company an unvarnished report on what happened"".
The recall and the related investigations are the first major challenge for the new chief executive, Mary Barra.
It also comes as GM reported a 22% drop in profits for 2013, hurt by disappointing performance outside North America.

It was one of 50 created to raise funds for Save the Children and Roald Dahl's Marvellous Children's Charity.
The Glasgow jar, which was more than 4ft tall (1.28m), has now been removed from the trail.
Personalities from across the globe, including Steven Spielberg, Prof Stephen Hawking, Simon Cowell, the Duchess of Cornwall and BFG actor Mark Rylance, were invited to help design a jar for the fundraising drive. The sculptures were then created by a specialist design company.

Some of the 20 figures selected in the exhibition include politician Leo Abse and former miner and union activist Dai Donovan, who liaised with the gay rights' group who supported miners during the 1984-5 strike and whose story was included in the 2014 film Pride.

"The Human Rights Committee said so-called bulk data gathering was ""capable of being justified"".
It welcomed the Investigatory Powers Bill as a ""significant step forward"" in human rights terms but said more safeguards were needed.
The Home Office said it welcomed the joint committee's report.
The Investigatory Powers Bill aims to put on a firmer legal footing the collection by the security services of vast quantities of internet data in the UK and personal details held on databases.
Home Secretary Theresa May says these so-called bulk powers have played a significant role in every major counter-terrorism investigation over the past decade.
But civil liberties groups have raised concerns about privacy.
The government has already had to significantly amend its proposals after a draft bill last year was heavily criticised by three parliamentary committees.
The legislation returns to the Commons on Monday for further scrutiny, and the government wants it to become law by the end of year.
Ahead of the debate, the joint committee said in a report that bulk powers were not ""inherently incompatible with the right to respect for private life"", saying it was ""capable of being justified if they have a sufficiently clear legal basis, are shown to be necessary, and are proportionate"".
But it said the operational case for using the power should be assessed by the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, who should report back to Parliament.
On the human rights implications of the bill, the committee welcomed steps towards providing ""a clear and transparent legal basis"" for the investigatory powers being used by security and intelligence agencies.
But it said improvements could be made ""to enhance further the compatibility of the legal framework with human rights"".
The MPs and peers also raised concerns that the wording of clauses concerning the subject matter of targeted interception and equipment interference warrants was ""too broadly drafted"" and suggested it should be tightened to prevent ""large numbers of people"" potentially falling within its scope.
And it said major alterations to warrants should not take place without approval by a judicial commissioner.
""In our view, the power to make major modifications to warrants for targeted interception, without judicial approvals, is so wide as to give rise to real concern that the requirement of judicial authorisation can be circumvented, thereby undermining that important safeguard against arbitrariness,"" it said.
The committee also questioned the robustness of new safeguards for legally privileged communications and called for extra safeguards in relation to MPs' communications and journalists' sources.
Committee chairman Labour's Harriet Harman said: ""Protection for MP communications from unjustified interference is vital, as it is for confidential communications between lawyers and clients.

Winger Dawson got Leigh's Super League homecoming off to an ideal start, opening the scoring after four minutes, with full-back Brown adding a second try soon after.
Prop Cuthbertson was the catalyst for the Rhinos' response, crashing through for a try within a minute of coming off the bench, while hooker Matt Parcell was instrumental in allowing second rower Carl Ablett to get winger Hall over for a second try.
Keinhorst forced his way over for Leeds' third try on 32 minutes, with Sutcliffe edging the visitors further ahead with a drop-goal from 40 metres.
After the interval both sides had chances before Leeds eventually added to the lead after Leigh had Jamie Acton sin-binned for a foul on winger Tom Briscoe.
Despite playing against 12 men, Leeds could only add two points from the boot of Sutcliffe, and Crooks set up a pulsating finish with a try 13 minutes from the end, with Keinhorst then making a try-saving tackle on Atelea Vea to ensure the win.

"The Republican presidential frontrunner claimed that research by the respected Pew organisation showed a ""great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population"" - but he did not refer to any specific study to support that claim, and we can't find one that does.
Mr Trump did cite a specific a study by the Center for Security Policy - ""very highly respected people, who I know, actually"" - which he said showed that 25% of Muslims in the US believed violence against America was justified ""as part of the global jihad"".
Mr Trump's press release:
But what exactly is the Center for Security Policy, and just how highly respected is it?
The CSP was founded in 1988 by Frank Gaffney Jr, a former staffer in the Ronald Reagan administration who has been accused of Islamophobia. On its website, the centre calls itself a ""Special Forces in the War of Ideas"" which offers ""maximum bang for the buck"" to its donors.
The CSP does not publish information about who those donors are, but according to a 2013 report by Salon they include some of the US's biggest aviation and defence companies - Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and General Electric.
Promoted on the organisation's website are reports and books with titles such as Star Spangled Sharia, Civilisation Jihad, and Muslim Colonisation of America. Responding to the controversy over Mr Trump's remarks, the CSP said it was ""necessary to respond to the threat posed by jihadist terror in a way that ... calls it what it is"".
The CSP has been criticised across the political spectrum - by high-profile Republicans as well as Democrats - and by organisations which monitor extremist groups. Terri Johnson, executive director of the Center for New Community and J Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, called it ""an extremist think-tank"" led by an ""anti-Muslim conspiracist"".
The group was heavily criticised in 2012 after it repeatedly accused Huma Abedin, an aide to Hillary Clinton, of being a secret member of the Muslim Brotherhood. Leading Republicans including John McCain and John Boehner denounced the accusations.
The CSP has been criticised by a wide range of extremism monitoring organisations, including the  Anti-Defamation League, and Center for Democratic Values at City University of New York.
Arguably, no. According to the Bridge Initiative, a Georgetown University Islamophobia research project, the CSP survey was an online, self-selecting poll of 600 people, meaning respondents opted in to taking part.
Self-selecting internet surveys are less reliable that more traditional, random polling methods, because the opt-in element can lead to bias. Then there are the existing views of the organisation commissioning the poll - the CSP - which may have influenced the outcome.
The Washington Post called the poll ""shoddy"". According to the Post, the question had an agree/disagree answer format with agree in each case linked to the more controversial option - favouring Sharia law or supporting violence. Researchers say this format is affected by ""acquiescence response bias"" - we are generally more likely to favour agree options.
The CSP said in a statement on Sunday that its research methods were ""consistent with international industry standards"".
Mr Gaffney Jr served in the Reagan administration during the 1980s but left in 1988 to form the CSP, after his nomination as assistant secretary of defence was rejected by the Senate.
""Once a respectable Washington insider,"" according to the Southern Poverty Law Centre, which monitors US hate groups and extremists, Mr Gaffney Jr became ""one of America's most notorious Islamophobes"", the SPLC said.
Mr Gaffney Jr has repeatedly accused parts of America's Muslim population of what he calls ""civilisational jihad"". He has also called for Muslims to be investigated by a ""new and improved"" House Un-American Activities Committee - a highly controversial Cold War-era body which questioned and blacklisted US citizens accused of being communists.","Raising the bar for US political controversy once again, Donald Trump called on Monday for ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"".",35037943

He has been photographed receiving a business award from Theresa May and his family has given more than Â£1.6m to the Liberal Democrats. The 67-year-old is now an adviser to Lib Dem party leader Tim Farron.
Mr Choudhrie and his family run a global business empire that includes hotels, healthcare and aviation.
But an investigation by BBC Panorama and The Guardian suggests he is also one of the world's biggest arms dealers.
Leaked documents from the Choudhries' Swiss bank show that the family's companies were paid almost 100m euros by Russian arms firms in one 12-month period alone.
One company owned by the Choudhrie family, Belinea Services Ltd, received 39.2m euros between October 2007 and October 2008. Another company, Cottage Consultants Ltd, was paid 32.8m euros in the same period, while a third company - Carter Consultants Inc - was paid 23m euros.
Panorama: How Rolls-Royce Bribed Its Way Around The World is on BBC One at 20.30 and available on the BBC iPlayer afterwards.
The leaked documents say one of the Russian arms firms paying the Choudhries ""makes cruise missiles"".
Some of the payments were viewed as suspicious at the time by the Swiss bank Clariden Leu. Its compliance office in Singapore raised anti-money laundering alerts and the Choudhrie family accounts were reviewed by the bank's risk management team.
It's not clear what action - if any - the bank eventually took. But the leaked report describes the payments from the arms companies as ""incoming funds from clients offset business"".
Offset payments are sometimes paid by arms companies to provide investment in the country that is buying the weapons. But anti-corruption campaigners say offset payments can be used as a way of funnelling bribes to middlemen and officials.
In the leaked documents, Clariden Leu describes the Choudhrie family as being ""very wealthy with an overall fortune of approx $2bn"".
Sudhir Choudhrie declined to comment, but lawyers acting for Bhanu Choudhrie have said he had no knowledge of the Clariden Leu documents.
""The report to which you refer appears to be a confidential bank document. Mr Choudhrie has not broken any money-laundering rules in any of his business dealings at any stage.""
The lawyers said our questions about offset payments by Russian arms companies were too vague.
""You have not given the dates or amounts of the alleged payments or the basis on which you say they were 'suspicious' or made in relation to Russian arms deals. The business of Cottage Consultants was conducted in a lawful and proper manner.""

"In its latest report, Moneyval said the Vatican had improved its financial management and its bank had shut down almost 5,000 suspicious accounts.
Vatican prosecutors had frozen about â‚¬11m ($12m;Â£8m) and 29 money-laundering investigations had been launched.
However, the agency said there had yet to be any indictments or prosecutions.
It said there was ""a need now for the anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorist financing system to deliver effective results in terms of prosecutions, convictions and confiscation"".
Moneyval said ""the Holy See/Vatican City authorities should ensure that the gendarmerie and the prosecutor's office have the capacity to conduct proactive financial investigations"" in order that current probes could produce results.
The Vatican said it had nothing to add to earlier comments welcoming Moneyval's acknowledgement that improvements had been made.
Moneyval, which was making its third evaluation of the Vatican since 2012, said the Holy See should give an update by December 2017 on actions it had taken to implement the agency's latest recommendations.
Shortly after taking office, Pope Francis had said the Vatican's finances should be more transparent and its bank should operate in ""harmony"" with the mission of the Church.
Moneyval's latest report comes about 18 months after the Vatican said it was replacing the entire senior management team of its bank as part of reforms of the Catholic Church's central government.
It said the bank would also eventually give up its investment activities to focus on serving religious orders and charities.

"Protesters shouted ""resign"" and ""shame on you"" as Elizabeth Campbell was made council leader at a public meeting.
The councillor said she was ""deeply sorry"" for the ""grief and trauma"" caused by the blaze in west London.
The fractious meeting ended early after a female resident fell to the ground and was attended to by medics.
About 70 of the 255 people who survived the blaze attended the meeting after condemnation of the council's response.
At least 80 people are dead or missing after the tower block fire on 14 June.
The council has been accused of being slow to react on the ground and not doing enough to re-house Grenfell Tower residents.
Many people in the public gallery at Kensington Town Hall were calling for the Conservative group that runs the council to resign and for new elections.
It was the first cabinet meeting since the fire, after the council abandoned an earlier meeting - which had been planned as a closed one - when members of the press were allowed in after a High Court judgement.
Addressing survivors in the chamber, Ms Campbell said: ""I am truly sorry that we did not do more to help you when you needed it the most.""
Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims?
Former Grenfell Tower residents sat in the public gallery, while at least 150 community members and volunteers were in an overspill room.
One by one, residents and those who lost loved ones gave accounts of their traumatic experiences, voicing their distrust in local services.
One survivor, from the 16th floor of Grenfell Tower, who gave his name as Hamid, said he had ""had enough"".
""I need a place to go and start my life,"" he said. ""I'm not asking for something big.
""We need to move on. We want to go to work - kids got to go to school.""
Another survivor told the chamber he had been living in a hotel room since the fire, with just one double bed between him, his wife and three children.
He said that the residents' main problem was a lack of action.
""I was forgotten about,"" he added.
""You know who has done something for us? The residents of North Kensington. Our community. Our neighbours.""
As the meeting progressed, attention turned to a petition calling for the council's entire elected leadership to resign.
It was signed by more than 1,500 people, passing the threshold for a debate by councillors.
Labour's newly elected MP for Kensington, Emma Dent Coad, said: ""I agree entirely with the petition's demands.""
Ms Campbell, who was heckled again as she responded to the petition, said: ""We will not continue business as usual and we will rebuild trust, as I said, brick by brick.""
Earlier, she said 68 new homes for Grenfell Tower survivors would be identified and bought within the next two weeks, and an additional 31 homes would be acquired in the next few weeks.
The councillor also promised that 400 new social houses would be built over the next five years.
She took over as de facto leader after Nicholas Paget-Brown resigned on 30 June.
She later admitted on the Today programme that she had never been in a tower block, but added that she had visited many council houses.

But with one in eight young people still Neet, a leading training group described the fall as ""a tiny victory"".

""We have a long way to go to make sure that no-one is slipping through the cracks, especially given the slight rise in the Neet rate amongst 16- to 18-year-olds.

"An apparent link between alcohol abuse and suicidal behaviour was also identified.
In all, three studies into the suicide and alcohol abuse were commissioned by the Public Health Agency.
Key findings on suicide showed rates were higher in Belfast and other larger towns and cities.
Almost half of those who take their own lives in Northern Ireland have made a previous attempt or have had a history of suicidal thoughts, the research suggests.
When it comes to alcohol abuse, families often felt a stigma when trying to get help and GPs said time and a lack of coordination led to problems accessing services.

Those families experienced more separations and divorces. Their children were found to spend more time outside the home and felt less attachment to school.
The report also showed that children developed clear strategies to help them cope with their parents' drinking.
It stresses that schools and teachers should be more aware of these problems.
The three research studies were carried out by teams at the University of Ulster and Queen's University, Belfast.

"The 67-year-old is a former Ulster Unionist, who was at one time chief whip of that party.
He was first elected as an MLA for Strangford for the UUP in 2003 and subsequently re-elected in 2007 and again in 2011.
However, he left the Ulster Unionists - a party he first stood in an election for in 1982 - in acrimonious circumstances in 2012.
Mr McNarry resigned the UUP Stormont whip in January after the then party leader Tom Elliot demoted him from the deputy chair of the education committee.
He also resigned from the UUP's assembly group, but remained a party member.
The Strangford MLA's fall-out with Mr Elliot came after Mr McNarry gave an interview to the Belfast Telegraph detailing discussions between the UUP and DUP about unionist unity.
After Mike Nesbitt replaced Mr Elliot as party leader in March 2012, he said: ""I cannot imagine any circumstances under which David McNarry would be back in the Ulster Unionist assembly group of MLAs when I have control of the whip.""
Mr McNarry was subsequently expelled from the party in May 2012.
He continued to sit in the assembly as an independent, until he joined UKIP in October of that year, becoming the party's first MLA.
He became leader of the party in 2013.
He said Northern Ireland was ready for a voluntary coalition with an opposition, adding that the current set-up at Stormont had ""served its purpose and passed its sell-by date"".
In 2015, Mr McNarry said he had been working for 18 months on the launch of a new Loyalist Community Council, supported by the UDA, the UVF and the Red Hand Commando paramilitary groups, that would explore how the groups would eventually disband.
Later that year, UKIP expelled one of its most high profile figures in Northern Ireland. Henry Reilly was the party's Northern Ireland candidate in last year's European elections, receiving more than 24,000 votes.

Hodge duly brought Laughlin on to bowl and, even though he did not get Watson out, the incident ""disappointed"" CA.
Broadcaster Network Ten later apologised for Howard's comments.
Hodge was wearing a microphone and earpiece so he could speak to commentators in between overs as part of the broadcaster's live coverage.

"However, as the celebrity can still appeal to the Supreme Court he cannot be named - yet.
One of the grounds to lifting the reporting ban was that the allegations were now widespread.
This was due to publication of the story in Scotland and other countries. It was published north of the border as the injunction did not apply outside England and Wales.
As Scotland is a separate legal jurisdiction, foreign judgments, including those from England and Wales, require to be registered in Scotland to work.
However, a foreign judgment can only be registered in Scotland if it is a final order of the court.
Interim orders are issued during the course of an action for protective purposes until the court has the opportunity of hearing the case and making a final order.
The gagging order obtained by the celebrity was an interim injunction. It was not a final judgment and so could not be enforced in Scotland.
If the celebtrity had wanted to obtain protection in Scotland, the celebrity would have needed to go to the Scottish court seeking interim interdict (the Scottish term for an interim injunction). This could be done in two ways:
There is little practical difference between the two approaches.
If an interim interdict had been granted under either of those two options then it would have stopped the printed publication in Scotland and the Court of Appeal might have come to a different decision.
So, what's going to happen now? On Monday the court gave the man time to apply to take his case to the UK Supreme Court.
In the ruling, they said there must be no publication leading to disclosure of the celebrity's identity before 13:00 BST on Wednesday.
The celebrity - who has young children and whose spouse is also well-known - has until 10:00 BST on Tuesday to submit arguments to the Supreme Court.
It will then decide whether to hear the case - and therefore extend the reporting ban - or to throw it out, leading to the order being being lifted.",The Court of Appeal has held that the interim injunction banning the naming of a married celebrity who it is claimed participated in a threesome has been lifted.,36071568
"City hotelier Norman Springford revealed earlier this year he was willing to pay for the redevelopment of the 80-year-old venue in West Princes Street Gardens.
The benefactor teamed up with City of Edinburgh Council to form a steering group to develop the plans.
The wider proposals include landscaping the gardens.
Under the plans, the 140-year-old Ross Fountain would be refurbished and visitor facilities added to the gardens.
Councillors will discuss a report outlining the planned appointment of a Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation (SCIO) to front the proposed redevelopment.
If councillors approve the plans next week at a full council meeting, the proposals will then go to the Scottish government as the Ross Bandstand is on common ground.
The Ross Bandstand was developed as a venue in 1935 and has a capacity of 2,400.
The original facility dates back to 1877 and was gifted to Edinburgh by William Henry Ross, chairman of the Distillers Company Ltd.
Andrew Burns, City of Edinburgh Council's leader and convener of the corporate policy and strategy committee, said: ""While the Ross Bandstand remains a key venue for the city's famous festival fireworks and Hogmanay concert in the gardens, it is more than 80 years old and is nearing the end of its useful life.
""By working in partnership with a SCIO, we hope to be able to work towards the creation of a new facility as part of major renewal of the gardens.
""The area is Common Good land and we are well aware of the implications of building in public parks, so while there is still much work to be done, we are making a commitment to supporting and progressing plans.""
Richard Lewis, the city's culture convener, said: ""In the shadow of Edinburgh Castle, in the heart of West Princes Street Gardens, the Ross Bandstand boasts what must be one of the most recognisable backdrops on earth.
""We are making a considerable step by progressing redevelopment ideas for the site and I hope that by working with Mr Springford, we will be able to support an exciting design competition with the SCIO to see this incredible asset brought back into suitable use.""

"It is understood he may have been tortured before he was killed.
The 32-year-old, originally from Lithuania, was found dead at the property on the Moor Road, near Clonoe, shortly after 13:00 BST on Thursday.
Mr Stauskas had a violent past, having been jailed for five and a half years for the 2011 manslaughter of a fellow Lithuanian, Audrius Aukstuolis.
The two men had arranged to meet for what was effectively a duel in a busy car park in Dungannon, County Tyrone, and both were armed.
Mr Stauskas had a knife, while Mr Aukstuolis had a screwdriver, although he had apparently asked a workmate for a hammer just before the fight.
Only one blow was struck, by Mr Stauskas with the knife. It pierced Mr Aukstuolis' heart and killed him.
Mr Aukstuolis was a bodybuilder who had been charged with a very serious sexual assault and kidnapping.
The dispute between the two men began after Mr Stauskas' girlfriend was appointed as Mr Aukstuolis' interpreter as he faced those charges.
The bodybuilder allegedly became infatuated with the interpreter and continued to pursue the woman despite being rebuffed.
The 2012 manslaughter trial was told that Mr Aukstuolis wanted her boyfriend out of the way and made threats to kill Mr Stauskas.
The two men began sending each other abusive and threatening text messages, which escalated into a challenge to a fight with knives.
The murder of Mr Stauskas was not the only violent incident involving an eastern European in the County Tyrone area last week.
On Wednesday, a man in his 30s was beaten and shot not far from the shed where Mr Stauskas' body was found. His injuries are not understood to be life-threatening.
Police have said they are still working to establish definitively that there is a link between these two attacks.","A murder victim, whose body was found in a County Tyrone garage last week, has been named as Gediminas Stauskas.",34571099

The attack comes a day after at least 29 people were killed and dozens wounded in a series of bombings across the capital.
Sectarian violence has surged across Iraq in recent months, reaching its highest level since 2008.
The bomb went off at about midday (09:00 GMT) in a neighbourhood populated mostly by Shia Kurds, officials told the French news agency AFP.
Witnesses told police that the bomb was on board a truck of vegetables.
No group has claimed responsibility for the violence, but Sunni militants linked to al-Qaeda often carry out such attacks to undermine confidence in the Shia-led government.
Officials have voiced concern that the conflict in neighbouring Syria has emboldened these militant groups.
According to figures released by the UN at the beginning of this month, a total of 979 Iraqis were killed and another 1,902 were wounded in acts of terrorism and violence in October.

""In the last couple of weeks, I've played some really good golf in the Middle East for probably two-and-a-half to three rounds out of four,"" Drysdale told BBC Scotland.
""But I just haven't holed the putts I should have.""
Following the Abu Dhabi Championship and the Qatar Masters over the past fortnight, the 'desert swing' culminates in Dubai on Thursday and Drysdale is one of six Scots competing.
Drysdale, ranked 30th in the European Tour's Race to Dubai, finished joint-57th in Abu Dhabi and joint-37th in Qatar.
""Preparations are going well and I've been playing some decent stuff the last few weeks,"" said Drysdale.
""I've been working hard on every aspect of my game and it is improving.
""Consistency has not really been the issue. Ball striking has been good for a couple of years now and tee-to-green golf's been good, so I don't generally put myself in a lot of bother.
""I could always chip and putt the ball better, that's really the key, if I can have a decent putting week then I can have some good results.""

It is a par-72 track measuring 7,328 yards and was the first grass course in the Middle East.
England's Danny Willett holed a brilliant 15-yard putt on the 18th to take the 2016 Dubai Desert Classic title by one stroke on a total of 19 under par.
It was his fourth European Tour win and three months later the Yorkshireman would be wearing a green jacket after a Masters triumph.
The tournament has been running since 1989 and Scotland has a good history in the Dubai Desert Classic, with Colin Montgomerie victorious in 1996 and Linlithgow's Stephen Gallacher winning consecutive titles there in 2013 and 2014.
Yes. Six of them, including Drysdale and Gallacher.
In each of his first two events of 2017, East Kilbride's Marc Warren posted promising opening rounds of 66 and 69 but then struggled to follow those up with further sub-70 scores despite making the cut both times. But Dubai gives the 35-year-old the chance to rectify that.
Aberdeen's Richie Ramsay was joint top Scot in 37th with Drysdale at the Qatar Masters and the 33-year-old already has three European Tour titles to his name - most recently Morocco's Trophee Hassan II in 2015.
Eight-time winner on the European Tour - Aberdeen's Paul Lawrie - has missed the cut in the two previous desert swing events in 2017 so managing to remain in the field for Saturday and Sunday's play will be progress for him.

"The most polluted cities were in north-eastern Hebei, the province that surrounds the capital Beijing.
Beijing and Shanghai both failed the assessment, which was based on measurements of major pollutants.
China is attempting to cut pollution but the country still relies heavily on coal for its energy needs.
The government shut more than 8,000 coal-burning factories in Hebei last year.
But the BBC's Celia Hatton in Beijing says like many places in China, the authorities are struggling to balance factory closures with the demands of the country's slowing economy.
The environment ministry's statement published on its website  (in Chinese) noted that the 2014 result was an improvement over the previous year, where only three cities met the standards.
But it added that ""presently, the country's air pollution situation remains serious"".
The assessment was based on readings of pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone.
The southern city of Haikou, in Hainan province, was found to have the cleanest air.
Most of the eight cities that made the grade were in the east of the country.
Meanwhile the northern industrial city of Baoding had the dirtiest air.
The statement did not give the rankings for Beijing and Shanghai, although it noted that Beijing's air quality had improved slightly over the previous year.
The Chinese authorities announced a ""war on air pollution"" last year, and recently began publishing figures for the air quality in China's cities. Officials have pledged to restrict consumption of coal, scrap millions of cars and rely more on clean energy sources.
At November's Apec summit, China made a historic pledge that its carbon emissions would peak by 2030, but did not set a specific target.
It also attempted to improve the air quality in Beijing during the Apec summit, imposing tight limits on car use and ordering factories to close in the weeks leading up to the meeting.
The temporary improvement in air quality was termed ""Apec Blue"", and the government has since promised to make it a permanent feature by improving air quality countrywide.","Only eight out of China's 74 biggest cities passed the government's basic air quality standards in 2014, the environment ministry has said.",31110408

"Lynnette Wallace, 44, from Aspley, was 30 weeks into her pregnancy and said her ordeal led to a premature birth.
Nottinghamshire Police's Chief Constable, Chris Eyre, apologised and admitted after she was handcuffed for a second time it, ""amounted to assault"".
However, her claims have been ""strongly contested"" by the Police Federation.
Ms Wallace was arrested on suspicion of arson in 2011 - although subsequent charges were later dropped - and was taken into custody at Bridewell police station where she was assessed as being at a risk of self-harming.
She claimed she was handcuffed behind her back for 11 hours and stripped of all of her clothes above her waist, including her bra, by male officers.
She said was also denied the opportunity to arrange childcare for her children while in custody.
Later, when she was moved to another cell she said she was ""repeatedly punched"" on the upper arm after refusing to be handcuffed.
In a letter, Mr Eyre told Ms Wallace it was ""inexcusable the use of handcuffs was not reviewed"" and the ""re-application of handcuffs amounted to an assault"".
He added: ""I accept you were caused significant distress and an affront to your dignity. I wish to apologise for those failings.""
Ms Wallace said she was still ""angry"" over the events and claimed her now four-year-old daughter, Charna, had ongoing problems as a result of being born prematurely - 48 hours after her arrest.
""It was an awful experience to go through, the handcuffing, being stripped,"" she said.
""My daughter is still suffering. She has eyesight problems, an eating disorder and struggles with infections.""
In 2013, the force found an inspector and two sergeants guilty of ""gross misconduct"" for their part in Ms Wallace's treatment and they were disciplined.
In a statement, the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, said: ""Following a reinvestigation into the treatment of Lynnette Wallace while in custody of Nottinghamshire Police in July 2011, the IPCC has passed a file to the Crown Prosecution Service.
""We will look to publish the findings of our investigation at the conclusion of any legal action.""
Four PCs, two custody sergeants and two duty inspectors may face charges as a result.
However, Phill Matthews from the Police Federation said all of the officers ""deny any assault or wrongdoing"" when the handcuffs were re-applied on Ms Wallace.
He said: ""No officer has ever been criticised or been found wanting regarding any criminal or other type of assault to Ms Wallace.
""No medical or other evidence has ever been produced to show a link between her custody and the early birth of her daughter.""

Matthew's clash with Willstrop, 30, was a repeat of the 2010 final in Delhi.
Then Matthew had won in three games but this time he was made to work much harder as Willstrop pushed him every step of the way.
An exhausting rally on the third point of the match set the tone as both men covered the court in tireless fashion while producing some top quality squash.
World champion Matthew - who carried the England flag at the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony - took the opening game before Willstrop hit back.
Sheffield's Matthew, who won gold in both the singles and doubles in Delhi four years ago, went 2-1 ahead as he breezed through the third game but Willstrop hit back in impressive fashion in game four to take it to a decider.
But Matthew, who had won the last 24 meetings between the pair, went ahead early in the fifth game and maintained his advantage throughout to take it.
Matthew's victory was all the more impressive as his hopes of competing in Glasgow were threatened by a knee injury which required surgery last month and left his participation in doubt.

Like Matthew, it is back-to-back Commonwealth golds for David, who did not drop a single game when she won in Delhi in 2010.
She has been world number one for 99 months and has won the World Open title a record seven times.
But Massaro, 30, is the world number two and went into the Commonwealths full of confidence after winning both the World Open and British Open titles in 2013.
Massaro, based in Preston, began quickly and looked to be controlling the opening game, but David showed why she has been the dominant figure in women's squash for so long by fighting back to pinch it 12-10.
The second game was much more one-sided as David played some brilliant shots and displayed her trademark athleticism around the court to breeze through 11-2 with little trouble.
Massaro fought hard in the third - and required treatment after being accidentally caught in the face by David's racket - but it was not enough.

"But what does Germany owe Greece, if anything, and why?
The Nazi occupation of Greece from 1940-44 was among the most savage - around 250,000 people died, mostly from starvation.
Massacres include the one at Kalavryta where about 500 people were killed. At issue now is compensation for the killing of 218 civilians in Distomo in 1944. In 2000, the Greek Supreme Court ruled Germany should pay €28m (£19.7m; $30m) to the relatives of those killed, although the decision was not enforced, and the dispute effectively reached stalemate in international courts in the following years.
Justice Minister Nikos Paraskevopoulos has said he is ready to approve that ruling.
Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told parliament on Tuesday he had a duty to pursue reparations. He set the tone for his presidency early on by laying a wreath at a memorial to a massacre of Greeks by German soldiers in Athens.
But Greece's wartime enemy is now its major creditor.
Greek relations with Germany have deteriorated in recent years because of the financial crisis, with Germany one of the big contributors to the eurozone bailout that began in 2010.
The new leftist government argues austerity measures should be relaxed, a demand opposed by Germany. It negotiated a four-month extension to its €240bn (£170bn; $255bn) bailout last month after tense talks with creditors.
Berlin paid 115m Deutschmarks to Athens in 1960 in compensation. It was a fraction of the Greek demand but was made with the agreement there would be no more claims. Greece says the 1960 deal did not cover key demands, including payments for damaged infrastructure, war crimes and the return of a forced loan exacted from occupied Greece.
Germany insists the issue of compensation was settled in 1990 legally and politically before Germany reunified and has questioned why Greece did not negotiate when it entered the eurozone.
It is classified but based on previous estimations, Athens could be demanding as much as €162bn: €108bn for destroyed infrastructure and €54bn for the forced loan.
The Supreme Court ruling allowed for German-owned property to be seized as compensation though it was never acted on by then-Justice Minister Michalis Stathopoulos.

"The former Ibrox defender believes Rangers will go into the game in much better fettle than they did losing to Celtic in last season's League Cup.
""Now the club is unified, looking to set a benchmark for next season and get an idea of what they'll face next year.
""Because they will win the Championship this season,"" said Brown, 54.
Brown, who was with Rangers during their run of nine titles in a row from 1988 to 1997, feels the Ibrox side have improved considerably over the past year.
Premiership leaders Celtic, meanwhile, are bidding for a fifth straight top-flight title.
""Rangers have a new regime, a new board with guys who are interested in football,"" said Brown.
""At the time of the last game [last season's semi-final], fans were looking to oust the previous board and that affects players.
""Mark Warburton, the manager, has the fans right behind him.""
Brown feels it could be the team that stays calm under pressure that will win through to the Scottish Cup final.
""If you lose the head and get caught up in the moment, you'll lose the game,"" he said.
""It's the team with cool heads on the day, with the right commitment and who want it more who will win.
""Both squads have real quality. It's how you manage that and it is all down to confidence.
""Mark Warburton has the team passing the ball with good movement and the players know the system.

"After 15 years of nursing, sister Sarah Kuteh was sacked for gross misconduct in August 2016 because of her ""religious fervour"" resembling a ""Monty Python sketch"".
The Kent nurse, with eight complaints against her, said the dismissal was ""a hugely disproportionate punishment"".
But the tribunal sided with the trust.
The mother of three worked at Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford, Kent, from 2007 and said she had to ask patients about their faith, as part of all pre-operation questionnaires.
After a complaint, she was warned against imposing her own views on patients by the Dartford and Gravesham NHS Trust.
The complaints:
Victoria Leivers-Carruth, director of nursing and quality at the trust, chaired the trust's disciplinary appeal hearing in 2016.
She said Mrs Kuteh failed to follow management instructions and breached the Nursing and Midwifery Code.
Mrs Kuteh launched legal action in December, supported by the Christian Legal Centre, and in a statement at the time, she said: ""How could it ever be harmful to tell someone about Jesus?""
But a tribunal in Ashford ruled her unfair dismissal claim was ""not well founded"", there was no evidence her human rights had been breached and the trust's actions were fair.
A spokesman for the trust said: ""This case was never about religion. It related to professional nursing responsibilities, behaviour and conduct in a public-facing role and position of trust.""","A nurse was rightly dismissed for ""imposing"" her religious beliefs on patients, an employment tribunal has ruled.",39443613
"The hosts dominated the opening half an hour with Rob Hall, Carl Baker and Josh Murphy all shooting wide.
But it was Leeds who went ahead when Baker brought down Charlie Taylor with Chris Wood converting the penalty, before Taylor made it 2-0.
Samir Carruthers was shown a late red card for a tackle on Stuart Dallas after Simon Church had cut the lead.
Hall had the first notable chance for MK Dons when he smartly beat two Leeds defenders before striking off target.
Murphy, on loan from Norwich, then had two carbon-copy chances for the Dons when he cut inside from the left-wing and curled just wide when attempting to find the far corner of Marco Silvestri's net, before the Leeds goalkeeper denied the same player at the near post.
Karl Robinson's side then had their best chance to go ahead as Hall's shot was tipped onto the woodwork by Silverstri but Sam Gallagher somehow smashed the rebound over.
That miss was to prove costly as Leeds immediately went down the other end and won a penalty when Baker clumsily brought down Taylor and Wood sent David Martin the wrong way to score his fourth goal in six games.
Taylor's run and shot then doubled Leeds' advantage, before MK Dons saw their own appeals for a penalty for handball waved away by referee David Webb.
A low-key second half was sparked into life when Church converted the dangerous Murphy's cross for his first goal for the club.
Despite Carruthers' dismissal, it was the hosts who pushed for an equaliser at the end, but Leeds held firm for their second Championship win of the season.

"Police say Ljubisa Bogdanovic, a 60-year-old war veteran, murdered six men, six women and a two-year-old boy in a village near Belgrade.
He had been in a serious condition in hospital after trying to kill himself and his wife in the rampage on 9 April.
Bogdanovic fought with the Serb forces in the war in Croatia in 1991.
The shootings took place in several houses in Velika Ivanca, about 50km (30 miles) south-east of the capital Belgrade, at about 0500 local time (0300 GMT) on Tuesday.
Local residents said the gunman, armed with a 9mm handgun, went door-to-door shooting dead neighbours, some of whom were still asleep.
The victims are also believed to include his mother and son.

At the hearing District Judge Quentin Purdy said: ""You're free to go as far as this court is concerned.""

The traditional St Patrick's Day final was a closely contested affair held in difficult wet and windy conditions.
All the tries came in the first half, with Rhys O'Donnell and David McCann touching down for RBAI and James Hume kicking a conversion to make it 12-0.
Chris Larmour crossed for Methody, with Paul Kerr adding a second-half penalty.
Outside centre Hume, who scored all 13 points in Inst's success 12 months ago, skewed an early penalty effort wide of the posts.
O'Donnell darted over and stretched to score on the line in the 15th minute, Hume adding the extras with a well executed kick from a difficult angle near the touchline.
Seven minutes later, second row McCann rumbled over beside the posts after a driving maul, Hume scuffing his conversion attempt on this occasion.
The signs looked ominous for Methody at this point but Larmour completed a superb move along the back-line by diving over for a try in the corner to reduce his side's deficit to seven points.
The second half saw both sides reduced to 14 men in rapid succession for high tackles, Kerr first seeing yellow and then Hume being sent to the 'sin bin' for seven minutes for an infringement on Michael Lowry.
Larmour almost grabbed his second try of the game, but was tackled into touch by the corner flag before he could ground the ball.
RBAI captain and playmaker Lowry was then taken off injured, and while Methody pushed for a potential winning score, they could only muster Kerr's three-pointer to eat into their opponents' lead.
""The boys stuck at it well, they showed real effort and grit in the last 20 minutes, and the boys off the bench put in a great shift too. It's a real privilege to lead such a great bunch of guys,"" said RBAI skipper Lowry after the match.

"The figure was marginally higher than for the same month last year.
Corporation tax receipts fell by 2.1% and benefits payments rose 4.9%.
The figures make it more likely that the government will fail to achieve its aim of wiping out the structural budget deficit by 2015.
The borrowing figures differ depending on whether the temporary effects of one-off financial transactions are included or excluded.
The April 2012 net borrowing figures included two one-off transactions to the government - £28bn from the transfer of the Royal Mail Pension Plan and £2.3bn following the closure of the Special Liquidity Scheme.
The ONS says that for the period April to August 2012, public sector net borrowing, excluding financial interventions such as bail-outs to the banks, was £31bn, £17.4bn lower than in the same period last year.
By Stephanie FlandersEconomics editor
But if the effect of this Royal Mail and other transactions are stripped out, then public sector net borrowing for April to August 2012 actually increased 22% to £61.3bn, £12.9bn higher than in the same period last year.
The ONS also reported that public sector net borrowing for the fiscal year 2011/2012 was £119.3bn, £6.7bn lower than the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast of £126bn.
David Gauke, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, said: ""Today's figures show the government borrowed almost £7bn less last year than previously estimated.
""This is further evidence that we are dealing with our debts and getting the deficit down.""
By Hugh PymChief economics correspondent, BBC News
There was gloomy news and slightly less gloomy news for George Osborne in these borrowing figures.
Excluding the one-off benefits of the Royal Mail pension assets transfer, government borrowing was up nearly 22% in the financial year to date compared to the same period last year.
That is hard to explain for a chancellor who has made a priority of deficit reduction, though he can point to some disruption to tax revenues because of North Sea production problems.
The consolation for the Treasury in the figures was the reduction in the estimate of borrowing last year. The government was £119bn in the red instead of the £125bn previously thought.
But the markets and Mr Osborne will be looking ahead rather than back and wondering how much more debt the government will rack up before the end of this year.
But Labour Treasury spokesman Chris Leslie said: ""These figures show that the deficit is rising because the government's economic plan is failing.
""We have the highest ever borrowing for any August and borrowing is up by 22% so far this year compared to the same period last year.""
Chancellor George Osborne's aim to balance the government's books by 2015 is ""in tatters"", he added.
David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said: ""Unless present trends are reversed in the next few months, we now expect total borrowing in 2012/13 as a whole to exceed the total predicted by the OBR at the time of the Budget by more than £20bn.""
He said the situation was ""worrying"".
With public sector net debt standing at £1.04 trillion at the end of August 2012, equivalent to 66.1% of gross domestic product (GDP), the pressure on the Chancellor George Osborne remains intense.
But on Thursday night, the chancellor received some support from Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England.
In an interview with Channel 4 News, Sir Mervyn said it would be ""acceptable"" if the government missed its deficit reduction target, as long as this was the result of slower global economic growth.
However, the BCC's Mr Kern warned that ""if persistently weak growth causes borrowing to overshoot, the UK's credit rating may be endangered"".
He argued that public spending cuts should be supplemented with policies to boost growth, including infrastructure spending, support for business lending, and a reduction in National Insurance Contributions.","UK public sector net borrowing was £14.4bn in August, the Office for National Statistics has said, the biggest deficit for the month since records began.",19672660

"""They never said a single word regarding this,"" Mr Assad told NBC News, referring to conversations with President Vladimir Putin and officials.
He said ""only the Syrian people"" would decide ""when to come and when to go"".
The US, which accuses Syria's leader of responsibility for atrocities, says he must go as part of a political transition to end the conflict there.
Russia has given the Syrian government strong diplomatic and military backing in its fight against rebels, but Mr Putin has said only a political solution can resolve the conflict.
Mr Assad's comments came as US Secretary of State John Kerry prepared to fly to Moscow for fresh talks about Syria.
The Syrian leader said he was not concerned about the possibility of Washington and Moscow agreeing a deal that would involve him stepping down.
""Because their politics, I mean, the Russian politics, is not based on making deals. It's based on values,"" Mr Assad said.
He said it ""won't take more than a few months"" until he regained full control of Syria.
He said ""terrorism"" in Syria had been pushed back ""only when the Russians intervened"" while the US was ""not serious"" about tackling so-called Islamic State.
""We wanted to defeat those terrorists, while the United States wanted to manage those groups in order to topple the government in Syria,"" he said.
In other comments, Mr Assad said Sunday Times reporter Marie Colvin had been ""responsible"" for her own death, when covering the conflict in 2012.
""It's a war and she came illegally to Syria. She worked with the terrorists, and because she came illegally, she's been responsible of everything that befall on her,"" he said.
Colvin's family recently said they were suing the Syrian government in the US for wrongful death.
Relatives said they had evidence that she was murdered as part of a policy of deliberately killing journalists.

"Landowners carry out culls from August that they say are necessary to protect game, such as grouse, from disease.
Campaign group OneKind said about 40% of the hares killed were shot for sport while about 50% died as part of organised culls.
The Scottish government said numbers needed to be controlled but it would not tolerate large-scale culls.
In its report, OneKind highlights three culls that took place on grouse moors, including two carried out last year on the Balmoral Estate in Royal Deeside.
They also said that at least 25 Scottish game estates were currently offering the opportunity to shoot mountain hares for sport.
An independent review looking at the sustainability of grouse moor management, including mountain hare culling, is being established.
The campaigners estimate that there are between 175,000-500,000 mountain hares in Scotland. They are classified as a priority species by the Scottish Wildlife Trust, giving them an added importance for biodiversity.
OneKind director Harry Huyton said mountain hares were an iconic species in Scotland and should be protected.
He said: ""Our report shows that instead they are persecuted in enormous numbers for entertainment.
""This killing is unregulated, and there are no guarantees that it is not further driving the decline of these species or causing unacceptable suffering.
""Today, the day before the open season begins, OneKind is calling on the Scottish government to take urgent action and introduce a moratorium on large-scale hunts and culls before the season gets into full swing.""
Previously, groups including the Cairngorm National Park Authority have called for restraint over hare culling. However, landowners have consistently said that culls are only implemented when hare numbers are high.
A Scottish government spokesman said: ""We have been very clear that we will not tolerate large-scale culls of mountain hares, but we recognise that numbers need to be controlled in some specific circumstances.

"Daryl Louden, 26, from Edinburgh, had pleaded guilty previously to embezzling £134,177.46 from the branch in RS McColl's in Ferry Road between 1 January and 29 September 2016.
Louden had taken the money to feed his gambling habit.
Sentence had been deferred for background reports.
At Edinburgh Sheriff Court, sheriff Frank Crowe told Louden his breach of trust had been enormous.
His actions, he said, had been devastating for those who worked with him and trusted in him.
Sheriff Crowe had heard that Louden had been in line for promotion to area manager when he wrote to his superior officer, David Richardson, saying he no longer wanted promotion and wished to stay where he was.
Mr Richardson had been curious about this and carried out a spot check at the office.
It revealed about £135,000 was missing. When Mr Richardson confronted Louden, he admitted to having a gambling addiction, which he said had ruined his life.
Defence solicitor, Jennifer McEvinney, previously told Sheriff Crowe Louden had had on-line accounts with two or three betting companies and was gambling on football and horse racing.
He had taken out a loan and was trying to repay it by gambling. When he lost money, he began betting more and more to try and recoup his losses.
A letter from Mr Richardson was handed to Sheriff Crowe by Ms McEvinney, which, she said, made it clear that Louden's actions had been ""extremely out of character"" and Mr Richardson was concerned about Louden's mental health.
Her client, however, had ""turned the corner"". She suggested a sentence be imposed which would allow her client to make recompense for the offence, perhaps by performing unpaid work in the community.
Sheriff Crowe, however, stated Louden had to face up to what he had done.
It was public money and he had disappointed his area manager, colleagues and friends and wasted the money on gambling.
Only a prison sentence was appropriate.
He did, however, reduce a sentence of two years to 16 months and added: ""I will take steps to ensure you get proper support and help in prison and hope this will help you get on with the useful side of your life.""","A man who admitted embezzling more than £134,000 from an Edinburgh post office where he was the manager has been jailed for 16 months.",39653089

Mr Ponta's Social Democratic Party (PSD) will probably remain in the existing coalition government until parliamentary elections, which are not due until December 2016.

Balotelli shocked students at a college in Manchester when he walked in and asked to use the loo!
The Italian rocked up to Xaverian College last January.
He used the toilet before chatting to students in the canteen and then walked into the teachers' staff room!

Camouflage is meant to hide you, but it had the opposite effect with Balotelli!
He grabbed the headlines again when he covered his Â£160,000 white Bentley car in army camouflage.
So he likes his fancy hats, but Balotelli also enjoys a bit of magic!

"He won 48,152 votes, a 58.9% share, in the fifth round of voting after four other candidates had been eliminated.
Ex-minister Tessa Jowell, regarded as the frontrunner going into the contest, came second with 41.1% of the vote ahead of Diane Abbott in third place.
Mr Khan, the MP for Tooting, said he would seek to represent the whole of the city and make a ""real difference"".
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One, he said his top priority if elected would be tackle London's ""housing crisis"", ensuring ""genuinely affordable homes to rent and buy"".
Mr Khan said he would also focus on affordable public transport and confirmed he had changed his mind on the issue of a third runway at Heathrow Airport over air pollution fears, and would be campaigning against expansion.
A total of 87,884 legitimate votes were cast in the ballot, in which the other candidates were former ministers David Lammy and Gareth Thomas, veteran Labour MP Ms Abbott and transport expert Christian Wolmar.
Analysis by BBC London political editor Tim Donovan
As he now seeks a mandate from five million Londoners, his personal and political journey will be scrutinised like never before.
Sadiq Khan has a back-story that may appeal to people who've never cast a vote in their lives.
He grew up on a south London housing estate, one of eight children, his father a bus driver. His children went to the same primary school as him. The Tooting constituency he represented since 2005 is where he's lived all his life.
In the second decade of the 21st Century some might argue the fact he is Muslim should pass unremarked. But his accession to City Hall would, for many, be a powerful statement of the city's diversity.
Some worry it may have the potential for division, but Sadiq Khan has so far proved himself an inclusive campaigning force.

Mr Thomas was first to be eliminated, with his second preferences reallocated, followed by Mr Wolmar, Mr Lammy and Ms Abbott.
A breakdown of the vote revealed Baroness Jowell had won the most votes from Labour Party members in the first round, but among registered supporters - who paid Â£3 to be entitled to vote - she was third behind Mr Khan and Ms Abbott.
Mr Khan was also top among affiliated union members.
Commentators reacted by saying Mr Khan's victory, allied to the strong showing of Ms Abbott, increased the likelihood of Jeremy Corbyn being elected party leader on Saturday.
BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said he suspected even Mr Khan - who nominated Mr Corbyn to be Labour leader - would be surprised by scale of his victory, adding that the ""winds of change are sweeping though Labour"".
Mr Corbyn was among a series of senior party figures to congratulate Mr Khan saying, regardless of Saturday's result, he looked forward to working closely with him ""as we seek to reconnect everywhere for a better kind of politics"".
Mr Khan said he had been clear that while he had nominated Mr Corbyn, he would not be voting for him and had backed Andy Burnham in the leadership contest.

"Lord Bew warned the level of vitriol was now such that it could deter people from running for office.
Labour MP Diane Abbott said this week she had endured a torrent of ""mindless"" racist and sexist abuse.
MPs have blamed hard-left and far-right groups and the rise of social media.
During a parliamentary debate on Wednesday, MPs from all parties spoke about the harassment they and their staff had received both in person and online, including death threats, rape threats and anti-Semitic abuse.
Conservative MP Simon Hart said he had heard of candidates having swastikas painted on their offices, and that the ""hashtag Tory scum had become a regular feature of our lives"" on social media.
First-time candidate Emily Owen, who stood for Labour in Aberconwy in this year's general election, has also spoken out about the sexually explicit messages she received online.
""I started having messages come through and they quickly became very explicit, with people explaining what they wanted to do to me - with or without my consent - asking lots of questions, what I would do to get votes,"" the 22-year-old told BBC Breakfast.
Using strong and graphic language, Ms Abbott gave the debate examples of the offensive messages she and her staff had to endure every day, not just at election time, including people tweeting she should be hung.
Theresa May has asked Lord Bew, who chairs the Committee on Standards in Public Life, to look into what went on during the election campaign and whether existing laws need to be strengthened to protect candidates in future.
In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour, Lord Bew said there was a problem in public life that had not been seen before.
""We are in a bad moment and we have to respond to it,"" he said. ""We cannot afford to lose people of quality in our public life and we may be approaching a tipping point.""
Conservative MPs say Jeremy Corbyn has been too slow to condemn the actions of left-wing activists, including members of the Momentum pressure group, who they claim have been targeting them as well some Labour MPs. Momentum has denied any involvement whatsoever.
Lord Bew said it was ""absolutely clear"" that the Labour leadership believed there was no place for threats or fear in politics but that political leaders, as a whole, needed to be more outspoken on the issue.
""Above all, we do need leadership from Parliament itself on this point. We have reached a point where this is not a sermon. This has got to be said with some sharpness.""
The committee, he added, was ""in listening mode"" and would not rule out anything at this stage.
""It's perfectly obvious that the ways in which the culture of civility in this country has been eroded has come from a number of different sources.

"Sir Ben Ainslie is currently leading the bid to become first British success in the world's oldest sporting event.
When asked whether she would like to be involved in the future, Mills, who won Olympic gold in Rio, said: ""Definitely, it's an incredible event and something I have loved watching for many years.
""Along with the Olympics, it's the other pinnacle of our sport.
""I would love to be involved in some way in the future.""
There are no women in the crews of the six boats in the 2017 America's Cup and Leslie Egnot is the only woman to helm a boat in the event, skippering the all-female crewed Mighty Mary in 1995.
Mills accepts there would need to be a change to enable women to compete in future events with roles becoming more physically demanding.

""It's a really interesting discussion topic,"" said Mills.
""If you look at it in terms of the physicality now, there are four roles on that boat that mean there is absolutely no way genetically a woman could match a man, which you have to accept.
""But the rules of the boat could change a little bit and a few more roles in the crew become a little bit more specifically sailing skills-based. If physicality wasn't the dominant factor, then it could be an option.
""It's like all walks of life with equality and giving people a chance to prove themselves and breaking through that barrier.
""Hopefully in the future, we will get there.""
Four times Olympic champion Ainslie is leading the Great Britain charge in his Land Rover BAR boat as they continue their quest to become the first British crew to win the America's Cup which was first staged in 1851.
In his crew is Mills' fellow Welsh competitor Bleddyn Mon.

"Wales finished their first major tournament in 58 years at the semi-finials of the European Championships, losing 2-0 to Portugal on Wednesday.

"Dozens more towns and villages are due to be connected by 2016, as many firms say they are still missing out.
The Welsh government says it is on target to see fast internet available for 96% of premises under its £425m Superfast Cymru venture with BT.
In June 2014 superfast broadband was available in 58% of premises in Wales, compared to 78% across the UK.
Deputy Minister for Skills and Technology Julie James said: ""By the time the Superfast Cymru programme is completed in spring 2016, Wales will be one of the most highly connected countries in Europe.""
Ann Beynon, BT Director for Wales, said: ""This is big news for Wales as people will now know when work will start for every single telephone exchange in Wales.
""It's probably the biggest engineering programme Wales has seen in the last ten years with the potential to improve the lives of individuals, families and businesses across Wales.""
Broadband makes a major difference for businesses particularly those in rural areas.
It can mean more sales for some and helps farmers provide the information they need to file with government departments.
But many businesses say they are not benefiting from faster speeds.
Critics argue that converting telephone exchanges does not mean every firm will get faster broadband, as cabling from the exchanges to the premises will not necessarily support it.
Just under half of the spend - £205m - is coming from the Welsh and UK governments and European funds, with BT providing the rest.
Superfast Cymru is listing exactly where and when exchange work will take place. However, homes and businesses will still need to sign up with an internet service provider once the optical fibre network has reached their neighbourhood.
Communications regulator Ofcom reported in August that while Wales was catching up in the rollout of superfast broadband, the number of people signing up for it still lagged behind the rest of the UK.
Meanwhile, the Wales Audit Office is reviewing whether the project is delivering effective value for money.",Work upgrading every telephone exchange in Wales for superfast broadband will begin by September 2015.,29636319
"Kurdi's body washed up in Turkey after the boat carrying his family capsized.
The photograph of Ai Wewei recreating the boy's lifeless pose was taken on the Greek island of Lesbos, where the artist has set up a studio.
It is for an exhibition at the India Art Fair, the Washington Post reports.
The black and white image, taken by Rohit Chawla, shows the artist lying on pebbles on the beach, with his palms upturned in the same manner as Kurdi.
Ai and his team ""actively helped in staging this photograph for us,"" Mr Chawla, told the Post. ""I am sure it wasn't very comfortable to lie down on the pebbles like that. But the soft evening light fell on his face when he lay down,"" he said.
As well as being exhibited at the India Art Fair, the image will appear alongside an interview with the artist in India Today.
The image has divided opinion on Twitter, with many praising it as as ""powerful"" but some suggesting it was a ""weird"" move from the artist.
Earlier this month, Mr Ai opened a studio on Lesbos, saying he wants to raise consciousness about the plight of refugees through art.
The studio, staffed by his students from China and Germany, will produce several projects with themes related to the refugee crisis.
The island is one of the main arrival points for migrants and refugees hoping to enter the EU.
Mr Ai last week announced that he has closed his exhibition in Denmark in protest at the country's plans to confiscate asylum seekers' valuables to pay for their upkeep.

"Insurers have warned that car insurance premiums could ""soar"" due to a new government formula for calculating personal injury payments.
Mr Hammond met insurance bosses on Tuesday to discuss the issue.
In a joint statement with the industry, he said the system must be ""fair"" to claimants as well as other drivers.
""The government will progress urgently with a consultation on the framework for setting future rates, and bring forward any necessary legislation at an early stage,"" Mr Hammond said.
However, he did not commit to making changes to the formula before it comes into force next month.
Mr Hammond met chief executives and other senior executives from 15 major insurance firms, including Aviva, Direct Line and Admiral.
Ahead of the meeting, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) said it would urge the chancellor to block the new formula before it kicks in on 20 March.
The ABI said the ""crazy"" change could increase car insurance premiums for young drivers by up to Â£1,000 a year.
Insurance experts have predicted the new payout rate could also add Â£300 to premiums for drivers over the age of 65.
Accident victims are paid compensation in a single lump sum, which in serious cases is supposed to support them for the rest of their lives.
But someone who receives that lump sum can actually increase that amount by investing it, and getting a cash return.
So to be fair to insurance companies, the payout is reduced accordingly.
For the past 16 years the discount rate, as it is called, has been set at a typical rate of 2.5% - making the payout that much smaller.
Now the Ministry of Justice has decided to reduce the discount rate from 2.5% to minus 0.75%.
That will result in more money for the victim, but a higher cost for the insurer.
The change was ordered because the formula assumes the victim were to invest his or her money in government bonds.
By the time inflation is taken into account, real returns on such bonds have become negative.
The reaction of the insurance industry has been overwhelmingly negative, with some insurers saying that profits would be hit by hundreds of millions of pounds.
Aviva became the latest insurance firm to warn of a hit on Tuesday, saying the change would cost it Â£385m in profit.
However, lawyers who campaigned in favour of the change said it was ""long overdue"".
Accident victims who suffer long-term injuries are set to benefit as they will receive higher payouts under the new formula.
The Ministry of Justice said on Monday it would launch a consultation ""before Easter"" on how the system can be made fairer.
It said it would bring forward any necessary legislation ""at an early stage"".","Chancellor Philip Hammond has said the government would ""urgently"" consult on future changes to compensation rates for victims of car accidents.",39122756

Wales lost to England following a late try by Elliot Daly, with the defence caught out by a wide pass from Owen Farrell following a misdirected clearance kick by Jonathan Davies.
Edwards revealed the team had not stuck to their normal strategy after claiming possession from England with less than four minutes remaining and while leading 16-14.
""What happened was we broke our structure,"" he said.
""From an unstructured turnover where our backs actually turn the ball over we're supposed to go through two rucks to get our backs back on their feet and our kick chasers.
""We didn't do that. We passed it back to the kicker after one ruck which was a mistake. I don't think even Jonathan expected the ball which was probably one of the reasons the kick wasn't as accurate as it normally is.
""But everyone makes mistakes. And if one of us makes a mistake we all make a mistake together so it's not a matter of us and them it's a matter of we.

"Calling herself Amnesia, she had gone on the social network Ask.fm seeking sympathy after breaking up with a boyfriend, Italian media report.
""Kill yourself"", ""Nobody wants you"" and ""You are not normal"" were some of the anonymous replies she received.
She jumped to her death from a high-rise building on Sunday.
It is still unclear which factors chiefly drove her to take her life. Prosecutors in Padua have opened an investigation into the circumstances surrounding her death.
For some time she had been posting messages that suggested she might be suicidal. She appeared to have stopped posting about a week before she died.
The girl, whose real name was given as Nadia by Italian daily Il Mattino di Padova, left messages for her family in the town of Fontaniva, near Padua, but they were unable to reach her in time.
Micaela Campana, an MP for the Democratic Party in the country's coalition government, said: ""We can no longer read about young people who take their lives because of threats and psychological pressure.""
There have been calls in Italy to shut down Ask.fm, which was sharply criticised for its policy of allowing users to post comment anonymously after previous bullying-related deaths in the UK and US.
Ask.fm spokesperson Liva Biseniece told the BBC News website: ""We intend to co-operate fully with the Italian authorities regarding this tragic case.
""We note that suicide cases of young people are always a very complex overlap of social, economic and emotional aspects. We urge the media to provide space and time to establish what prompted this terrible event.""
In recent months, Nadia replied 1,148 times to questions online, Il Mattino di Padova reports.
It found a stream of insults and obscenities directed at the girl.
""Where do I see myself living five years from now?"" she wrote in one entry. ""Me living five years from now? Wow.""
At one point, Nadia posted photos of cuts she said she had made to her arms.
It appears she planned her death carefully, leaving five letters to family and friends.
On news of Nadia's death, her mother was treated in hospital for shock, Il Mattino di Padova reports.
""My daughter was only 14 years old and hadn't done anything,"" the girl's father was quoted as saying.
The mayor of Fontaniva, Marcello Mezzasalma, said Nadia's father had confided in him that he had secretly checked his daughter's mobile phone and diary, but had not noticed anything amiss.
The mayor said he had decided against declaring a day of mourning so as to avoid ""creating an even bigger clamour"".
Blaming the social network, Mr Mezzasalma said: ""Let's close this damn Ask.""
He added that he was in contact with Italian MEP Mara Bizzotto, a member of the opposition Northern League party, who has asked the European Commission for stronger EU legislation on internet abuse.

"The Children's Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, herself a Leeds-based mother, said parents in the south spur on their children.
The Commissioner's Growing up North research on children's prospects in the north will be launched on Tuesday.
A north-south attainment gap opens up in secondary school, says the study.
Some of the findings were positive for northern children - with better well-being at age 11 - and in some areas, for example the north-east, children doing very well, with 56% reaching the expected standard at 11, only slightly behind inner London on 57%, say the researchers.
However, the study found that by the time they become adults, a gap in attainment and outcomes emerges between children in London and the south-east and their counterparts in English counties north of an imaginary line drawn between the mouth of the river Mersey and the Wash.
Overall, the research finds little difference between the academic achievements of primary school children on either side of the divide - but this does not continue into secondary school, with a pronounced gap by 16.
Speaking to The Times newspaper ahead of the launch, Ms Longfield said: ""As northern parents, we need to be aware of these inconsistencies and variations in secondary schools and push hard for our schools to show how they are improving and helping our children to achieve.
""One of the real drivers of improvements of schools in London has been the demand for good school results from parents and children. There is much we northern parents can learn about this parent power.""
Ms Longfield told the newspaper that although the ""tiger"" parents of London and the south-east had been mocked for their emphasis on extra homework and music lessons, there was something to be learned from the way they demanded more from teachers and schools for their children.
Highlights of the research include:
The research heralds a Growing Up North project which will investigate why some children in the north fall behind.
At the launch of the project, the Commissioner is expected to call for the regeneration under way in the north of England to focus on reshaping the prospects of all children in the region to put them on a par with those in the south.
A north-south divide, particularly in secondary schools, was highlighted by Ofsted in its annual report on Thursday last week.
In the report, England's chief inspector of schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, said poorly performing schools in the north and the East Midlands continued to fuel the sense of a divided nation.","Parents in the north of England should learn from their pushier counterparts in the south to help their children get top grades, says the children's tsar.",38207685

"Many have been using the hashtag #Quanmianertai# - shorthand for ""Freeing up all aspects to have a second child"" - which has become a top trending topic on Thursday night and Friday on the Weibo microblogging network.
People have been sharing their own stories about how strictly the one-child policy had been enforced over the decades it has been in place.
""I can still remember when I was little, the family planning department broke down the door in my family home to grab my mum and sterilise her. I still carry this trauma to this day. What kind of methods would they use to make us have a second child?"" wrote user MuziD-AiLee.
Her post attracted scores of sympathetic responses recounting similar experiences.

""So I was forced to be sterilised - I was only 23 at that time. My heart hurt so much then - I'm so young and I can't have any more children. I hate the family planning unit.""
The hukou is China's identity registration system - officials often deny this to illegal children, making it difficult for them to travel around the country and gain access to state education and healthcare.

Others shared sympathy for young Chinese born after 1979, characterising them as the only generation without any siblings.

"Caroline Hope, who is from Clydebank, had been working as an English teacher in the country when she fell ill.
A private plane carrying the 37-year-old is due to land at Glasgow Airport.
Her family had feared she would not survive after contracting the bacteria and launched a JustGiving page to raise money for her return to Scotland.
That appeal raised more than £31,000 to pay for a private medical evacuation.
The fundraising appeal was in response to UK government guidelines that strictly limit the repatriation of UK citizens for medical reasons.
On arrival at the airport, Caroline Hope will be taken by ambulance to a hospital in the city before she is eventually moved to the Beatson cancer treatment centre.
Before being diagnosed with stage four colon cancer, Caroline Hope had been teaching English at an international school in Turkey.
She had planned to return to Scotland and her employer had taken out medical insurance to cover her stay at the Medical Park Hospital in Izmir until the end of July.
However, her recovery was undermined when she became infected with E.coli during an operation to remove a tumour last month.
Her mother, Catherine Hope, had been due to fly out to Turkey on Thursday but was told to stay in Scotland after the money needed to bring her daughter home was raised within hours of the appeal being launched.
Catherine Hope, who is waiting for her daughter's flight to arrive, said: ""She thought she was going to die. She wants home. She said she thought her body was giving up on her.
""But when she got on the plane, my son Scott sent me a picture of her, and she was smiling.""
Scott Hope, Caroline's brother, told the BBC that doctors in Turkey had been in contact with doctors at the Beatson cancer treatment centre in Glasgow and that they were expecting his sister to be admitted there once she returned to Scotland.
He added that any money raised above and beyond that required to get Ms Hope back home would be donated to the Beatson.
Writing on the JustGiving page, Caroline Hope's friend Bella Shek wrote: ""We've smashed our target, unbelievable!
""Thank you, Thank you, Thank you so much. We can now get Caroline home.
""On behalf of Caroline, her family and all her friends, the support from all of you and the general public, many of whom have never met Caroline before, has been truly overwhelming.""",A Scottish woman who contracted E.coli while undergoing treatment for cancer in a Turkish hospital is due to return to Glasgow.,40542104

"Implying that the Russian president knew about the hacks, Mr Obama said: ""Not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin.""
The president said he had warned Mr Putin of serious consequences at a summit in September.
A month later, the US accused Russia of meddling in its democratic process.
The president has promised a ""proportional"" response to the hacking of the Democratic Party and of emails belonging to defeated presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman.
He appeared to suggest that the US could go on the offensive with its own cyber muscle, stating: ""Whatever they do to us, we can potentially do to them.""
Mr Obama's comments came during his last news conference of the year.
The president did not criticise his successor, Republican Donald Trump, by name, but said some Republicans were failing to acknowledge the seriousness of Russia's involvement in the US election.
He also expressed bewilderment over GOP supporters who say they approve of Mr Putin, declaring: ""Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave.""
The president urged Mr Trump to back a bipartisan investigation into Russian cyber intrusions.
Earlier this week, Donald Trump poured scorn on US intelligence claims that Russian hackers helped swing the election in his favour, calling them ridiculous and politically-motivated.
He tweeted: ""Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory!""
CIA Director John Brennan told employees on 16 December that the FBI agrees with the CIA's conclusion that Russia's goal was to help Mr Trump win.
The Kremlin denies US claims that Russia hacked official emails, and has called them ""indecent"".
""They need to either stop talking about this or finally present some sort of proof,"" Mr Putin's spokesman said.
The Kremlin's response came as Mrs Clinton attributed her election defeat to Russian hacking for the first time.
She told party donors that President Putin had a ""personal beef"" against her for describing Russia's parliamentary elections five years ago as rigged.
She also cited the release of a letter by FBI director James Comey as having lost her close races in key states.
Mr Comey made headlines when he announced a new inquiry into Mrs Clinton's email server 11 days before the presidential election. The matter was dropped two days before Americans voted.
The FBI had previously concluded that Mrs Clinton had been ""extremely careless"" over her use of a private email server while secretary of state, but there were no grounds for any charges.
The New York Times said Mrs Clinton's comments were her first on the subject since widespread reports of the hacking surfaced before the election.
""Putin publicly blamed me for the outpouring of outrage by his own people, and that is the direct line between what he said back then and what he did in this election,"" Mrs Clinton said, quoted by the Times.
""This is not just an attack on me and my campaign, although that may have added fuel to it. This is an attack against our country. We are well beyond normal political concerns here. This is about the integrity of our democracy and the security of our nation.""

"The commission said many passengers who are dependent on bus services in local areas faced less frequent services and, in some cases, higher fares, than in areas where there was more competition.
The trade association for buses said there was ""room for improvement"".
The commission's report did not include London or Northern Ireland.
There are 1,245 bus companies in England, Scotland and Wales.
The commission said the five largest bus operators - Arriva, FirstGroup, Go-Ahead, National Express and Stagecoach - provided 69% of local bus services in the whole reference area.
""There are a large number of towns and cities where bus operators face limited competition and little prospect of significant change,"" said Jeremy Peat, chairman of the Local Buses Inquiry Group at the Competition Commission.
""In a market that was deregulated in anticipation of widespread competition that is clearly a problem and there are evident risks of disadvantages for passengers when there is little to keep local operators on their toes.""
He added that head-to-head rivalry could be unstable in the bus market, with such head-to-heads on particular routes resulting in short-lived ""bus wars"".
Simon Posner, chief executive of the Confederation of Passenger Transport, said: ""Importantly for our customers, the report confirms that even where there is a dominant operator, our fares are reasonable.
""However, there is always room for improvement and, while this is only a preliminary report, the industry looks forward to working with the commission to identify ways to improve services for passengers.""
The Competition Commission is now consulting on measures to open up more markets by tackling the factors that can hinder competition.
It is also seeking views on ""whether Local Transport Authorities should take measures to encourage competition, including whether franchising (where operators would compete for the right to provide services) might be required in cases where there has been a particularly marked failure of competition"".","The UK bus market needs to be opened up to new firms as too many operators face little competition, the Competition Commission has said.",13306825
"Haydn Erasmus played a key role when Treorchy Male Choir reformed in Rhondda after World War II in 1946.
John Cynan Jones, an old friend and former conductor of the choir, said Mr Erasmus had three passions in his life - his family, his choir and the boys' club movement.
The choir said it was deeply saddened by the news.
""He was the last remaining member of the pre-war choir. An absolute pillar of the choir for seven decades,"" Mr Jones told BBC Radio Wales.
More recently he was known as the ""elder statesman"" of Treorchy.
""He was a great man, and I don't use that term lightly,"" said Mr Jones.
""He had three great passions in his life - his family, his choir and the boys' club movement harnessing outstanding talents especially on the soccer field.""
Mr Erasmus began his working career in the coal industry, but then moved to work at the EMI factory in Treorchy.
As a result of his work there he received the BEM (British Empire Medal for services to industry).
He sang with the original pre-war choir before it was disbanded, and when it was reformed in 1946 he was one of the reforming members.
""Choirs are the lifeblood of the Rhondda valleys. It was part of our social set-up,"" said Mr Jones.
""We had this wonderful influx of young men coming back from the forces, looking for something to do, and Haydn was instrumental in getting them together under Mr John Haydn Davies.
As a singer Mr Erasmus was outstanding, he added.
""Haydn had a particularly rich baritone voice which had a special unique quality which helped to blend together the other members in the group.""
The choir said in a statement: ""During his lengthy membership he witnessed the choir's unparalleled competition success at the National Eisteddfod, appeared in over 1,500 concerts, recordings and broadcasts, royal performances and tours to Switzerland, Strasbourg, China and Australia.
""Haydn rarely missed a concert and was a stalwart member of his section, becoming a dependable, conscientious mentor to many new choristers.""

"The advice from the World Health Organization (WHO) should reduce treatment to around nine months.
Currently, it can take as long as two years - and many patients fail to complete what can be a burdensome course.
Doctors urged countries to implement the guidelines quickly.
Conventional treatment can involve thousands of pills and daily injections. Deafness is one of the main side-effects.
Cure rates are as low as 50% because patients abandon treatment, leading to further problems with resistance.
The WHO is also recommending a faster test for MDR-TB, which gives results within two days - compared with the current three months.
It hailed the guidelines as a ""critical step forward"". Around 5% of TB cases are thought to have resistance to the two most effective drugs.
This translates into 480,000 cases worldwide - and 190,000 deaths from this form of TB every year. Many patients are not being identified.
The shorter treatment plan costs less than $1,000 per patient - compared with conventional treatment which costs $2,400 for the medicines alone.
The International Union against TB and Lung Disease and Medecins Sans Frontieres have been involved in trials of the new treatment method in Bangladesh and nine African countries, which have influenced the WHO's decision.
The Union hailed today's advice as ""an historic moment"".
Its senior vice president, Dr I D Rusen, told me: ""When we first saw evidence about the shorter regimen, back in 2007, it was almost too good to be true.
""Then further results which were consistent were presented at our conference late last year. Next year we'll have more evidence from a head-to-head trial comparing the two treatment methods.
""The shorter treatment plan uses different doses of existing drugs which were previously used for leprosy.
""So we hope there will be time for production to scale up, while countries get systems in place for the new guidelines, although it's possible there could be some supply issues.""
David Lister, an MSF TB Doctor working in Uzbekistan, co-ordinated one of the studies and described the huge difference it made.
He said: ""The prospect of two years of TB treatment drives parents to hide their children from treatment, teenagers to abandon their ambitions and adults to decide between providing for their family or getting healthy.
""The fear of relentless suffering due to side-effects manages to outweigh any hopes of cure and returning to a normal life.

"However, he describes it as the ""mission"" of Rangers, the team he managed to a domestic treble in season 2002-03, to halt champions Celtic.
""I see the Dons being second,"" the 58-year-old told BBC Radio Scotland.
""Derek McInnes has made good acquisitions and it is there for Rangers to try to usurp him.""
McLeish, who also enjoyed success in charge of Motherwell and Hibernian, joked that Rangers fans would be ""ganging up"" on him for tipping the club for whom he played in central defence almost 700 times.
But, as Celtic target a seventh consecutive title, the former Scotland manager thinks the Reds have the edge over Pedro Caixinha's Rangers team when it comes to being runners-up.
He is impressed with the standard of players to have arrived at Pittodrie over the summer, such as Kari Arnason, Greg Tansey, Ryan Christie, Stevie May, Greg Stewart, Nicky Maynard and Gary Mackay-Steven.
McLeish continued: ""I still think Aberdeen are the favourites. They still have a really good chance of finishing second.
""Derek McInnes has bought wisely again. If you look at the guys he's recruited, there is good experience there. Stevie May - what a buy that is.
""Being first, that's the only thing that Rangers fans crave but common sense would tell you that they should be accepting second.
""People talk about 'let's stop 10 in a row'. They've got to stop seven in a row. That is their mission this season.
""I've said Aberdeen could finish above them but Rangers have still got to pull out all the stops to try to beat Celtic this season.""
McLeish describes the treble-winning Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers as an ""all-round terrific package"", with a successful blend of man-management and coaching skills.
""Brendan came to Birmingham when he was out of work,"" he recalled. ""I invited him in for a day's training.
""I knew he was an educated guy. I think he learned a lot about man-management over maybe a sacking or two and going on to manage players like Steven Gerrard (at Liverpool) and doing it with great aplomb.""
McLeish was Scotland manager in 2007 before leaving for Birmingham City. He is urging the Tartan Army to get behind the current boss Gordon Strachan for September's World Cup qualifiers against Lithuania and Malta, insisting Scotland can win both games.
Asked if he would welcome a return to the Scotland job one day, he replied: ""Yeah, I would, absolutely. You kind of evolve in your life and there comes a moment when you think 'that would really suit me'.

"A late drop goal from Tiernan O'Halloran broke the deadlock in a tight contest on 77 minutes.
Craig Ronaldson then hammered over a long range penalty to seal the victory.
Blues had led at half-time 13-7 but at one stage were in front 13-0, with Gareth Anscombe scoring two penalties and converting Nick Williams' try.
Williams' try owed a debt to centre Willis Halaholo, who had only started in that position following the late withdrawal of Steve Shingler. Halaholo powered his way past several Connacht defenders, before Williams completed the score.

However, the visitors showed resolve to get back into things and created a fine opening for Matt Healy to go over the gain line, with JP Cooney adding a tough conversion.

"Last month, George Osborne announced plans he said would lead to an above-inflation rise in care budgets.
But council chiefs, NHS managers and care bosses have cast doubt on those claims in a letter to the chancellor.
It warns his plans would leave a funding gap and put vulnerable people at risk - denied by the government.
Care services, including care homes and services that provide help in people's home for tasks such as washing and dressing, are overseen by local councils.
Only the poorest get help - those with assets of over £23,250 have to pay the full cost of their care.
Over the past few years, the numbers getting help have fallen as councils have struggled to cope with cuts to their budgets.
But in last month's spending review, Mr Osborne said he was protecting social care budgets by allowing local authorities to raise council tax by 2% and increasing the amount of money available for the Better Care Fund, a joint pot of money used by councils and the NHS to support care services.
He said this - coupled with other changes - would mean care budgets would rise, adding the NHS could not ""function effectively without good social care"".
But now those involved in providing care services are questioning those claims.
The letter - signed by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, the Care Provider Alliance, which represents agencies providing care, and the NHS Confederation - is effectively the sector's response to the plans.
It points out that the amount of money council tax brings in varies greatly, with local authorities in poorer areas worse off.
Meanwhile, the extra £1.5bn of Better Care Fund money, which is on top of the £5.3bn currently being invested, will not kick-in until 2019.
On top of this, local government is seeing two of its main funding streams - the income it gets from the central government grant and business rates - fall by 24% in real terms this Parliament, the Local Government Association says.
Together these account for about a third of council funding.
Ray James, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, said the result was that councils would struggle to maintain care spending at its current level, never mind increase it.
""Councils have tried to prioritise funding for social care ahead of other services. But its ability to do that seems to have come to an end, so I think we will struggle to put much more into social care,"" he said.
""If that happens, services will be put at risk. We have an ageing population which is increasing demand and have to cope with the introduction of National Living Wage.
""Without action, we will see care homes close and vulnerable people not getting care.""
But a spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said councils had enough for care services.
He said the Better Care Fund money coupled with the council tax precept meant there would be another £3.5bn a year in the system by the end of the Parliament.
He added this package should ""ensure councils can support older and vulnerable people in their area"".

""I really wanted to do it,"" he revealed during filming for his new TV show. ""I would have got right into it as well.""
However, he went on, he was unable to accept due to work commitments.

Angelina Jolie's Unbroken and Into the Woods came second and third, based on their Friday to Sunday takings.
Their four-day takings, though, would have put them ahead of the Hobbit film.

"The privately-run facility will be next to a new Royal College of Physicians site in the Knowledge Quarter in Paddington near Liverpool city centre.
The Rutherford Cancer Centre North West could treat up to 700 patient a year, including NHS ones, from 2018.
NHS proton beam units are being built in Manchester and London to open in 2018 and 2019 respectively.
Proton beam therapy
It uses charged particles instead of X-rays to deliver radiotherapy for cancer patients.
The treatment allows high-energy protons to be targeted directly at a tumour, reducing the dose to surrounding tissues and organs.
In general, it gives fewer side effects compared with high-energy X-ray treatments.
It can be used to treat spinal cord tumours, sarcomas near the spine or brain, prostate cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer and some children's cancers.

"It's a region dominated by Labour - and that's unlikely to change.
The party's dominance in some seats is likely to be boosted further by the declining fortunes of the Liberal Democrats.
While Nick Clegg's party was pushing Labour hard in the City of Durham and the Newcastle seats last time, their ambitions are more limited in 2015.
They do have three seats to defend though. Westmorland and Lonsdale looks safe for potential future leader Tim Farron.
But there's far less certainty about the results in Redcar and Berwick.
Redcar was a gain in 2010, but Labour had never lost the seat before and despite some ructions in the local party, they'll feel they can take it back. The retirement of the victorious Ian Swales won't help the Lib Dems there.
But it's the Conservatives who are challenging in Berwick. Sir Alan Beith has held the seat as a Liberal and Liberal Democrat for 42 years, but his decision to stand down has made it more vulnerable.
The Conservatives though face their own struggles. Their 2010 gains in Stockton South (majority 332) and Carlisle (majority 854) are top Labour targets.
They need to retain both to be confident of keeping Ed Miliband out of 10 Downing Street.
But to have a chance of forming a majority Conservative government they may also need to win Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland from Labour. It is number 20 on their target list.
Gain all of those and in theory Middlesbrough South would be the victory that could give David Cameron the 326 seats he needs to have a parliamentary majority.
But of course it's not just about three parties any more.
UKIP have become strong challengers across the North East and Cumbria - finishing second to Labour in two parliamentary by-elections and the European elections.
Their biggest push is in Labour-held Hartlepool, as they have had some local success there, but they will also hope to take second place in a string of seats. Becoming the main regional opposition to Labour in 2020 is their main aim.
The Green Party will also hope to poll much more strongly than in 2010, and have 22 candidates in the North East alone.
And the region even has its own political party this time with the North East Party standing in four constituencies. They are campaigning for regional power - and in time hope to become the North's equivalent of the SNP.
Not too many of the MPs elected in the North East and Cumbria in 2015 are likely to look like the ranks of men in our computer graphics! There are likely to more women than ever this time - including potentially the first from Cumbria.

"Beyond a restatement of the commitment to an extra £8 billion in 2020, the Chancellor's Budget is likely to focus on welfare spending rather than the protected departments like health.
But, for what will be one of the most important domestic policy decisions made by this Government, detailed analysis of the financial needs of the NHS in England is underway.
Department of Health and Treasury officials are poring over projections for health demand. They need to be sure that the £8 billion identified by NHS chiefs is realistic. That figure was reached after assuming highly ambitious efficiency savings of £22 billion by 2020. Ministers want to be assured that figure is achievable.
The last thing the Government wants is to announce a spending review with plans for the NHS over this parliament, only for the service to demand more investment as the election gets closer. The word from Whitehall, and indeed NHS England, is that the much-repeated £8 billion and £22 billion were broad, initial estimates. A fair amount of stress-testing and re-appraisal of the numbers is now taking place.
As work on the spending review progresses, covering the next few years, the debate on NHS finances this year is intensifying.
There is always scepticism in Whitehall when hospital trust leaders call for more cash. This early in the financial year, the Chancellor is hardly likely to heed the siren voices warning of another looming deficit. But those voices are becoming louder.
Last week the Kings Fund think tank warned that financial problems were now ""endemic"" with even the best-run hospitals forecasting deficits this year. The Fund has added its voice to those predicting that NHS providers could slip further into the red. This followed hard on the heels of the Healthcare Financial Management Association talking of a ""bleak financial outlook"" with nearly four-fifths of trust finance directors expecting to be in a worse position at the end of this year than last.
The Government line is that hospitals and other health trusts should strive for the most efficient use of resources and that there is no scope for another injection of cash this year, especially when other departments are being squeezed so hard.  But the response of NHS insiders is that long-term productivity improvements will take time and there is a serious danger that the allocated budget ceiling will be breached because of inexorably rising patient demand.
It's a familiar argument - does the NHS need more money or should it become more efficient with its budget?
The latest figures from the OECD club of advanced economies provide new perspective in this debate. In 2013, the latest year for which comparable data is available, the UK's total health spending (public and private) as a proportion of national income of 8.5% was below the OECD average of 8.9%.
The OECD figures show the UK below Greece and Portugal for health spending on this basis, though the latter two spend more on private healthcare and rather less on public provision. The Government-funded proportion of total healthcare in the UK is one of the highest in the OECD.
The data from the OECD provide ammunition to those who argue for higher public spending on health in the UK.  But at a time of austerity in Whitehall, such a demand seems unlikely to gain much traction.
Getting the right balance between the requirements of the health service in the face of a rising population with more complex needs and the need to keep a tight rein on spending may cause a few sleepless nights for ministers between now and the autumn.",The big decisions on financing the NHS over the next few years are likely to come in the autumn with the departmental spending review.,33435910

During the talk, on a panel which included MP Chuka Umunna, he said: ""I see talk that we should become the party of the 48% - that is nonsense.

"Aruna Shanbaug was left with severe brain damage and paralysed after the 1973 attack by a ward attendant in the Mumbai hospital where she worked.
She was fed through the nose to keep her alive but developed pneumonia six days ago, the hospital told the BBC.
Her case sparked a debate about India's euthanasia laws. The Supreme Court had rejected a plea to allow her to die.
""Ms Shanbaug died at 08:30am on Monday. She was admitted to the intensive care unit and put on ventilator support,"" a spokesman at Mumbai's KEM hospital said.
The nurse was 25 years old when she was sodomised by a KEM hospital cleaner who strangled her with metal chains and left her to die on 27 November 1973.
She survived, but spent the rest of her life in hospital, force fed twice a day.
""My broken, battered baby bird finally flew away. And she gave India a passive euthanasia law before doing so,"" journalist and author Pinki Virani, who wrote Aruna's Story, a book on the nurse's plight, told the BBC.
There is an outpouring of sympathy for Aruna Shanbaug on Twitter.  Many feel that she ""should have been allowed to go much earlier"". Most Twitter users also agree that the absence of the ""right to die"" in India's legal system compounded her misery.
One Twitter user says Shanbaug's case ""represents everything that is wrong with India's society"".
Others highlight that she was brutally raped and then had to live in a vegetative state for 42 years because several campaigns in support of euthanasia ""just fell on deaf ears"".
Some say that her ordeal ""will always shame India"", while others are hopeful that her story will once again reignite the debate on euthanasia.
""Have mostly been ambivalent about euthanasia. But Aruna Shanbaug's case makes me want to take a stand. Misery should not last four decades,"" this tweet very much sums up the impact her story is likely to have on India's thinking on ""right to die"".
Ms Virani filed the case which was rejected by the Supreme Court in 2011. She had argued that Ms Shanbaug was ""virtually a dead person"" and should be allowed to die.
Ms Shanbaug's parents died many years ago and other relatives had not maintained contact with her, Ms Virani said.
She wanted the court to issue instructions to the hospital to stop feeding Ms Shanbaug.
But hospital authorities told the court that Ms Shanbaug ""accepts food... and responds by facial expressions"" and responds to ""commands intermittently by making sounds"".
Although the Supreme Court rejected Ms Virani's plea, the case resulted in India easing some restrictions on euthanasia after the court's landmark ruling that life support could be legally removed for some terminally ill patients in exceptional circumstances, providing the request was from family and supervised by doctors and the courts.
Doctors say patients in a vegetative state are awake, not in a coma, but have no awareness because of severe brain damage.
Lawyer Shekhar Nafade, who represented Ms Virani in the Supreme Court, told the BBC that he felt ""relieved for Aruna"".
Ms Shanbaug's attacker, Sohanlal Bharta Walmiki, was not even charged for raping her since sodomy was not considered rape under Indian laws at the time.
He was freed after serving a seven-year-sentence for robbery and attempted murder.
Ms Virani told the BBC in 2013 that she had tried hard to track him down, but with no success.

"Illona Cash launched Ambi with her partner Bowen Revill from their Sheffield home and started taking online orders two months ago.
She said she tried exercise to change her shape but realised she should design clothes to fit it instead.
The dresses she designs are a size smaller on the top than the bottom.

""I worked out solidly for a year and just found myself going from an 8 and a 10 to a 6 and an 8,"" she said.
""I was like that's it, that's my body shape I just have to dress for it now.
""You are trained to think everyone will fit into one particular size, and it wasn't until I realised I wasn't fitting a certain size that the idea came to me.""
She added: ""I don't think everyone fits into the same mould that shop sizes give us.""
Body shape is influenced by genes, with  DNA proven to influence where fat is stored.
Women said to be 'pear-shaped' have a smaller bust and waist and larger hips and thighs.
The capsule range of tailored workwear was launched and there are already plans for a second collection, possibly catering for women with a larger top half than bottom.
Mr Revill said there was already plenty of demand.
""The ones that don't need it, their immediate reaction is, do you do that the other way around?,"" she said.
""So even if it's someone who isn't of that body shape, you obviously spark an idea in them that actually, I don't have to make do with standard shapes that are out there.""
Jane Chapman, from True Colours Image Consultancy in Sheffield, welcomed the shift in how the clothes are sized.
She said: ""I think it's a great idea, anything that helps us get away from the one size fits all is a really good thing.
""The truth is that the majority of British women take a larger size below than they do above, and it is a particular problem finding fitted workwear that does that.""",A fashion designer has begun making mixed-size clothes for women after struggling to find anything to fit her pear-shaped figure.,40959723
"Sten Zvorwadza, who hopes to become the next Movement for Democratic Change MP for the city's Mbare suburb, was punched as he tried to put up posters.
He escaped uninjured and says the youths were almost certainly Zanu-PF supporters of President Robert Mugabe.
Both Zanu-PF and MDC are campaigning for a ""Yes"" vote in the referendum.
But the referendum campaign has been raising political tensions ahead of an election expected later in the year.
The parties have been in a coalition government for the last four years following a disputed vote in 2008 marred by violence.
The BBC's Andrew Harding witnessed the incident in Mbare - an MDC stronghold in Harare - and said the youths also threw punches at him and his film crew.

Although no-one was seriously injured, the incident is a reminder of the violence lurking close to the surface in Zimbabwe, he says.
Under the new constitution, the president who wins the election, expected to be held in July, will be able to serve a maximum of two terms.
Mr Mugabe and MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who is currently serving as prime minister, are both expected to vie for the presidency again.
Mr Mugabe, 89, has been in power since independence in 1980.
On Wednesday, he expressed concern over reports of a resurgence in political violence across the country.
His comments came after a Zanu-PF official was injured on Tuesday after his house was petrol-bombed by unknown assailants in Makoni district, in north-eastern Zimbabwe.
In February, the 12-year-old son of an MDC activist died in an alleged arson attack in the eastern farming district of Headlands.
Zanu-PF spokesman Rugare Gumbo said the president wanted people to vote peacefully.
""He said we should not have violence and added that the party will not tolerate that nonsense whether it is intra-party or inter-party. He wants the people to vote in peace,"" Zimbabwe's state-run Herald newspaper quotes Mr Gumbo as saying.
Analysts say the constitution is seen as a compromise document.
During campaigning the MDC has focussed on clauses guaranteeing protection against all forms of violence, and free and fair voting.
The MDC's Tendai Biti, who currently serves as finance minister, told the BBC the document was the ""midwife"" to a brand new Zimbabwe as it sets out people's rights, devolves some power and sets up a system of check and balances for those in authority.
The Zanu-PF campaign has highlighted the irreversibility of the land reform programme, which saw some 4,500 farms seized from mainly white commercial farmers, and other moves intended to give more economic power to black Zimbabweans.
Western and US observers have been barred from the referendum, but some 2,000 local and other foreign observers have been accredited for Saturday's vote, the Herald reports.
The Zimbabwe Election Support Network (Zesn), a network of 31 non-government organisations whose head office was raided by police in February, is deploying about 600 observers.
It said in a statement on Friday that it was worried about new regulations from the electoral commission limiting the number of observers at polling stations.
It was also concerned by the refusal to accredit Jestina Mukoko, director of the Zimbabwe Peace Project, Zesn said.
Ms Mukoko spent two days in police custody earlier this month being questioned on allegations of illegally distributing radios.
Over the last four months, several hundred shortwave radios have been confiscated by the authorities, who say that have been illegally donated by Western organisations.
Many people in rural areas get most of their news from radio, which is dominated by the state broadcaster, although several stations based abroad broadcast to Zimbabwe on shortwave.","A Zimbabwean politician has been attacked in the capital, Harare, during the last day of campaigning before a referendum on a new constitution.",21801651
"Officers are appealing for people who might have seen him carrying the blue suitcase between 18 and 22 May.
The BBC has also obtained CCTV footage which appears to show Abedi in a shop the day before the bombing, which killed 22 people.
Police are searching a landfill site on the outskirts of Bury, Greater Manchester.
The 22-year-old visited the Wilmslow Road area of Manchester and the city centre with the suitcase, police said.
Det Ch Supt Russ Jackson, from the North West Counter Terrorism Unit, said: ""I want to stress that this is a different item than the one he used in the attack.
""We have no reason to believe the case and its contents contain anything dangerous, but would ask people to be cautious.""
He added: ""The public should not approach the case if they see it but contact police immediately on 999.""
New CCTV footage has also emerged which appears to show Abedi shopping at a convenience store.
The footage was recorded in a store close to the flat where the suicide bomber was just hours before the attack.
The BBC has passed the footage to investigating officers.
Greater Manchester Police have asked anyone with information to contact the Anti-Terrorist Hotline in confidence on 0800 789 321.
Officers have been searching a landfill site in Pilsworth near Bury.
Footage of the search shows investigators in white boiler suits and blue helmets raking through the debris near a large red tent.
Earlier, there were searches in Whalley Range, Manchester and in Chester and Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, where a 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences.
Officers are also currently searching an address in the Rusholme area of Manchester.
In all, 14 men are now being questioned in connection with the investigation into the attack.
Meanwhile, Manchester City Council has announced there will be a vigil in St Ann's Square on Monday just after 22:30 BST - exactly one week after the attack took place.
Manchester Victoria station will also reopen on Tuesday, British Transport Police have said.
The station, which is connected to Manchester Arena where the bomb went off, suffered structural damage in the incident.
NHS England said 52 people injured in the attack were still being treated in hospital - including 19 in critical care.
Abedi detonated a bomb on 22 May at the end of a concert by US singer Ariana Grande.
MI5 said it would hold an inquiry into the way it dealt with warnings from the public that he was a potential threat.
The security service, which was alerted to his extremist views three times prior to last Monday's attack, will examine how it dealt with the warnings.
Home Secretary Amber Rudd said it was right for MI5 to review its processes.
MI5 has launched a ""post incident investigation"" into how the Manchester bomber was overlooked, while a separate report is being prepared for ministers and those who oversee the work of the service.
A Whitehall official said previously that Abedi was one of a ""pool"" of former subjects of interest whose risk remained ""subject to review"" by the security service and its partners.
Born in Manchester to Libyan parents, BBC Newsnight reported that when Abedi was 16 he fought against the Colonel Gaddafi regime with his father during the school holidays.
It was while at Manchester College that two people who knew Abedi have confirmed they made separate calls to an anti-terrorism hotline to warn the police about his extremist views.

"This will allow the 28-member bloc to increase economic co-operation and aid with the communist-run island.
The move comes some eight months after Cuba and the US restored diplomatic ties following a 54-year freeze.
Barack Obama is set to become the first sitting US president to visit Havana for nearly 90 years when he goes there later this month.
The signing in the capital was the culmination of quiet discussions taking place in the background while attention was focussed on Cuba's new ties with Washington.
""This is a historic day for bilateral relations,"" said the EU's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, who witnessed the signing along with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez.
The BBC's Will Grant in Havana says the Cuba-EU accord is a major step to putting certain moments of hostility behind the two sides.
Havana objected to the EU's policy of urging political change on the island, and the EU suspended its relations with Cuba after scores of dissidents were imprisoned in 2003.
The deal must now be ratified by the 28 EU member-states.

"Derby City Council was taken to court over concerns for rare birds after work was approved and started on the track at The Sanctuary, in 2014.
David Lindo, known as the Urban Birder, said huge mounds of remaining rubble are ruining views at the beauty spot.
The authority said it has ""no budget"" to carry out the work at the site.
Mr Lindo has appeared on BBC One's Britain's Big Wildlife Revival among other programmes.
In 2012, council plans showed a 1.5km road circuit running between two bird hides and the reserve at Pride Park, near to where the city's velodrome was being built.
The move angered conservationists as the sanctuary was only established in 2003 and had since been successfully attracting rare birds.
Work began in 2014 but was stopped after Derbyshire Wildlife Trust took legal action.
Mr Lindo, who first visited the site in 2010, said he was ""dismayed"".
""There are ugly heaps of soil, rock, concrete, that are not conducive to nature. You can't see a thing.
""It's a beautiful oasis in the city given over to the people of Derby... the council should make it the gem it should be.""
Derby City Council said in a statement: ""Any replacement work at the nature reserve will require a new planning application and no budget has been identified for this or any work at this time.
""Given the current financial challenges this still remains the case.""

""I could not be happier to reach the final,"" said the 30-year-old Serb.

Seventh seed Gasquet saved two match points at 6-2 5-4 with a brilliant stretching drop-shot, before Monfils needed lengthy treatment in the next game when he injured his knee after slipping on the baseline.
Monfils recovered to take the set into a tie-break, only to miss a third match point before Gasquet, 31, forced a decider when Monfils double-faulted on the third set point.
Monfils, 30, failed to serve out for victory at 5-4, but took his fourth match point in the tie-breaker.

""I was hoping to do well but this is the dream result. I can fight for the trophy and I hope to perform,"" added Djokovic.
Djokovic has dropped to fourth in the world rankings after a turbulent year in which he has won only one title and split with his coaching team.
But the top seed, who is yet to drop a set in Eastbourne, is one more win away from his first grass-court title since winning Wimbledon in 2015.
Medvedev, a 21-year-old ranked 52nd in the world, did break Djokovic's serve in the first set, but it was not enough to stop the former world number one, who did not face another break point in the second set.

"The ride - on the theme ""as bare as you dare"" - is the seventh time the event has been held in the city.
Up to 250 people are thought to have taken part in the ""family friendly"" 6.5-mile (10km) city centre ride.
The event went ahead despite coinciding with a number of other planned city centre protests and marches.
But in a bid to ""stay well away from other protests"" - including those organised by the right wing faction South West Infidels, the Anti-Nazi League and Refugees Welcome - organisers of the naked bike ride decided to change the route.
The aptly named pub, The Full Moon in Stokes Croft, was the starting point but on the advice of police the route was amended to avoid College Green.
Event organiser, Will Bryson said: ""We're celebrating bikes and bodies but we also have a serious message - to highlight how vulnerable cyclists are on the roads.
""Our roads are still too dangerous for many people to even consider cycling, and far too many cyclists are killed on the roads each year.""
Bristol became England's first cycling city in 2008 and was awarded Â£22m to encourage residents to ride bicycles.

"The 50m (164ft) tall structures are set to disappear at Dunford Bridge in South Yorkshire as part of National Grid plans to remove ugly overhead lines.
The project has shortlisted 12 stretches of pylons in eight areas across the country.
A final decision on the Peak District plan will be made in March.
The pylons can be seen across a 12.8km (8m) stretch of the national park, starting near Penistone in South Yorkshire and ending at Tintwistle in Derbyshire.
Steve Knight-Gregson, from the National Grid, said: ""We have looked at national parks in England and Wales where we have overhead lines and a panel of experts and landscape architects have helped narrow it down to this shortlist.
""In the Peak District, this section of line is one of those that's made it through for further work.""
The scheme is funded by Ofgem, which will claw back the cost through an increase in customers' bills.
Plans to remove the pylons include replacing overhead lines with underground cables, screening lines from viewpoints and re-routing lines.
Anne Robinson, from Friends of the Peak District, said: ""There [were] a lot of studies done before this was set up to make sure the customers were behind it.
""There's no doubt that customers are willing to pay and have a very small sum added to their electricity bills a year to make sure these landscapes are enhanced.""
Pylons were introduced in the Peak District national park in the 1960s.
John Scott, from the Peak District National Park Authority, welcomed the news that they could be removed.
He said: ""These measures would greatly improve the appearance of the valley, which runs through some of the wildest moorland landscape in the Peak District.
""The pylon towers and the overhead cables are some of the most intrusive modern elements in a valley. This is clearly a very welcome proposal which would be of great benefit to the special character of this part of the Peak District.""
Other parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty shortlisted for the work include:
Nick Clack, from the  Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: ""This is a really positive step in reducing the impact of existing overhead electricity lines in some of our most valued countryside.
""Given these welcome efforts to mitigate the impact of existing lines, National Grid needs to make sure it is doing all it can to mitigate the impact of new ones.""",A stretch of power lines running through the Peak District national park could be buried underground as part of a £500m scheme.,30395684

"Mencap and the Challenging Behaviour Foundation have spoken of the risks of moving patients hundreds of miles.
The warning comes as the results of a serious case review into the abuse of patients at the private hospital near Bristol are due to be released.
The abuse was uncovered during secret filming by the BBC Panorama programme.
Eleven people have admitted charges of ill-treatment and neglect related to the abuse.
South Gloucestershire Safeguarding Adults Board (SAB) commissioned the review, carried out by an independent expert.
Mencap and the Challenging Behaviour said they had received 260 reports from families concerning abuse and neglect in institutional care since the Panorama programme was aired in May last year.
Their joint report - Out of Sight - detailed a number of serious incidences reported by families, including physical assault, sexual abuse and the overuse of restraint.
Mencap chief executive Mark Goldring said: ""We fear that unless the government commits to a strong action plan to close large institutions and develop appropriate local services for people with a learning disability, there is a very real risk that another Winterbourne View will come to light.""
There are currently hundreds of people with a learning disability in assessment and treatment units like Winterbourne View, the charities said.
Many of these are located hundreds of miles from home, where people are at particular risk of neglect and abuse, they added.
Vivien Cooper, founder of the Challenging Behaviour Foundation, said they had ""deep concerns"" over patient ""safety and welfare"".
""Many hundreds of people with a learning disability are being sent away to care institutions hundreds of miles from home, where they remain for years unnecessarily, at risk of neglect and abuse,"" she said.
A Department of Health spokeswoman said: ""We are clear that wherever possible people should be supported to live in their own homes within their local community.
""In a small number of cases people might need access to good quality assessment and treatment services which might include some short periods of in-patient care.
""However this is not a substitute for high quality care within the community.
""It is vital all services are commissioned properly, reviewed regularly and not used as a long-term solution.""
Twenty-four patients were transferred from Castlebeck-run Winterbourne View, near Hambrook, following the BBC investigation.

"At least 30 died when a suicide bomber targeted a crowd walking through the predominantly Sunni Adhamiya district to the Imam Moussa al-Kadhim mosque.
Eleven pilgrims were killed in other bombings across the capital.
Security had been stepped up to protect the thousands of pilgrims attending a festival that culminates on Thursday.
In pictures: Iraq pilgrimage
Vehicles had been banned in the mainly Shia area of Kadhimya, where the shrine is located, and 200,000 police officers and soldiers deployed along the pilgrims' main routes.
The authorities had also imposed a city-wide ban on motorbikes, bicycles and carts to help reduce the risk of vehicle-born attacks.
""We expect the terrorist groups to launch terrorist attacks against pilgrims during the coming hours, but our contingency plans will foil their vicious acts,"" Maj-Gen Ahmed al-Saedi had said earlier.
The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse in Baghdad says that while the overall level of violence is much lower than in recent years, and sectarian tensions have eased, attacks of this kind are all too frequent, particularly during high-profile religious events.
The religious festival marks the anniversary of the death in the 8th Century of Moussa al-Kadhim, the seventh of the 12 Shia imams. It was outlawed under Saddam Hussein, and has attracted large crowds since being revived.
An Adhamiya resident said he had been drinking tea and watching the pilgrims walk by when the suicide bomber struck.
""We heard a big explosion and everybody rushed to the site to see bodies and hear wounded people, screaming for help,"" Saif al-Azami told the Associated Press. ""We helped carry the wounded to the hospital before the ambulances arrived.""
Some of his Sunni friends, he said, had been serving food and water to the pilgrims and were killed or wounded in the attacks.
Despite the attacks, many pilgrims said they would not be deterred.
""Even in the time of Saddam, I came across the fields despite it being forbidden to travel to attend,"" Hamid Talib told AFP news agency.
""I would make the pilgrimage whatever the situation is.""
Layla Abbas, 63, who was being pushed in a wheelchair by her daughter toward the shrine, told Reuters: ""I'm disabled, yes, but my loyalty to Shia imams is not.""
In 2005, nearly 1,000 pilgrims were killed in a stampede on the Imams Bridge, which crosses the River Tigris between Kadhimya and Adhamiya, after rumours spread that a suicide bomber was walking among them.
Last year, two female suicide bombers blew themselves near the shrine, killing 65 people, including 20 Iranian pilgrims.
Wednesday's attacks come as the US military prepares to withdraw all combat troops from Iraq by the end of August.
There are fears the long-planned move could be hindered by the failure of Iraq's major political parties to form a coalition government following March's inconclusive parliamentary election.","More than 40 people have died and some 100 have been wounded in bomb attacks on Shia pilgrims converging on a shrine in northern Baghdad, say police.",10547390

The region needs to build on the planned electrification of Great Western and Valleys rail lines.
The network - which could be built by 2030 - would involve trains, buses and city trams and could cost over Â£2bn if it goes ahead.

"Monica Montore said the 32-year-old, who was released by the club in May 2015, was ""thrown out like a bad dog"".
Gutierrez is suing the club for around £2m for disability discrimination.
""I was so distressed at what they had done to Jonas, I just wanted to take my own life at the club's door,"" Ms Montore told the employment tribunal.
""I was going to leave a letter to say what a terrible way they had treated Jonas.
""He returns from his operation to have lost a testicle - from a hit on Newcastle's pitch, he returns from that operation and they throw him out like a bad dog.""
Former Argentina midfielder Gutierrez, who was first diagnosed with testicular cancer in October 2013, alleges he was deliberately left out of the Magpies side so they would not trigger an automatic extension clause in his contract.
Newcastle contest the claims, with representatives including former managers Alan Pardew and John Carver set to give evidence during the tribunal in Birmingham.
Ms Montore claimed she discussed committing suicide with one of Gutierrez's lawyers, Colin Pomford, in January 2014 - soon after he had been told by manager Pardew that he was no longer needed by the club.
""I told Colin that I felt so desperate and low about the situation that I considered harming myself,"" Ms Montore, who is also her son's manager, told the tribunal on Wednesday.
""I asked Colin what the club would do if I were to commit suicide at the stadium, leaving a note explaining that this was due to the despair that I felt about the discrimination my son was facing by the club.
""Looking back, even expressing such thoughts looks extreme but I cannot deny that it happened and it brings back very clear memories.""
Under cross-examination from Newcastle's barrister, Sean Jones QC, Ms Montore was asked to explain why she had not raised her concerns about discrimination directly with the Premier League club.
""You were going to raise the subject of discrimination in a suicide note?
""If you had genuinely thought that your son was being discriminated against - rather than just treated insensitively - you would have raised it formally wouldn't you?"" he said.
Ms Montore answered: ""I think you are trying to dress a monkey with a silk dress and trying to pretend that it is a princess.""
Gutierrez claims he had to start 80 games during a four-year contract signed in September 2011 in order to trigger a further year at the end of the 2014-15 season.
He alleges temporary boss Carver waited until he could not hit his 80-game target before starting him in the final five matches of the campaign.
However, Lee Charnley, Newcastle's managing director, told the tribunal better players had simply overtaken Gutierrez and he was allowed to leave for sporting reasons.
""The suggestion that our reason for influencing team selection was to avoid extending Jonas' contract because he had cancer is offensive and untrue,"" Charnley said.
""The fact of Jonas' cancer had no influence whatsoever on our actions or decisions regarding Jonas at any time.
""All the allegations made by Jonas are completely denied by the club - neither I nor anybody at the club has or ever would seek to victimise or disadvantage any one of our employees on the basis of ill health.""

"""The FSA [Financial Services Authority] was stretched almost to breaking point.""
It is a comment given to one of the report's authors, Andrew Green, by Sir Hector Sants, the chief executive of the FSA from 2007 until 2012.
Reading through both HBOS reports, time and again it is revealed that major questions about why a bank was engaged in reckless lending are missed.
Opportunities to rein in excessive lending are rejected.
And the option of starting proper investigations and enforcement actions into who might be ""personally culpable"" for failures lost as increasingly desperate attempts were made to keep the banking system on its feet.
Indeed, Clive Adamson, the former director of supervision at the FSA, said that ""the people most culpable were let off"".
Keeping the ATMs open became the focus for a regulator that was ""facing a day-to-day survival game"" in the banking system.
That may be understandable in the teeth of a storm.
But the fact that the storm was allowed to gain such ferocity before someone started asking if the flood defences were secure is important.
And why it is worth studying closely today's reports on HBOS, even though for anyone who has looked at the investigations into the collapse of Northern Rock and Royal Bank of Scotland the criticisms will be wearily familiar.
Of course, the failure of HBOS was ultimately down to the management and board of the bank.
The bank rapidly increased lending to risky property ventures in Britain and abroad during a period of ""almost uninterrupted economic growth"".
It seemed like a one-way bet that could not fail.
HBOS financed that lending through what are known as the ""wholesale markets"" - funding provided by other banks.
Increasing market share was the key.
For a time it was hugely profitable - and flattered the bank's bottom line, much to the delight of investors.
When questions were raised about the major problems inherent in this approach they were often rejected, as the ""risk function"" at HBOS was seen as far less important than the race to make ever higher profits
When the property market started turning sour, HBOS was exposed. Wholesale funding started to dry up and ""inappropriate risk taking"" over many years was quickly revealed as unsustainable.
So, where were the police officers?
The stability of the bank was regulated by the FSA.
""Overall the FSA's approach was too trusting of firms' management and insufficiently challenging,"" the Bank of England report into HBOS says.
It also puts that in context, saying that ""sustained political emphasis"" during the era of the Labour government on ""light-touch regulation"" and the need to keep London ""competitive"" weighed heavily.
It is worth repeating Paragraph 1117 (yes, there are an awful lot of them) in full.
""It was inherently unlikely that senior leaders of the FSA would have proposed, before the first signs of the financial crisis, a supervisory approach which entailed higher capital and liquidity requirements, supervisory caps on rapid bank balance sheet growth, or intensive analysis of asset quality,"" the key paragraph says.
""If they had, it is likely that their proposals would have been met by extensive complaints that the FSA was pursuing a heavy-handed 'gold-plating' approach which would harm London's competitiveness.""
Could it happen again? Of course, no-one can give an ultimate guarantee that any financial system is totally secure.
But, certainly, the capital and liquidity requirements for banks today are far higher.
And regulators are more intrusive.
But, as some argue that regulation has gone too far, it is worth remembering the content of these two reports on the collapse of HBOS, the failure of the policing system and the ultimate cost that was paid by the public.","In one sentence, the major regulator of a crisis-ridden banking system reveals the truth about the chaos in the run-up to the financial crisis.",34869083

"The midfielder, 34, was suspended over a training ground row in September and has since been charged by the Scottish FA for breaching gambling rules.
Barton, who remains on full pay, was asked to attend a hearing at the Scottish Premiership club but refused.
It is understood talks between both parties have reached a stalemate over the disciplinary process.
Barton joined Rangers from Burnley on a two-year contract in May.
But, after eight appearances, he was suspended by the club following a reported altercation with team-mate Andy Halliday as players reviewed September's 5-1 defeat by Celtic. He was due to return on 10 October.
The SFA then alleged that Barton had breached rules by placing 44 bets on matches between 1 July and 15 September.
Rangers subsequently announced that the player had been told to stay away for another seven days after launching a ""formal disciplinary procedure"".
Barton asked for more time to consider the SFA charge against him.
The parent body's disciplinary rule 33 prohibits players, coaches, club officials and referees in Scotland from betting on football anywhere in the world. A hearing is now due on 17 November.
In Barton's absence, Rangers have won three, drawn one and lost another in all competitions.
Capped once by England, Barton has made more than 400 senior club appearances in a career that has taken in spells at Manchester City, Newcastle United, QPR and Marseille.
He has won the Championship with Newcastle and Burnley and was also part of QPR's Championship play-off final-winning side in 2014.",Joey Barton will not report back for training at Rangers on Monday and is unlikely to play for the club again.,37661118
"Bike enthusiast Paul Hodgson set the records at Bonneville Speed Week in Utah between 13 and 19 August on the machine he designed and built at his Lonan home.
He said he was ""very tired, happy and content"" with his achievements.
The former British sprint champion's fastest speed was more than 181mph (291 km/h).
Mr Hodgson, who was also chief engineer when a Manx team broke a 33-year-old speed record in 2012, saw his records come in four separate categories of the modified 500cc class, based on fuel type, frame and streamlining.
The Manx Gas Service technician was responsible for the design, electronics and all engineering work on the bike, which started as a 1994 Yamaha FZR600.
He originally shipped the bike to the US to take part in last year's Bonneville event, but it was cancelled, leaving him separated from machine for a ""frustrating"" 12 months.

"Kelsey Whitehead's employers loaned her £5,000 to fund private treatment and gave her almost £10,000 in sick pay.
Whitehead, 38, shaved her hair and inserted a drip into her chest as part of the deception.
She was given a 12-month suspended jail sentence in March after admitting two counts of fraud.
More on this and other Lincolnshire stories
At a confiscation hearing at Lincoln Crown Court Judge John Pini QC ordered that Whitehead should pay a nominal sum as no assets had been identified.
The court heard that Whitehead, of Lea Road, Gainsborough, told her boss at Hull-based firm Carbon Electric that she had stage four metastatic osteosarcoma that had spread throughout her body.
She went on to claim the NHS had refused to pay for her treatment and would only fund palliative care, forcing her to go private.
Phil Howes, prosecuting, said Whitehead displayed symptoms she had researched on the internet.
He added Whitehead also shaved off her hair and used make-up to give the impression she was not sleeping at night and would vomit at work.
Whitehead's wife Sophie was so taken in that she gave up her job to care for her.
The hoax came to light in May 2016 after Whitehead took an overdose and was admitted to hospital.
Mr Howes said when her partner informed medics that Whitehead had cancer ""they did the checks and there was no record of it"".
""This was an elaborate hoax in order to get money that she wasn't entitled to and get a loan she wasn't entitled to,"" he added.

"It is part of a wide-reaching programme to modernise the country's military.
Speaking at an arms fair, Mr Putin said the weapons would be able to overcome even the most technically advanced anti-missile defence systems.
It comes after the US proposed increasing its military presence in Nato states in Eastern Europe.
Tensions are high over Russia's role in the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Nato and Western leaders accuse Russia of sending soldiers and heavy weapons, including tanks and missiles, to the pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied this, insisting that any Russians fighting there are ""volunteers"".
All numbers are approximate estimates
Source: Federation of American Scientists
Russia has increased its defence spending substantially under Vladimir Putin, and is in the midst of a massive modernisation programme,  says the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow.
The missiles are high-tech replacements, not additions to Russia's nuclear arsenal, but the nod to the US is clear, our correspondent says.
Russian officials have warned that Moscow will respond if the US carries out its plan to store heavy military equipment in Eastern Europe, including in the Baltic states that were once part of the Soviet Union.
""The feeling is that our colleagues from Nato countries are pushing us into an arms race,"" RIA news agency quoted Russian Deputy Defence Minister Anatoly Antonov as saying on the sidelines of the arms fair outside Moscow.
Amidst the rising tensions with the West, Russian President Vladimir Putin has placed a renewed emphasis upon his country's nuclear arsenal.
This is in part a reflection of Russia's continuing conventional military weakness. Moscow is in the midst of a significant modernisation of its strategic nuclear weapons with new ballistic missiles being deployed, more modern bombers, and new submarines being launched.
Over recent years, older, obsolete weapons have been withdrawn from service, so the size of Russia's overall arsenal has been shrinking.
However, this decline could soon come to an end, raising all sorts of questions for other nuclear powers.
What most alarms the West is the renewed emphasis in Russian rhetoric on nuclear rather than conventional forces.
Threats to deploy short-range nuclear weapons in Crimea have been accompanied by veiled warnings of nuclear targeting against Nato members who might host ballistic missile defences.","President Vladimir Putin has said Russia will put more than 40 new, inter-continental ballistic missiles into service this year.",33151125
"The UK said it would establish the 834,000-sq-km (322,000-sq-mile) zone around the Pitcairn Islands in the Pacific in 2015.
Data gathered by the drone will be beamed back to a satellite watch room to help prosecute unauthorised trawling.
The drone will patrol areas in the reserve designated as no-fishing zones.
The drone, made by US firm Liquid Robotics, will be directed by staff at the satellite watch room which is monitoring fishing vessels. The craft is equipped with a camera that can take snaps of fishing vessels that are in restricted areas, and satellite technology that can pinpoint their location. The unmanned craft starting patrolling late last month.
The Liquid Robotics drone, called a Wave Glider, is a two-part craft made up of an instrument-bearing boat that floats on the ocean surface that is tethered to a submersible. The craft uses the differential motion between the sea surface and the region the submersible traverses to propel itself.
The self-propelling propulsion system means the Wave Glider can stay at sea for months at a time.
The UK said it established the marine-protected area in the Pitcairns in 2015 and, at the same time, created a watchdog organisation that would try to protect its abundant sea life from fishing.
The seas around the Pitcairns are believed to be home to more than 1,200 species of fish, marine mammals and birds - some of which are unique to the region. It also supports the world's deepest and most well-developed coral reef.

"There is currently some disagreement over whether Article 50 would need to come before Parliament.
But former journalist Baroness Wheatcroft said if it did, ""the Lords might actually delay things"".
The government has previously stated that Article 50 could be triggered through use of the royal prerogative.
Speaking to The Times, the former editor in chief of the Wall Street Journal Europe and the Sunday Telegraph said that she hoped delays in the Lords of any potential Brexit legislation would lead to a second referendum.
A legal challenge on whether the government can trigger Article 50 without the authorisation of Parliament will be heard in the High Court in the autumn.
Lady Wheatcroft said that she did not want the Lords to stand in the way of the UK leaving the EU at the moment, but added: ""However, if it comes to a bill, I think the Lords might actually delay things. I think there's a majority in the Lords for remaining.""
Asked whether she would support peers delaying Brexit legislation she said: ""Yes I would.
""And I would hope, while we delayed things, that there would be sufficient movement in the EU to justify putting it to the electorate, either through a general election or a second referendum.""
Prime Minister Theresa May has insisted that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and that her focus is on securing the best possible deal for the UK outside the EU.
Lord Bridges of Headley, Minister for Exiting the EU, told peers in July: ""The government's position is that there is no legal obligation to consult Parliament on triggering Article 50"", since ""it affects the position in international law and not in domestic law"".

"Writing in the Sun in July, MacKenzie said a reporter wearing a headscarf should not have been allowed to report on the Nice terror attacks.
Manji said Ipso's clearing of MacKenzie signified ""open season"" on minorities.
But MacKenzie told BBC News there was a ""legitimate debate"" to be had about journalists wearing symbols of faith.
In a statement to the corporation, he said: ""I agree 100% that no Muslim should be prevented from covering any story.
""But there is a legitimate debate about whether it is appropriate for journalists to wear prominent symbols of their faith on air, particularly when reporting on stories with a religious angle.""
He also drew attention to the BBC's own debate around the issue several years ago, when bosses at the corporation were considering what was appropriate for newsreaders to wear.
MacKenzie added: ""Let's not lose sight of that fact that for many people, including Muslims, the hijab is a symbol of the subjugation and oppression of women. In some countries, women are physically attacked, arrested and imprisoned for not covering their heads.
""Whatever your perspective, it is an important debate and we should not be banned from discussing it.""
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday morning, Manji said: ""I think the fact that Kelvin MacKenzie can write a column and suggest that I am somehow sympathetic to a perpetrator of a terrorist attack, that somehow I am not like the rest of us, that I am the other, means that other people are now open to attack.""
""It was upsetting enough to find my picture in what is Britain's most widely read newspaper next to the words 'Muslim terror attack,'"" she told Mishal Husain.
""It was upsetting enough to find myself the latest victim to Kelvin Mackenzie's tirade. But now to know that has been given the green light by the press regulator and that effectively it is open season on minorities, and Muslims in particular, is frightening.""
Manji added that she had been ""contacted privately by individuals who work at The Sun and at News UK to say they were embarrassed and ashamed that MacKenzie was allow to peddle such hatred"".
In his original column, MacKenzie asked: ""Was it appropriate for [Manji] to be on camera when there had been yet another shocking slaughter by a Muslim?""
He argued the hijab was a ""religious statement"" and questioned whether a Christian would be able to wear a cross prominently on television.
Manji told the BBC: ""This debate about religious symbols to me is a manufactured debate by the Sun and Kelvin MacKenzie. He is not a public philosopher of our time, he's not interested in religious symbols
""A third of the victims [in Nice] were Muslim, a 62-year-old grandmother was slaughtered that night, she, like me, was called Fatima and also wore a headscarf.""

""The article did not include a prejudicial or pejorative reference to the complainant on the grounds of religion.""
""While the columnist's opinion was undoubtedly offensive to the complainant, and to others, these were views he had been entitled to express.""
Responding to the ruling, Ben De Pear, the editor of Channel 4 News, said: ""Whilst we agree that freedom of expression is a fundamental right, we do not believe that it should be used as a licence to incite or discriminate.""
""We see no reason why a Muslim journalist should be prevented from covering any story and Fatima will continue to report and present the news on the issues of the day with impartiality and depth.""

""You can interrupt me from time to time,"" said the European Commission president. ""I will not at each time respond to what you are saying because what you are saying is worthless.""
Reports suggested that the rebuke was aimed at UKIP leader Nigel Farage, but Mr Farage claimed it was directed at Scottish UKIP MEP David Coburn.

DCGS is a communications network for military and intelligence units.
Twenty-two people died at the Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital on 3 October.
There is no clear indication yet that any disruption of the DCGS network had a direct impact on the decision to attack the hospital.
However, it has not yet been explained why military commanders made that decision, given that the Pentagon has commented the strike was not ""intentional"".

Aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has been deeply critical of the strike and says that Mr Hunter's comments ""reinforce"" the need for an independent investigation.
Various inquiries, by the US Department of Justice, the Pentagon, Nato and an American-Afghan team have been requested.

Det Insp Fitzgibbons said Adams had preyed on the girls' vulnerability and age for his own satisfaction.
""This is a truly despicable crime,"" he said.

"But Rex Tillerson has come pretty close to saying the agreement is not worth keeping, even though he's had to admit it's working.
This week the secretary of state informed congress that Tehran is keeping its side of the bargain to restrict its nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, which he's required to confirm every 90 days.
In spoken remarks, though, he talked only of Iran's bad behaviour and linked that to the future of the deal - a message that will resonate far more on Capitol Hill and to which it was probably aimed.
Former President Barack Obama would have agreed with all the charges: that Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism, that it supports proxies which undermine US interests in the region, that it's hostile to Israel and that its ballistic missile tests challenge UN Security Council prohibitions.
But Mr Obama kept those issues separate from the nuclear agreement, which would have been impossible to achieve without that narrow focus.
Mr Tillerson, on the other hand, called this a mistaken approach and said the review would take a comprehensive look at all of the threats posed by Iran.
He also gave the deal itself short shrift.
He said it delayed rather than blocked Iran's goal of becoming a nuclear state, ignoring arguments even by critics that it has reduced a significant security threat for now.
Iran, for its part, continues to deny it was ever trying to develop nuclear weapons.
And the secretary of state raised the stakes by bringing in comparisons to North Korea.
He dismissed the agreement as a short-term effort to ""buy off a power who has nuclear ambitions"" that would backfire in the long term, the kind of approach that he said failed with Pyongyang.
Indeed, ""an unchecked Iran has the potential to travel the same path as North Korea,"" he said. ""The Trump administration has no intention of passing the buck to a future administration on Iran.""
That doesn't necessarily mean it will ""tear up"" the deal, which was agreed with five other world powers.
More likely, it would pursue the strictest enforcement possible, in particular by increasing pressure on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
In parallel, there is growing bipartisan support in Congress for additional sanctions over Iran's ballistic missile programme, human rights violations and support for terrorist groups.
Such an approach might not violate the letter of US commitments but could still jeopardize the agreement.
Tehran would almost certainly accuse the Trump administration of non-compliance and might eventually decide to withdraw.",In announcing a broad review of Iran policy the Trump administration has not jettisoned the nuclear deal.,39649686

"However, think tank ""dpart"" concluded teenagers were more likely to vote if they talked politics with family.
The September 18 independence referendum is the first time in the UK that 16 and 17-year-olds will be allowed at the ballot box.
They will be asked: ""Should Scotland be an independent country?""
Research by Dr Jan Eichhorn, Anne Heyer and Christine Huebner
Lead researcher for dpart, Dr Jan Eichhorn, told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""We were not only looking into whether [young people] were leaning yes or no, but whether some of the critics were right in saying that young people simply follow the lead of their parents or what is told in school, and they don't.
""They really make up their mind in quite a complex way themselves and that is really encouraging to see.""
Dr Eichhorn added: ""We actually found that only just over half of the young people had the same voting intention as one of their parents - so it is nearly 50/50 which clearly does not present a picture of young people who simply follow their parents.""
The academic believed, that like the rest of the electorate in Scotland, young people wanted more information. But where are they getting it from?
As well as parents and teachers, those involved with the Scottish Youth Parliament are doing their bit to engage young people through a series of sessions up and down the country.
Kyle Thornton, chair of the Scottish Youth Parliament, said the aim was to educate young people in a more ""fun engaging manner"".
""The people who take part in our sessions come out of it feeling they've actually learnt something and a lot of the time, it just starts that spark and thought process about the referendum,"" he said.
Seventeen-year-old Christopher Clannachan, who took part in one of the events, in the chamber of East Ayrshire Council, said: ""I feel more informed than I did before the session.
""I still don't fully understand all the issues around the referendum but I do feel like I'd know how to vote now.
""And I'll definitely go online and do some research before I make an informed decision.""
Another participant, Rachael Robertson, 16, added: ""I'll watch more debates and read up on the referendum now.""
The two official campaigns for independence and the Union - Yes Scotland and Better Together - have their own strategies targeted at young voters.
Source: About My Vote
Yes Scotland operations manager Sarah Jane Walls said the organisation had enlisted young people to get involved in its campaign.
She said: ""We will continue speaking to schools, and so far the number of young people involved in the campaign has hit such a level that we will soon be creating local youth groups that are independent of our already established local groups.""
Ms Walls added that the youth groups would be tasked with organising activities in their local areas, like speaking to youth clubs and hosting social events, and social media was an important factor too.
Ross MacRae, from Better Together, said it had a team of more than 300 youth representatives.
He added: ""To compliment the work of our youth reps the campaign has developed a raft of materials for young voters with the help of our youth reps.
""These materials are available to schools, colleges and youth groups on request and the feedback we've had has been very positive.""",Researchers have found no clear evidence young people would vote the same as their parents in the Scottish independence referendum.,26265299
"The New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times and Huffington Post were among those leading their online coverage with Mr Sanders' victory over Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton there.
Many writers suggested the issue of international trade deals had swayed blue-collar voters, many of whom believe such agreements have cost American jobs.
But while the victory is seen as invigorating Mr Sanders' campaign, many also point to Mrs Clinton's huge win in Mississippi. This has given her an overall victory in the number of delegates secured on the night.
Sam Frizell writing in Time magazine said Mr Sanders' win ""in the large, demographically diverse state with a big manufacturing base is crucial for the survival of his campaign, and he proved with his Tuesday night coup that he can still win a hard-fought contest despite lagging in the overall delegate count"".
Ben Geier, writing for Fortune, says Mr Sanders' victory has ""changed the race for the Democratic nomination"".
He adds: ""He will likely be able to use this win to get another round of fundraising, as most of his donors are individuals who haven't maxed out their donation totals; if they gave $10 in October, he can ask them to give another $10 now. And given the general enthusiasm of Sanders voters, it's a good bet a lot of them will.""
The Washington Post says the Michigan result ""raises the stakes for a candidates' debate on Wednesday from delegate-rich Florida"", which holds its primary next Tuesday.
Yamiche Alcindor and Patrick Healy in the New York Times, write that Mr Sanders' ""startling upset"" in Michigan came by ""hammering Mrs Clinton on an issue that resonated in this still-struggling state: her past support for trade deals that workers here believe robbed them of manufacturing jobs"".
They add: ""For Mrs Clinton, it was a stinging defeat... a reminder of her weakness among two key voting blocs: working-class white men and independent voters. The setback will almost certainly lead her to sharpen or even rethink her economic message, which does not seem to be reaching voters who feel betrayed by the Democratic Party's embrace of free trade and left behind by the forces of globalisation and deregulation.""
John Cassidy, in The New Yorker, writes that although Mr Trump and Mr Sanders differ wildly, ""they both claim that the existing political system is broken, and that radical measures and new leaders are needed to fix it"".
""If this message were to prove equally successful in other industrial states, such as Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, it would have big implications for the general election in addition to the primaries.""
He says that although it appears Mr Sanders' chance on closing the delegate gap with Mrs Clinton ""appears slim"", he ""could remain competitive until the big primaries in New York and California, where he is hoping to pull off more upsets. This calculus may seem unlikely. Until last night, however, it seemed unlikely that he would win in Michigan"".
Alex Seitz-Wald, for MSNBC, writes that Mr Sanders' ""advisers had long predicted the beginning of March would be rough for them, thanks to the high concentration of southern states with large African-American populations that so far have favoured Clinton by wide margins.
""But with those states now in the rear view mirror, Sanders' campaign expects to sail into friendlier waters later in the month, beginning next Tuesday (when votes are held in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio).""","Although the latest primary and caucus elections highlighted Donald Trump's continuing march to the Republican nomination for the US presidency, many in the US media chose to focus on the shock win for Bernie Sanders in the Democratic battle in Michigan.",35761490
"The investigations span all tiers of football, ""from premier clubs through to amateur"", the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said.
Police forces across the country are continuing to receive calls, it added.
Of the identified victims, 98% were male, and the age at the time of abuse was between seven and 20, police said.
A total of 639 referrals had been received from the helpline set up by the children's charity the NSPCC, and directly from police forces.
The information is being passed to Operation Hydrant - which oversees the investigation of allegations of ""non-recent"" child sex abuse within institutions - which collates it and shares it across forces.
The NPCC's lead for child protection said the allegations were ""being swiftly acted upon"" by police.
Although 98 football clubs had been ""referenced"", not all were necessarily under investigation, the police said.
And it said the number of victims, previously reported to be 350, continued to apply until all the referrals had been analysed and processed.
Gloucestershire Constabulary has become the latest police force to confirm it is investigating claims, saying ""some allegations of non-recent sexual abuse"" had been received.
More than 20 other forces have launched similar inquiries, including the Met, South Wales, Greater Manchester, Cheshire, Hampshire, Police Scotland and the Police Service of Northern Ireland.
Meanwhile, Premier League boss Richard Scudamore has written to the parents of more than 3,000 players in the league's youth system to reassure them their children are being protected.
In the letter, which was sent on Wednesday to the parents of children aged eight to 18, Mr Scudamore said the league had been ""very concerned"" by the allegations of historical sexual abuse at professional football clubs.
""The victims and survivors have been extremely brave to come forward and have our sympathy and support,"" he wrote.
""Given the volume of media coverage these disturbing stories understandably continue to generate, it is important that you... are made aware of the current standards and provisions in place to keep your children safe.""
Mr Scudamore went on to outline the Premier League's various safeguarding measures.
He added: ""There is no complacency - the Premier League's own safeguarding team and independent monitors visit each club regularly throughout every season to assess the quality of their work and guide them on any developments that could be made.""
Three weeks ago, ex-Crewe defender Andy Woodward waived his right to anonymity to say he had been a victim of sexual abuse as a young footballer.
Since then, more than 20 former footballers - including ex-youth players, trainees and professionals - have come forward with allegations of historical abuse in football.
Governing body the Football Association has announced an internal review.
A leading civil rights lawyer has backed calls for an inquiry into child abuse in Scottish football.
Raju Bhatt, who sat on the independent panel into the Hillsborough disaster, said failure to do so would be a betrayal of the victims.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already rejected calls for a current inquiry into the abuse of children in care to be widened, saying it should be down to the police to probe football abuse claims.
Children's charity the NSPCC said the ""shocking"" numbers had revealed the ""deeply disturbing extent of abuse"" in football.
It said its football hotline, launched with the support of the FA, had seen a ""staggering surge"" in calls in its first week.
The hotline set up by the NSPCC is available 24 hours a day on 0800 0232642.

"The incident follows two separate attacks on an Orange hall in County Tyrone earlier in the week.
The damage to the hall on Main Street was discovered by police at about 02:30 GMT on Saturday.
The graffiti, which related to the 1916 Easter Rising, was daubed on the exterior of the building.
The police say they are treating the incident as a hate crime.
Grand secretary of the Orange Lodge, Drew Nelson, condemned the attack, saying: ""It is very concerning that there has been three attacks on two Orange halls over the course of recent days.
""It is evident that there are those who display their hatred of what the Orange institution stands for by shamelessly attacking our properties.""
Referring to the Easter Rising graffiti, Mr Nelson said the Orange Order ""recognises that this is a challenging year"".
He added: ""We sincerely hope people will not use the centenary of the Easter Rising in a few weeks as an excuse and smokescreen to attack the symbolic buildings of their Protestant neighbours.
""Nonetheless, we would be very confident these attacks on our halls are emanating from a very tiny group of individuals, and are in no way representative of the vast majority of the wider community who are vehemently opposed to such criminality.""

"The discovery suggested healthy bacteria might one day be used to treat obesity, they told the journal Cell.
By studying human twins, they found a type of bacteria that was not only associated with being thin but also seemed to run in families.
Transplanting some of these microbes into mice slowed down weight gain.
The study is the first to suggest certain types of naturally occurring gut bacteria are inherited.
Analysing faecal samples from 416 UK twin pairs, the researchers found the abundance of Christensenellaceae bacteria was more similar in identical twins, who share exact DNA, than in fraternal twins, who are genetically just like ordinary siblings.
The results also showed Christensenellaceae was more common in lean individuals.
When the researchers treated mice with a specific member of this bacterial family, isolated from the twin study, the animals gained less weight than mice that did not get this treatment.
Study leader Dr Ruth Ley, associate professor in the department of microbiology at Cornell University, said even though their initial findings had suggested the bacterium could be contributing to a ""lean phenotype"", they had been fairly stunned to see its effect in mice and had repeated the experiment several times.
They are now working to identify what genes seem to influence the presence of Christensenellaceae bacteria and why it would have this effect on weight.
""Once we have found out how it works in mice, if it seems like we can apply that to humans we can look into developing this as a probiotic to regulate weight.""
However, Dr Ley pointed out that the overarching factor contributing to obesity was a sedentary lifestyle.
Prof David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said the results took the argument further away from poor personal choice ""when you realise we have millions of gut bacteria that are making these decisions for us"".
""It is very exciting data and a rapidly evolving field. It is like science fiction - these small creatures that we can't identify and we're full of them.""
He added: ""It begs so many questions like if you take too many antibiotics what does that do to your gut bacteria?""","Our genes influence whether we are fat or thin by shaping which types of microbes thrive in our gut, scientists say.",29904132

"The tie-up will create one of the largest exchange companies in the world with a combined value of about £21bn.
Under the terms of the deal, LSE shareholders will own 45.6% of the new holding company,  while Deutsche Boerse shareholders will own 54.4%.
LSE chief executive Xavier Rolet said the two firms were ""creating an industry-defining combination"".
The two companies said together they should be able to make cost savings of €450m (£354m) a year, about 20% of the combined group's operating costs of €2.2bn last year.
The LSE group already owns Milan-based Borsa Italiana.
The two exchanges said the ""combination of London, Frankfurt and Milan will provide a platform for financing and promoting economic growth of European companies and be an attractive offering to Asian and US companies looking to access investors and capital"".
The newly-merged company will keep both the London and Frankfurt headquarters. The new holding company, UK TopCo, will be incorporated in the UK.
The merger is expected to be completed by the end of this year or early next year.
When it goes through, Mr Rolet will step down from his role as LSE chief executive, but will stay on for about a year to advise on the transition.
LSE chairman Donald Brydon will become chairman of UK TopCo and Deutsche Boerse chief executive, Carsten Kengeter, will become chief executive.
The boards of both the LSE and Deutsche Boerse have said they will recommended that their shareholders accept the offer.
However, earlier this month, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which owns the New York Stock Exchange, said it was considering making an offer for the LSE. It is not yet known whether it will go ahead with a hostile bid.
The LSE and Deutsche Boerse have set up a referendum committee to consider what impact a Leave vote in the EU Referendum might have.
At this stage, though both companies say the outcome of the Referendum is not a condition of the merger because they believe the combined group would be ""well positioned to serve global customers irrespective of the outcome of the vote"".
However, they added: ""The outcome of that vote might well affect the volume or nature of the business carried out by the Combined Group. ""
About 30% of the new group's revenue would come from the UK, 15% from Germany, 30% from the rest of Europe, 19% from North America and 6% from the rest of the world, mainly Asia.
The merger would mean the group is ""better positioned to compete against large US peers in North America"", as well as boosting its position in China and Asia generally,"" said the LSE in its statement.","The London Stock Exchange Group (LSE) and Deutsche Boerse have agreed terms for a ""merger of equals"".",35818997

"Milo Yiannopoulos said in a statement his ""poor choice of words"" was detracting from his colleagues' work, so he was quitting immediately.
He had already lost a book deal and a speaking engagement over the row.
Videos surfaced of him discussing the merits of gay relationships between adults and boys.
But Mr Yiannopoulos, the tech editor, denied he had endorsed child abuse and said one video had been edited to give a misleading impression.
""I would like to restate my utter disgust at adults who sexually abuse minors,"" the 32-year-old wrote in his resignation statement on Facebook on Tuesday.
At a press conference on Tuesday, he explained that he had been referring to his own experiences as a victim of child sexual abuse.
He said that two men, including a priest, had touched him inappropriately when he was in his young teens.
""I haven't ever apologised before, and I don't intend on ever doing it again,"" the hero of the so-called alt-right movement read to a room full of reporters.
""To be a victim of child abuse and at the same time be accused of being an apologist for child abuse is absurd.""
But the mea culpa came too late to save him from being axed in the line-up at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland.
The organising group, the American Conservative Union, said his response had been ""insufficient"".
Publisher Simon & Schuster also cancelled his forthcoming book, Dangerous.
During his press conference he claimed to have received interest from other publishers, and vowed to set aside 10% of the book's profits to donate to charities that support victims of child sex abuse.
The British writer appears to thrive on controversy and is accused by some of being a peddler of hate speech.

"Ryan Henderson, 28, formerly of Fort Augustus, was last year jailed for 18 years in England for raping a three-year-old and a woman.
Henderson has been on trial at the High Court in Edinburgh facing further sex charges beginning when he was aged 12.
The proceedings have come to an end with his acquittal.
Judge Lord Ericht decided that rules on mutual corroboration could not apply because of the time gap of almost eight years between the alleged offences.
Previous legal authority had held that the Moorov doctrine, where evidence from different witnesses linked in time, circumstance and character can establish a course of criminal conduct, did not apply with such an interval between charges.
Lord Ericht told jurors when they returned to court after a legal debate: ""The issue which had arisen was whether the Crown had led sufficient evidence in law to justify any possible conviction of the accused.""
He said he had made a decision to the effect that in law Henderson had no case to answer in relation to the matters on which he was charged and acquitted him.
By that stage of the trial Henderson was facing two indecency charges and one of attempted rape against a girl alleged to have been committed in Fort Augustus between 2000 and 2003.
The abuse was alleged to have begun when the girl was aged nine.

Mr ap Iorwerth was taking calls on the Jason Mohammad programme on Tuesday, while Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood launched the party's manifesto in Rhondda.
He said the party accepted the referendum vote for the UK to leave the European Union, but added: ""We can leave in different ways.""
The AM said Plaid wanted the ""best possible Brexit"" for Welsh business and industry, including single market access, and continued opportunities of links with Europe for the nation's children.
On the question of devolution, Mr ap Iorwerth claimed more powers for Wales could help hold the UK together.

"Imports meanwhile fell 12.3% in yuan terms compared to forecasts for a fall of more than 11%.
The numbers mean the country's monthly trade surplus has shrunk to its smallest in 13 months.
China's economy grew by 7.4% in 2014, its weakest for almost 25 years.
Analysts said recent indicators showed further signs the slowdown is continuing.
In US dollar terms, China's exports for the month fell 15%, while imports fell 12.7%.
Currency conversion factors based on US dollar and Chinese yuan movements over the last year mean some official numbers from the mainland are now reported in both currencies.
The official March data leaves the country with a monthly trade surplus of 18.16bn Chinese yuan ($2.92bn; Â£1.99bn).
In February, China's monthly trade surplus hit a record $60.6bn, as exports grew and imports slid back.
Analysts said the export numbers for March were a surprise.
""We can understand the imports fell because of falling imports of commodities, but exports fell so much, it was very much unexpected,"" said Shanghai-based analyst Nie Wen from Hwabao Trust.
However, he said one major reason for the falling exports was yuan appreciation.

"Archbishop Eamon Martin and Archbishop Richard Clarke were at Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin on Wednesday.
They were joined by bishops and lay people who will accompany them on the pilgrimage for the battle's centenary.
The archbishops said they hope the battle shows the  futility of violence and the need for peace.
The Battle of the Somme saw about 500,000 casualties, and all to move the frontline about four miles in four-and-a-half months.
Fighting for the British were both Ulstermen opposed to Home Rule and former Irish Volunteers fighting for Home Rule, all in the shadow of the 1916 Easter Rising that would eventually pave the way to Irish independence.
The group going to the Somme started their pilgrimage of peace at Glasnevin Cemetery, where many of those who fought in the Easter Rising are buried.
They were given a guided tour that included a visit to the graves of some of those who died fighting in World War One.
For both archbishops of Armagh, their voyage is not just political and spiritual, but also personal.
Dr Martin, the Catholic primate of All-Ireland, hopes to find the grave of a granduncle who is buried in Flanders fields, while Dr Clarke's late wife also had a granduncle buried there.
""It really cemented within me the sense of the futility of war, where hundreds of thousands of young people had their lives uprooted and destroyed,"" Dr Martin said.
""And for me as a religious leader it re-affirms my commitment to peace, reconciliation and healing.""
The Church of Ireland primate, Dr Clarke, said: ""Overall, you look back at nearly 20,000 dead after one day at the Somme and you just think to yourself: 'No, it could not be worth it.'
""And that's why I hope and say with Archbishop Eamon that peace has got to be the priority for all of us.""
Young people accompanying the two archbishops and Bishop Denis Nulty, the Catholic bishop of Kildare and Leighlin, and Bishop John McDowell, the Church of Ireland bishop of Clogher, said it is hard to believe the scale of casualties at the Somme.

The FSA has so far been among the rebel groups targeted by Russian strikes which have drawn Western criticism.
Russia is a key ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
It has been bombing targets in Syria since last month and says it is primarily hitting IS positions.
But Western powers say most of the air strikes have hit the FSA and other factions backed by the West and Gulf states.
In a TV interview, Mr Lavrov said that the refusal of the US to co-ordinate their anti-terrorism campaign with Russia had been ""a big mistake"".
The foreign minister said that in addition Russia was ready to support the FSA, but was hampered in doing this because the US was refusing to provide information about rebel and IS positions.
He said that a ""correct understanding"" of developments in war-torn Syria was emerging among Western politicians amid Europe's migrant crisis.
The interview was recorded before talks on Friday with US Secretary of State John Kerry in Vienna. The transcript was released on Saturday.
Mr Kerry said the talks had been ""constructive"" and that an expanded round of negotiations could take place next week.

"The gang allegedly supplied fake Spanish passports to Iranian nationals so they could fly into the UK.
More than 100 people were arrested across Europe, including the suspected ringleader, who was apprehended at London's Heathrow airport.
The operation involved Spain's federal police, London's Metropolitan Police, and European crime agency Europol.
Europol said the group, operating from Malaga in the south of Spain, charged the migrants about €25,000 (£22,500) each for fake Spanish passports, travel documents, transfers and accommodation.
Spanish police said the criminal organisation was 15 people-strong, all of whom had been detained. All were arrested in Malaga, police said, except for the suspected ringleader at Heathrow - who was trying to flee to Brazil.
He was detained on a European arrest warrant.
Forty-two of the people detained were accused of selling their genuine Spanish documents to the criminal group - for anywhere between €300 and €5,000.
Dozens of Iranian nationals were also arrested at European airports, after being found carrying the forged passports.
During the raid in Malaga, police found records of seven Iranian migrants, including a five-year-old child.
They also seized dozens of real passports, computers, printers, more than 400 blank ID cards - as well as guns, cash, and ""a high-end vehicle"".
The year-long investigation began when several Iranians were found in Hamburg, Germany, with a mix of fake and genuine passports, and tickets from a travel agency based in Malaga. That discovery led police to the large-scale smuggling operation.

"The report, commissioned by the BBC Trust, examined how the corporation reflects views from across the UK.
It found the BBC had been ""slow"" to catch up with public opinion on areas such as immigration and the EU.
But former ITV chief Stuart Prebble, who led the review, praised the BBC for an ""impressive breadth of opinion"".
""I have been impressed by the commitment of the BBC's journalists to ensuring that they bring a diversity of voices and viewpoints on a wide range of news stories to audiences across the country,"" he said.
The report found that too much weight is given to the views of politicians and the BBC should find ways to report more ""contentious"" views from people outside Parliament, which would reflect wider public opinion.
Mr Prebble said it was clear ""the BBC cannot afford to rest on its laurels and it should ensure it does all it can to keep up with the ebb and flow of public opinion, which means avoiding over-reliance on Westminster voices, making efforts to find new voices even if they are contentious, and challenging their own assumptions on the accepted consensus.""
The report suggested that the audience of Question Time should be chosen from a wider group, rather than just BBC viewers.
BBC coverage of immigration, religion and the European Union between 2007 and 2012 was examined as part of the study.
On reporting religion, if found there were some gaps in knowledge among some generalist reporters
Mr Prebble said the BBC had not fully reflected concerns about immigration's effect on Britain saying coverage was too often ""dry and clinical"".
He put this down to an over reliance on interviewing politicians, many of whom were reluctant to address the issue.
Mr Prebble's investigation picked up from a 2007 report by John Bridcut, which set out 12 ""guiding principles"" aimed at protecting against biased reporting and ensuring impartiality.
Mr Bridcut's report found that technological and social change had led to a wider range of opinion in society than the traditional right and left wing views.
BBC Trustee David Liddiment said: ""Our impartiality reviews are an important inducement for the Executive to question itself, in this case on its breadth of opinion, to ensure it is doing all it can to achieve what licence fee payers expect and that it is constantly alert to changing public opinion.
""We deliberately chose some complex and controversial subject areas for the review in immigration, religion, and the EU, and our generally positive findings are testament to programme-makers across the corporation.
""It is clear that there is more to do and we will look to the Executive to deliver on this."" he added.

"There has been a row brewing at Westminster for some time over cuts to so-called Short money.
But sources are confident MPs will back a plan that will save 10% from the total in a vote expected on Wednesday.
Ministers say Short money payments are unduly generous given cutbacks elsewhere in the public sector.
In November, George Osborne's Autumn Statement revealed plans to cut the funding - named after former Labour MP Ted Short - by 19%, saying this would be in line with savings expected of unprotected Whitehall departments.
The plans have been strongly criticised by opposition parties.
The proposed compromise would shift the formula for calculating the payments from taking account of the Retail Price Index to instead using the Consumer Price Index.
Over the last 12 months the CPI has grown by a far smaller rate than the RPI - so the switch makes the new formula less generous.
It will necessitate what a source described as ""much greater transparency"" over what the money is spent on.
In addition, it will set a floor below which Short money cannot fall for the smallest parties in the House of Commons - those with between one and five MPs.
That floor is Â£75,000 a year. There is also a ceiling for those parties, of just over Â£200,000.

Analysts and oil bosses have said there is little sign that the downward trend will change, with more US and Russian oil reaching the markets.
Iranian oil supply will also resume in 2016, following the lifting of sanctions.
In November, the 12 members of Opec maintained production at 30 million barrels per day, as first agreed in December 2011.
Many consumers have enjoyed the falling price of fuel in the form of lower petrol prices; several UK supermarkets have begun selling petrol at below Â£1 per litre - which they last did in 2009.
However, oil firms have had profit margins squeezed, forcing them to cut spending in investment and exploration.
Governments of some oil producing countries have also been forced to cut spending as revenue from oil plunges.
The falling price has also led to questions about the merger of energy giants Royal Dutch Shell and BG Group. Earlier this month, David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life Investments, told the BBC that the deal no longer ""makes financial sense"" with the oil price at current levels.","Oil prices have fallen to levels not seen since 2004, surpassing the lows seen during the recession of 2008.",35152037

"All Glamorgan's batsmen reached double figures in a healthy score of 234-4.
But the key contributor was Allenby, who made an unbeaten 74, sharing an unbroken fifth-wicket stand of 84 with Ben Wright (47 not out).
The Australian all-rounder then took 2-18 in eight miserly overs as Hampshire fell short on 203-8 to lose by 31 runs.
The hosts, victorious off the final ball to beat Warwickshire in the final a year ago, had won all their six previous completed List A matches against Glamorgan, an unbeaten run dating back to 2005.
But the underdogs ripped up the formbook, running out comfortable winners over a Hampshire side for whom long-serving former England one-day international Dimitri Mascarenhas was playing his final game.
Hampshire captain Jimmy Adams (59) and Sean Ervine (54) both hit half-centuries, but the hosts fell well short, Glamorgan fast bowler Michael Hogan ending with 4-51.
In what will be his final act as coach, having not had his contract renewed, Matthew Mott's side will now face the winners of Monday evening's second semi-final between Nottinghamshire and Somerset at Lord's on 21 September.
It will be Glamorgan's first trip to St John's Wood for a one-day final since being beaten by Gloucestershire in the 2000 Benson & Hedges Cup - and only the third in their history, having twice ended up losers.
Glamorgan's progress had been unremarkable until the last four overs when they called a belated powerplay, allowing Allenby and Wright to smash 57 off Chris Wood and Sohail Tanvir.
Hampshire immediately missed the big-hitting of England squad opener Michael Carberry and, despite making a healthy enough start with 40-0 from the first eight overs, soon began to fall behind the run rate after the loss of James Vince.
There was still hope with his fellow opener Adams at the crease but a mix-up over a possible single led to the dangerous Neil McKenzie being run out.
And, although Adams and Ervine each passed 50, the required rate rose to above 10 an over.
Hogan, who has been such an inspirational signing this year, then finished Hampshire off when he came back for his final spell.

"Some 1,279 locations were identified and closed in 2012/13, according to its Waste Crime Report.
However, construction waste continues to be a problem, while scrap cars were found at a quarter of all illegal sites.
And the number of successful prosecutions was down by 30%.
The legitimate waste and recycling industry currently generates over Â£12bn every year in the UK, and employs about 128,000 people.
Illegal operators, on the other hand, usually offer to dispose of waste at extremely low prices, and are said to be diverting up to Â£1bn per year from legitimate businesses.
Often the waste is buried or burned with no safeguards for the environment. As well as infestations of flies and acrid smoke, it can lead to serious pollution incidents.
While local authorities deal with most cases of fly-tipping, the Environment Agency deals with larger-scale dumping and illegal exports of waste.
Two years ago, it set up an illegal waste taskforce. Its latest report states that, over the past 12 months, it closed down an average of 25 of these sites every week.
""We've shut more sites down faster than ever,"" said Mat Crocker, head of waste at the agency.
""We put additional resources to it, we got more people in with the right skill sets, and we've also targeted our efforts at the right people so we can deal with it faster.""
While the number of sites being closed down is at record levels, the number of successful prosecutions for waste crime is down to its lowest level in four years.
In 2102/13, 171 prosecutions were completed, leading to five custodial sentences. In 2011/12, there were 249 prosecutions with 10 ending in jail terms.
""We target our prosecutions at the most serious offenders,"" Mat Crocker explained. ""Quite often by providing clear information and following it up with the right type of encouragement, people stop.
""Prosecution is just one of the tools in the bag, really.""
One feature of large-scale waste business is that dumpers are often clustered around key motorway links near London and in the North West.
The agency identified 820 active sites in March this year - the vast majority around these pivotal transport routes.
It also carried out inspections on shipping containers in an attempt to curb the illegal export of waste.

"Titled Hahn/Cock, the 4.72m high piece is by German artist Katharina Fritsch and will be on display for 18 months.
Saturated in intense ultramarine blue, the sculpture was unveiled by Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, on Thursday.
It replaces a 4.1m high bronze of a boy on a rocking horse that had been on the plinth since February 2012.
By Rebecca JonesArts correspondent, BBC News
A big blue cock positively invites double entendres. And the opportunity was not lost on the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, as he unveiled the latest sculpture on the Fourth Plinth.
Despite saying he wouldn't lapse into the art criticism of Viz character Finbarr Saunders, that didn't stop him wondering how long the ""wonderful creature"" was going to stay up. (The answer, by the way, is 18 months.)
You certainly cannot miss it. Painted a deep, matt electric blue, it adds a spot of vibrant colour to Trafalgar Square. Surrounded by bronze statues of Kings and Generals, there is a kind of joyful aspect to it which will put a smile on many people's faces.
The public sculpture, said Mr Johnson, ""doesn't just show that we're the sporting capital, but we are also the artistic and cultural capital of the world"".
He also said he would try and avoid any double entendres when talking about the cockerel.
""It is a ginormous blue Hahn Cock, as it's called,"" he told BBC London.
""I think if you tried to Google it in the future, the Prime Minister would stop you from finding it"" - a reference to David Cameron's proposals to have internet pornography blocked by internet providers.
One London-based conservation group had tried to stop the cockerel - a traditional emblem of France - from being displayed.
Trafalgar Square takes its name from the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar, one of Britain's most significant naval victories in the Napoleonic Wars.
The Thorney Island Society wrote to Westminster Council in protest, branding the sculpture ""totally inappropriate"".
But Justine Simons, director of the Fourth Plinth programme, said she was confident it would be a popular addition.
""We really love the striking vivid blue colour and also the character is really interesting,"" she told BBC London.
""It's an everyday kind of object - this regular domestic cockerel with a twist. The artist has supersized it.
""It will be as big as a London bus and she's made it this striking blue colour, so it will be familiar but also quite surreal.""
Many leading artists have bid to have their work displayed on the Fourth Plinth over the last seven years.
The first sculpture to occupy it was Mark Wallinger's Ecce Homo, a marble sculpture of a human-scale Jesus.
Others have included a statue of a naked, pregnant woman with no arms and Antony Gormley's One & Other, where members of the public occupied the plinth for an hour at a time.","The new artwork for the Fourth Plinth in London's Trafalgar Square, a bright blue cockerel symbolising regeneration and strength, has been unveiled.",23448832

"These beautiful pictures are the first ever taken of a wild lioness nursing a cub from a different species - an extremely rare event.
The pair were spotted by Joop Van Der Linde, a guest at Ndutu Safari Lodge in Tanzania's Ngorongoro Conservation Area.
The scene is the Serengeti; the attentive mother, five-year-old Nosikitok.
The lioness has a GPS collar fitted by Kope Lion, a conservation NGO, and three young cubs of her own - born around the 27-28 June.
Dr Luke Hunter, President and Chief Conservation Officer for Panthera, a global wild cat conservation organisation which supports Kope Lion, told the BBC the incident was ""truly unique"".
""It's not something that I'm aware has ever happened before between large cats like this,"" he said.
""We know there are cases where lionesses will adopt other lion cubs... But this is unprecedented.
""I know of no other case - between any large cat, for that matter - where the species has adopted or nursed the cub of another species.""
Most lionesses would normally kill a baby leopard if they found one, seeing just another predator in a competitive food-chain.
Dr Hunter says Nosikitok has cubs the same age as the young leopard - two to three weeks.
She was around a kilometre from her den, where her own cubs are hidden, when she found the spotted substitute.
""She's encountered this little cub, and she's treated it as her own. She's awash with maternal hormones, and this fierce, protective drive that all lionesses have - they're formidable mums,"" the lion expert notes.
It is not clear yet where the baby leopard's mother is, or if the lioness will try to adopt it full-time.
The local safari lodge say there is a resident female leopard there who almost certainly has cubs. And as Nosikitok's pride are unlikely to prove as indulgent as she is, the best outcome for the leopard would be a safe return to mum.
Dr Hunter says his team are on tenterhooks to see what comes next.
""It's a unique thing, it will be fascinating to see how it unfolds. Nature is unpredictable. Up until earlier this week, we would have said 'Nah, that never happens' - and now it happens!""","A baby leopard can't change his spots, but this lioness doesn't seem to mind.",40603065
"The whistle-blowing website says it has obtained more than 250,000 cables passed between the US State Department and hundreds of American diplomatic outposts - but it has so far only published a small sample of those messages.
However, the entire archive of the reports from US diplomats out in the field has been made available to five publications - the New York Times, the Guardian in the UK, France's Leâ€‰Monde, El PaÃ­s in Spain and Germany's Der Spiegel.
It is the third mass Wikileaks release of classified documents since the publication of 77,000 secret US files on the Afghan conflict in July, and 400,000 documents about the Iraq war in October.
Suspicion has again fallen on US Army private Bradley Manning, an intelligence analyst arrested in Iraq in June and charged over an earlier leak.
In July the US Department of State revealed he had access to the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (Siprnet) - a system which allows government and diplomatic information to be shared.
Wikileaks says the material it has obtained will be released in stages over the next few months because, ""the subject matter of these cables is of such importance, and the geographical spread so broad, that to do otherwise would not do this material justice"".
The full batch consists of 251,287 documents, comprising 261,276,536 words - which the website says is seven times the size of its Iraq documents release.
The cables cover messages sent between 1966 and 2010 and originate from 274 US embassies, consulates and diplomatic missions, the website says.
The New York Times, in a note to readers on its website, says the group of five US and European papers that gained access to the diplomatic material have been trawling through it for several weeks and agreed to begin publication of articles based on the cables on Sunday.
Defending the release of the documents, the paper argues they ""serve an important public interest, illuminating the goals, successes, compromises and frustrations of American diplomacy in a way that other accounts cannot match"".
White House 'consulted'
About 11,000 of the cables are marked ""secret"", the paper says, with another 9,000 carrying the label ""noforn"" - meaning they should not to be shared with other countries - and 4,000 marked ""secret/noforn"". The rest are said to be ""confidential"" or unclassified.
But the Times also reveals it has excluded information that it believes would endanger informants or national security. It has also consulted the Obama administration over some of the content, it says.
About 100 cables - some edited, some in full - will be published on its website, the paper adds.
In the UK, the Guardian also says it does not intend to ""dump"" the entire database into the public domain or to publish names that would endanger the safety of individuals.
""The news organisations have redacted some of the cables in order to protect a number of named sources and so as not to disclose certain details of current special operations,"" the paper says in a note from editors. ""We have shared our redactions with Wikileaks.""
The Guardian, which says it was given the contents of the leaked cables on a memory stick, also explains it will not be reporting on certain cables at all ""owing to the nature of sourcing or subject matter"".

The Swiss will begin his bid for an eighth Wimbledon singles title later this month.

"Mumtaz Qadri killed Salman Taseer in Islamabad in 2011, in a murder that shocked the country.
Qadri was hailed as a hero by some Islamist groups, and thousands of hard-line activists protested to show their support for him at the time.
After news of his execution, crowds again took to the streets in protest.
Security forces have been put on high alert and a heavy police presence, including riot police, are in place in the area around Qadri's home in Islamabad, AFP news agency reports.
His funeral will be held on Tuesday at Liaquat Bagh park in nearby Rawalpindi, where large numbers of mourners are expected.
Prison officials said Qadri was executed at 04:30 local time (23:30 GMT) at Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, near the capital, Islamabad.
What are Pakistan's blasphemy laws?
Qadri, who had trained as an elite police commando and was assigned to Taseer as his bodyguard, shot the politician at an Islamabad market in January 2011. He was sentenced to death later that year.
He claimed it was his religious duty to kill the minister, who was an outspoken critic of Pakistan's harsh blasphemy laws and supported liberal reforms.
Analysis: M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad
Mumtaz Qadri's hanging has come as a surprise to many who thought such a move could spark a severe backlash from the religious lobby.
The hanging comes amid two recent developments that have already incensed religious groups.
In January, the Punjab government banned preaching in educational institutions by Tablighi Jamaat, a proselytising and revivalist movement. And earlier this month it enacted a law that provides for a helpline for women to report abuses by their husbands and others.
Amid this atmosphere, the move to hang Qadri indicates a growing confidence of the government in taming the street power of religious groups, which the military has long been accused of using to control politicians at home and fight its proxy wars abroad.
One reason may be the fact that most hard-line groups adhere to the Deobandi school and would be loath to lionise Qadri, an adherent of the rival Barelvi sect. But a more important reason seems to be the military's new-found willingness to curb militant groups that have a domestic agenda.
Pakistan has seen Islamist groups grow in influence in recent years and several high profile blasphemy cases.
Qadri was lauded by religious conservatives, and in his first court appearance was showered with rose petals by supporters. He never expressed any regret for the killing. His brother appeared to reassert that when he told the AFP news agency about his final meeting with Qadri.
""I have no regrets,"" Malik Abid told AFP. ""We started crying, but he hugged us and chanted 'God is great,'"" he added.
In May, just months after Taseer was gunned down, Pakistan's Minorities Minister Shahbaz Bhatti, the cabinet's only Christian, was shot dead by gunmen who ambushed his car.
That August, Salman Taseer's son, Shahbaz Taseer, was abducted in Lahore. His whereabouts are still unclear.
Blasphemy is an extremely sensitive issue in Pakistan and critics argue that blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal scores and unfairly target minorities.

"Former West Bromwich Albion, Notts County and England striker Astle died in 2002, aged 59, from a brain condition normally linked to boxing.
Head of performance services Dave Reddin said the FA had previously been slow to act in head-injury research.
The Premier League brought in new regulations for its clubs in August.
But grassroots football has had less guidance from the FA.
Reddin said: ""I've just reconstituted an expert panel who are going to advise us on the likely research that can take place and also help us review and update our concussion guidelines.
""We're still making sure that the grassroots guidelines are not just correct but also practical to implement at that level.
""We could have been faster but I think what's important is that we get it right before they go out.""
Alex Roome, a youth coach at East Midlands Counties Football League club Ashby Ivanhoe, told Inside Out East Midlands he had to find out himself what to do when he had a concussion.
""I had concussion as a player once so obviously I'm aware of it but as regards to guidance from the FA or anything like that, no,"" he said. ""No-one is actually explaining it to you.
""I've headed the ball before and I can't imagine it's very dissimilar to being hit by a boxing glove so why should football be any different?""
A coroner ruled Astle suffered repeated concussions after heading heavy leather footballs during his career.
The FA agreed to carry out research into head injuries in football after chairman Greg Dyke met the family of Astle, following a long-running campaign.
Astle's daughter Dawn said football should look after its past.
""We felt that football didn't care, that he died as a result of being a footballer,"" she said.

"The head of the Sinaloa cartel was extradited from Mexico on Thursday.
US prosecutors want an order to seize $14bn (Â£11.3bn) of his assets.
In 2015, Mr Guzman famously escaped from a high-security prison through a tunnel - while being recorded on CCTV. He had fought against extradition since his recapture in early 2016.
Federal authorities have sought Mr Guzman for more than 20 years. He faces 17 charges including drug trafficking, illegal firearms use, money laundering, and smuggling cash across the border.
Ahead of his first appearance in a New York court, prosecutors revealed that they would seek the civil forfeiture of Mr Guzman's assets to the amount of $14bn - an indication of the extent of his empire.
""He's a man known for no other life than a life of crime, violence, death and destruction. And now he'll have to answer to that. That's who Chapo Guzman is,"" said US attorney Robert Capers.
If convicted, Mr Guzman faces a mandatory life sentence.
Mr Capers also revealed that prosecutors were not aware the extradition was happening in advance.
""Guzman's story is not one of a do-gooder or a Robin Hood or even one of a famous escape artist who miraculously escaped from Mexican prisons on multiple occasions,"" he said.
""Guzman's destructive and murderous rise as an international narcotics trafficker is akin to that of a small cancerous tumour that metastasized and grew into a full blown scourge.""
His ability to evade capture made Mr Guzman stand out from other drug gang leaders.
His first high profile escape was in 2001 when it was reported - despite some doubts - that he had escaped from a maximum security prison by hiding in a laundry basket.
He was recaptured thirteen years later. But in 2015, he walked out of his cell through a cleanly-dug tunnel, while under video surveillance.
Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto had initially resisted extraditing the cartel leader to the US, insisting that he should face justice at home.
But after Mr Guzman was recaptured in January 2016, Pena Nieto changed his mind on extradition and ordered officials to speed up the process.

Reselling tickets at inflated prices is common for sold-out gigs and is not illegal. But it often causes consternation among genuine fans and the site says: ""The resale of tickets will not be tolerated.""
The tour announcement came after 25 set a new record for the most albums sold in a UK chart week, overtaking the previous record of 696,000 set by Oasis's Be Here Now in 1997.
However the Oasis album only went on sale three days before the end of the chart week, whereas Adele has notched up her total in six days.
Sales of Adele's third album far outstrip those of any other release in recent years. No other artist has even sold 100,000 copies in a single week this year.
One Direction came closest when their LP Made in the AM sold 93,000 last month - including more than 7,000 from streaming data, which Adele does not have because 25 is not available on streaming services.

"The Chiefs, who host third-placed Wasps in the last four, also denied Quins a place in the top six following wins for Northampton Saints and Sale Sharks.
Exeter, who had been 17-10 up at half-time, ran riot in the second half as the Harlequins defence fell apart.
Henry Slade starred at centre, while wing Jack Nowell scored a hat-trick.
Dave Ewers, Phil Dollman, Will Chudley and Julian Salvi also crossed for the Chiefs, while James Short's brace and Slade's well-deserved score capped an emphatic display of attacking rugby at The Stoop.
For all of Exeter's style and panache, the second-half collapse of Quins will greatly concern director of rugby Conor O'Shea ahead of their European Challenge Cup final against Montpellier next Friday.
O'Shea, who was leading the team at The Stoop for the last time before becoming head coach of Italy, now has just six days to pick his players up for his swansong in Lyon.
The one saving grace for Harlequins is that, if they are able to lift the Challenge Cup next week, they will still secure a spot in next season's Champions Cup.
Danny Care's try on the stroke of half-time had kept the hosts in contention against Exeter, but the Chiefs were too strong after the break, despite further scores from Kyle Sinckler and Winston Stanley.
Exeter, who had never finished higher than fifth before this season, are now two wins away from lifting their first top-flight title.
Centre Slade and wing Nowell are likely to hold the key if they are to get past Wasps and reach the final at Twickenham, with both also looking strong contenders to start for England during the summer tour of Australia.
The fine form of Slade, whose brilliant offload to Short and arrowed pass for Nowell set up Exeter's first two tries, will be particularly pleasing for national coach Eddie Jones, after the 23-year-old was forced to miss much of this season with a broken leg.
Harlequins director of rugby Conor O'Shea:
""In my first full season here we finished seventh and won the Challenge Cup, so hopefully we can bookmark and finish seventh and win the Challenge Cup. But between now and next Friday no one will give us a chance.
""It's gut-wrenching to see a team play so far below what they have and they can. That's the hard part.
""We have a good group of players, I know my image of this group isn't what happened out there but it's the image we have to carry with us into the summer, unless we can show the steel of sports people.""
Exeter Chiefs head coach Rob Baxter:
""If a semi-final at home at Sandy Park doesn't bring our best game of the season out of us then we probably don't deserve to be there.
""That's very much what I'll say to the players - let's be prepared to play the best game we've played because the occasion deserves it. We go there looking on good form both try scoring and defensively.""

"Attracting long-haul destinations has been one of the aims of the airport as part of its growth strategy.
It already has flights to Orlando in Florida and now Qatar Airlines will fly to Doha, Qatar's capital, from 2018.
More than 1.3 million people used the airport in the Vale of Glamorgan in 2016 - a 16% growth in passenger numbers.
Deb Barber, chief executive of Cardiff Airport, said: ""It is fantastic that we will now be able to offer our customers more choice of travel with a world-class airline providing easy connections to destinations across the world.""
Via its hub at Hamad International Airport, Qatar Airways connects to destinations including Australia, Thailand and China.
Ms Barber added: ""It has been a long journey to get to this stage, with discussions spanning a number of years.
""Over the coming months we will work with the team at Qatar Airways to confirm the details of the service and look forward to the flights being on sale in the near future.""

Analysis from Sarah Dickins, BBC Wales economics correspondent
The new direct route from Cardiff to Doha is a reminder not just that the economy of Qatar is growing significantly but also that trade between Wales, the Arab world and beyond is increasing.
Figures released this month show that in 2016 exports from Wales to Qatar amounted to £26m. They are expected to grow further as Welsh businesses attempt to find new markets outside the European Union.
But Doha airport already attracts much more business than just from those visiting Qatar.
The state airline is a growing hub for the region and further east. Welsh exports to that wider area are significant. In 2016, businesses sold goods and services worth £281m to the Middle East and North Africa and worth more than £1bn to Asia and Oceania.
It is not just about business. Tourism to Doha itself is rising - it grew by 11.5% between 2010 and 2015 and will be under the spotlight as it prepares to host the Fifa World Cup in 2022.
Cardiff Airport was bought by the Welsh Government in 2013 for £52m following a slump in passenger numbers.
But it has ambitious targets of reaching three million passengers a year and a replacement terminal in the long term.
Roger Lewis, Cardiff Airport chairman, called the Qatar Airlines tie-up a ""game changing announcement"" for the airport and for Wales.
""The benefits of this relationship will be transformational for both businesses and passengers across the south west of England and for Wales,"" he added.
First Minister Carwyn Jones, who will be in Qatar next weekend to discuss potential investment opportunities, added:  ""This new route, and the relationship between Cardiff Airport and Qatar Airways, will open-up Wales' links with the rest of the world and deliver new economic, leisure and travel opportunities for Welsh businesses and the people of Wales.""
Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns, who recently met senior managers at Qatar Airways to make the case for a service from Wales, added: ""This new route will send a positive message about an outward looking Wales developing international trade and tourism links to the rest of the world.""

"The clinicians say there are plans to centralise trauma care in Edinburgh and Glasgow.
They argue this would downgrade Aberdeen and jeopardise patient care.
However, the Scottish government insisted all options were still on the table.
Two years ago, plans were unveiled to create four 'major trauma centres' which would provide specialist care to people with the most serious injuries, such as car crash victims.
The Scottish government had said those centres would be based in Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow.
However, in a letter, 57 clinicians involved in trauma care in Aberdeen said that only two trauma centres were now being proposed - Edinburgh and Glasgow.
A decision on which hospitals would achieve the status of a major trauma centre is due shortly after the election.
Health Secretary Shona Robison said: ""These claims are simply not true. No final decisions about the number of trauma centres have been made.
""All options remain on the table and I am today writing to the National Planning Forum to give reassurances to clinicians on this.
""Clinicians and planners from across Scotland, including Aberdeen, are currently working closely together on what Scotland's major trauma network should look like so we can provide the best model for the people of Scotland.
""I hope everyone can get behind this important work, so we can make sure we have the best possible solution.""
She explained: ""We estimate that an additional 40 lives a year can be saved, with many thousands benefiting, from the enhanced care that a major trauma network offers.
""However, in order to achieve this, it is extremely important we get the model of care right, in particular taking into account the geography of Scotland and the more remote and rural areas.
""I can absolutely guarantee that clinicians from all four proposed major trauma sites have been involved in this work from the outset - and will continue to be absolutely central to informing  the decisions we take.""
Labour MSP Lewis Macdonald said that meetings were held with staff last week in which it was clear that only sites in Glasgow and Edinburgh were being considered, despite the fact Aberdeen Royal Infirmary had more facilities on a single site than Edinburgh.
Lib Dem MSP Alison McInnes said the SNP must ""come clean"" on its plans as the electorate deserved to know what they were voting for ahead of the May election.
Scottish Conservative health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: ""Things have to become pretty serious for 50 respected clinicians to break their silence and alert the public of their considerable alarm over this potential outcome for the North East.
""It's not good enough to have a national trauma plan which only services the central belt and for this to be the only proposal on offer.""
An NHS Grampian spokesperson said: ""We fully recognise and understand the strength of feeling about Aberdeen Royal Infirmary being a Major Trauma Centre (MTC) in a north of Scotland network.
""NHS Grampian's position has been quite clear.  Over the last 18 months we have been preparing to be a MTC with the full support of the board.
""Our clinicians and managers are participating fully in the work of the National Planning Forum.

"Panic founder Steven Frank admitted in a blog post that it happened after he downloaded an infected copy of the video encoding tool Handbrake.
He said there was no sign that any customer data was accessed and that Panic's web server was not affected.
Users have been warned to download Panic's apps only from its website or the Apple App Store.
Panic is the creator of web editing and file transfer apps Coda and Transmit, and the video game Firewatch.
On 2 May Handbrake was hacked, with the Mac version of the app on one of the site's download servers replaced by a malicious copy.
The infected app was discovered and removed on 6 May.
In what Mr Frank called ""a case of extraordinarily bad luck"", he downloaded the malicious version of Handbrake and launched it ""without stopping to wonder why Handbrake would need admin privilegesâ€¦ when it hadn't before"".
""And that was that, my Mac was completely, entirely compromised in three seconds or less.""
The attacker then used his password to access other private files and copy the source code for several of Panic's products stored on the infected computer.
The theft was confirmed when Panic received an email containing some of the files and demanding a ransom for the return of the complete code.
""We're working on the assumption that there's no point in paying,"" Mr Frank wrote, saying that ""the attacker has no reason to keep their end of the bargain"".

"ComRes researchers for BBC Newsround interviewed 750 10- and 11-year-olds who will be taking Key Stage Two Sats tests this week.
More than half (59%) said they felt some pressure to do well while (28%) felt ""a lot of pressure"".
The government says the tests need not be stressful and rigorous testing helps raise standards in schools.
In the survey carried out last month, children were asked to pick a variety of words describing their mood in the run-up to the tests:
But most were not unduly distressed, with almost half (48%) saying they did not mind taking the tests and an additional 14% saying they enjoyed them.
Some of the more positive words children used to describe their feelings about tests were:
Only 10% said they hated taking exams.
But 32% said they worried more about schoolwork when they had tests coming up and 25% said they found it hard to concentrate.
Last Tuesday some parents kept their children off school in a day of protest about primary tests in England - and more than 40,000 signed a petition calling for a boycott.
The protest, organised by the Let Our Kids Be Kids campaign, complained of a damaging culture of over-testing, saying children are ""over-tested, over-worked and in a school system that places more importance on test results and league tables than children's happiness and joy of learning"".
They raised concerns about the impact of primary tests, so-called Sats tests, taken by seven-year-olds and 11-year-olds, which are being made more stretching with changes to the curriculum.
Natasha Devon, the government's former mental health champion for schools, whose job was axed last week, has also emphasised the level of mental strain being put on pupils by rigorous testing.
A Department for Education spokesman said the tests should not be stressful ""and we know that good schools manage them appropriately"".
The spokesman said that tests at the end of primary school ""help teachers understand how pupils are doing and identify where additional support is needed, as well as helping us make sure schools are doing well.
""They are a key part of making sure young people master the skills they need to reach their potential and succeed in life.
""As a government we recently asked young people what we could do to help them support their friends better. More than 1,700 young people gave their views and we will be investing Â£1.5m in peer support based on what they have told us.

"Frances Cappuccini, 30, died after losing 2.3 litres of blood at Tunbridge Wells Hospital in Kent.
Obstetrics expert Dr David Bogod told the hearing the on-call consultant anaesthetist would be ""essential"".
He said he had looked into the case for three and a half years but still ""couldn't work out"" who that was.
Mrs Cappuccini, a primary school teacher, died several hours after giving birth to her second son Giacomo on 9 October 2012.
The inquest was told how after the surgery she had lost 1.7 litres of blood by 10:40 BST.
The family's lawyer Neil Sheldon asked Dr Bogod: ""It would appear nobody contacted the on-call consultant anaesthetist until 13:30 - do you find that surprising?""
Dr Bogod replied: ""What I find more surprising is I still don't know who the consultant anaesthetist was.""
Earlier in the week Mrs Cappuccini's husband Tom told the inquest she endured a 12-hour labour after hospital staff refused an elective Caesarean section.
On Wednesday senior registrar Gabriella Gray said the patient lost 2.3 litres of blood and she was twice alerted to stop the bleeding.
Dr Gray accepted no consultant obstetrician was with Mrs Cappuccini for a time between the alerts but said she considered the mother had had a stable blood flow.
The patient received one litre of fluid replacement despite losing more than two litres of blood. Dr Gray said she had not departed from trust guidelines.

"Afzal Amin is accused of attempting a plot with the English Defence League in which they would announce a march in the Dudley North constituency and he would take credit when it was scrapped.
Mr Amin, who denies any wrongdoing, faces a party hearing on Tuesday.
He told BBC Radio 4's Today he would make a ""robust defence"" of his actions.
But the Conservative source said it would be hard to justify talks with the EDL.
Mr Amin is likely to be gone within 48 hours and a replacement could be chosen by the weekend, the source added.
The marginal seat of Dudley North is currently held by Labour's Ian Austin with a majority of 649.
A Conservative spokesman said Mr Amin had been suspended from the party and as a candidate ""with immediate effect"" following the allegations.
Afzal Amin's actions have left senior Conservatives incredulous.
He will have an opportunity to account for himself at a meeting tomorrow, but there is little doubt about his fate.
One senior figure said it was impossible to see how the suspended candidate could say anything that might justify holding talks with the English Defence League.
Mr Amin has told the BBC he sought to bring people together, and denied deception, but he is likely to be gone within 48 hours; a replacement could be chosen by the weekend.
Ending his political career may be short work - restoring the standing of the Conservative party in the crucial marginal of Labour-held Dudley North could take much longer. And a new candidate would have very little time.
For Conservatives anxious about their party's standing in ethnic minority communities this has been a difficult and ill-timed story.
The Mail on Sunday claims secretly-filmed footage, obtained by former EDL leader Tommy Robinson, shows former Army captain Mr Amin promising to be an ""unshakeable ally"" for the EDL in parliament and help bring their views to the mainstream.
Mr Amin said the allegations were ""an inaccurate picture of the reality"" and told the BBC his idea would have been a ""catalyst to bring people together"".
He said tensions in Dudley had increased over plans for a new mosque, prompting him to speak with Muslim leaders and EDL members, including Tommy Robinson.
And he told Today his actions had been ""very normal conflict resolution, confidence building measures"".
He added: ""If people do announce that we are going to do an action and other people disagree with it, then they sit together and they resolve their differences and the action is then stopped.
""Then this helps the communities to feel that yes, on the other side there is a working partner we can work with. And that's what we were trying to stage-manage.""
He said the EDL suggested the march and claimed he would not have the ""confidence"" to bring the idea forward himself.
But Mr Robinson said the recordings made clear what had happened.
""What he needs to do is be honest"", Mr Robinson said.
Defence minister Anna Soubry appealed on BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday for Mr Amin to ""go now"" if there was any truth to the accusations.","A suspended Conservative election candidate is likely to be removed from the party within days, a senior Conservative source has told the BBC.",32013025
"The BBC, CNN, the New York Times and others were excluded from an audience with Press Secretary Sean Spicer, with no reason given.
It came hours after President Donald Trump delivered another attack on the media in a speech, saying that ""fake news"" was the ""enemy of the people"".
He has previously singled out CNN and the New York Times for criticism.
Recent reports claiming his campaign aides had contact with Russian intelligence officials have particularly irked the president.
Shortly after Mr Trump's speech on Friday, a number of selected media organisations were invited into Mr Spicer's office for an informal briefing, or ""gaggle"".
Those allowed into the room included ABC, Fox News, Breitbart News, Reuters and the Washington Times.
When asked why some were excluded, Mr Spicer said it was his decision to ""expand the pool"" of reporters.
He also warned the White House was going to ""aggressively push back"" at ""false narratives"" in the news.
Politico, Buzzfeed and the Daily Mail were also left out, but CNN was the only major US television network to be denied entry.
The Associated Press, USA Today and Time magazine refused to attend as a protest.
The BBC's bureau chief in Washington, Paul Danahar, said the BBC has a representative at every daily White House briefing and it was not clear why they were barred from Friday's session.
New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet said it was the first time such an exclusion had happened in the newspaper's history.
A White House spokeswoman said they had invited a group which included all journalists in the press pool, which shares information with other reporters
""We decided to add a couple of additional people beyond the pool. Nothing more than that,"" Sarah Sanders said.
During the briefing, Mr Spicer addressed reports that White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus had asked the FBI to publicly dispute media stories about contacts between the Trump campaign and Moscow.
He said Mr Priebus had little choice but to seek assistance in rejecting what Mr Spicer said were inaccurate reports. The FBI did not issue the statement requested.
Mr Trump has been dogged by claims of alleged links to Moscow since his presidential campaign.

"Wasps, who will start playing games at the Ricoh Arena from December, say they understand it is a sensitive time and have attempted to address supporters' concerns on their website.
Alexander Hayton has supported Wasps since 1998, when he was 10 years old.
""It feels very much that as a fanbase we've been abused,"" he told BBC Sport.
""There's a loyalty the fans have shown the club the last few seasons. As far as I'm concerned loyalty swings both ways.
""I will never support another club. Once a Wasp, always a Wasp. But my time of regularly attending home games is over unfortunately.""

Wasps completed a deal to buy a 50% share in the Ricoh Arena on Tuesday and say the move ""gives the club the best opportunity to thrive as a business, which will support further investment in the squad"".
""It's sad to leave London but there was no other choice. You can't sustain a business on gates of 5,000,"" said Wasps captain James Haskell.

"Under the proposals, hosts renting out entire properties will be notified as they approach the limit and given details of where to seek an extension.
The announcement brings the home-sharing website into line with UK law.
The move, which comes into effect from Spring 2017, follows concerns that short-term lets were fuelling a London housing crisis.
Tom Copley, Labour's housing spokesman on the London assembly, called the move a ""huge step in the right direction"".
It is already against the law for landlords to let out their homes on short term lets for more than 90 days without planning permission.
According to Mr Copley, councils did not have the resources or data to enforce the law.
A similar scheme has been agreed in Amsterdam which has a 60-day limit for most short-term rentals.
In a statement the company, which has been valued at Â£24bn, said: ""We want to be good partners to London... and ensure home-sharing grows responsibly and sustainably.""

"The nine-year-old will miss the race for the second year in a row, this time with a stress fracture diagnosed after withdrawing from January's Irish Champion Hurdle, which he won in 2016.
Trainer Willie Mullins also said Min will miss the festival with an injury.
""We had hoped Faugheen had just tweaked a muscle, but we've had it checked out and it's a stress fracture,"" he said.
""Min has a bruise. Hopefully both will still make the track this season.""
Faugheen was unable to defend his Cheltenham crown because of an injury picked up after winning the Irish Champion Hurdle.
Cornelius Lysaght, BBC horse racing correspondent
The absence of Faugheen and Min is a huge blow to Mullins and his supporters, especially coming in a season where things have not been going as swimmingly as everyone has got used to.
But the sheer strength in depth that Mullins has under his care means he remains favourite to be top trainer at Cheltenham - and a glance at some of those that remain on course tells you why.

"They won the Carling Cup on penalties in February but were beaten 2-1 by Chelsea in an FA Cup final in which they were criticised for a slow start.
I thought Carroll's header went in but if it hasn't then give the officials the credit they deserve
""They've been in two cup finals in this season - they'll have enjoyed the first one more than the second,"" he said.
""The lads will benefit from the experience. You can't give a team like Chelsea a two-goal head start.""
Many observers were surprised by Liverpool's lack of adventure in the opening hour of the Wembley showpiece and it was only the introduction of combative £35m striker Andy Carroll after 55 minutes that ignited their performance.
Carroll lashed home from inside the area less than 10 minutes after entering the fray and Liverpool pressed in the closing stages, only for Chelsea to hang on for a fourth FA Cup final triumph in the last six seasons.
""They were the best team for the first hour but we finished strongly and maybe if we'd started that way we'd be happier than we are now,"" Dalglish admitted.
It briefly appeared as if the game would be dominated by debate over whether the ball had crossed the line, much as Chelsea's semi-final with Tottenham had been last month.
Home: Won 5, Drawn 9, Lost 4
Away: Won 8, Drawn 1, Lost 9
Carroll was convinced his header had gone over before it was acrobatically clawed out by Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech, but referee Phil Dowd did not award a goal and replays suggested the right decision had been made.
""I thought it went in but if it hasn't then give the officials the credit they deserve,"" Dalglish said.
""We've just got to learn our lessons from it and understand we can't start the game like that.""
Asked about his team's modest league campaign in which they have lost 13 of 36 games and scored only 43 goals, Dalglish added: ""We'll assess the season at the end of the season.""
Carroll said of the 'goal that never was': ""I thought it was over the line and you know better than me but I thought it was. I thought it hit the other side of the bar but I haven't seen it back.
""I had a few chances and could have put them away but it wasn't to be. We came here to win, it's been disappointing in the league, we got here and it was unlucky because it would have taken us into extra time. I did the best I could when I came on and we were unlucky.""",Liverpool boss Kenny Dalglish says his players will improve following their two Wembley cup finals this season.,17971918

But Gillingham were level just two minutes later when the ball deflected into the path of Bradley Dack, who cut inside before finishing neatly into the bottom corner.
The hosts then went ahead when Josh Wright's shot from Ryan Jackson's cut-back deflected in off Josh Parker, with Dons goalkeeper James Shea furious the goal not disallowed for offside.

"The 23-year-old left-hander was injured during the Championship match against Lancashire at Old Trafford on Tuesday.
It came only hours after he was named in the England senior Test squad to play Pakistan next month.
Meanwhile, key batsman Kumar Sangakkara believes handling the occasion will be key for Surrey at Lord's.
The Brown Caps are aiming to win their first one-day trophy since lifting the CB40 title at Lord's in 2011.
""The key for us is to enjoy the day; forget that it is a final, forget that it is Lord's and not to get overawed,"" Sangakkara told BBC London 94.9.
""We need to appreciate what has brought us there and be able to repeat it.""
Sri Lanka legend Sangakkara has been crucial to Surrey's progress to the final, hitting 166 in the semi-final win over Nottinghamshire and scoring 429 runs at an average of 61.28 throughout the tournament.
However, he was keen to stress that Surrey's young side, which has also secured promotion from Division Two of the County Championship, has made solid progress this year.
""Whatever the result is, the journey has been wonderful. If we can top it off with a win then it is even better,"" the 37-year-old said.
""The result will not take anything away from the season we have had and the way the players have grown, individuals have blossomed and the team has shown its character.
""We are all looking forward to it. Excitement will heighten but I hope we keep our eyes on the ball and our minds on what we are there to do; execute the basics, execute our skill and trust in each other.

"The bill passed by 168 votes to 123, and had the support of the three parties making up the ruling coalition.
It is part of continuing moves by the centre-right government to cut costs and ensure more bailout money from international creditors.
But it was vociferously opposed by protesters outside parliament.
The new law will overturn what had been a constitutional guarantee for civil servants of a job for life, says the BBC's Mark Lowen in Athens.
The sector has been seen as notoriously bloated since it expanded in the 1970s and 1980s as successive administrations employed their own people, our correspondent adds.
Some 2,000 civil servants will lose their jobs by the end of June, another 2,000 by the end of the year, and a further 11,000 by the end of 2014.
State workers who have broken rules will be targeted for dismissal, but many are expected to be replaced by younger employees in key sectors such as health.
So the law will not slim down the public sector, our correspondent says. That would be achieved by a parallel plan that would see 150,000 state jobs go by the end of 2015, by replacing only some of those who retire.
The law is a condition for Greece to receive its next tranche of loans worth 8.8bn euros (Â£7.4bn; $11.4bn).
Eurozone officials will now meet on Monday to approve the overdue release of 2.8bn euros, said Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras, according to Reuters news agency.
The remaining 6bn euros will be paid on 13 May, he added.
As MPs debated the measures inside parliament, several hundred demonstrators outside took part in a protest called by Adedy, the civil service trade confederation, and the private sector GSEE union.
They were demonstrating against what the unions called ""those politicians who are dismantling the public service and destroying the welfare state"".
Critics say the law, which is part of a larger package of measures, will only add to Greece's record unemployment rate of 27%.
They say many of those who will lose their jobs are older workers already struggling to support their families and make ends meet.
But others say the measures are overdue.
The conservative coalition, led by Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, has 167 seats in the 300-seat parliament so the measure was always expected to pass.
However, there are reports of divisions within his government on some issues and there is speculation he could reshuffle his ministerial team soon.
Eurozone finance ministers are expected to decide on the next instalment of aid for debt-ridden Greece at a meeting on 16 May.
Since 2010, the European Union and the IMF have promised more than 200bn euros in lending for Greece, the first country to be hit by the eurozone crisis.

"The defendants, all of whom are Shia Muslims, were also convicted of forming a terrorist organisation in the Sunni-ruled Gulf kingdom.
All had their citizenship revoked, judicial sources said.
Bahrain has been wracked by unrest since mass Shia-led protests calling for reforms were put down in 2011.
At least 90 people, including at least 18 policemen, have been killed in the ongoing violence.
The 23 were convicted of carrying out the bombings in two Shia villages last December. One of the blasts killed a Jordanian policeman, and the other caused the death of a Bahraini man.
The attacks were the work of the same ""terrorist group"" which ""specialised in making explosives to target policemen"", chief prosecutor Ahmed al-Hammadi said.
The case is the latest in a series of trials, some involving many defendants, in connection with unrest and deadly attacks in the kingdom.

""The settlement is comprehensive and reflects the gravity of the allegations that were wrongly made,"" the corporation said in a statement.
The Tory peer had said it was ""terrifying"" to find himself ""a figure of public hatred"".
Lord McAlpine said: ""I am delighted to have reached a quick and early settlement with the BBC. I have been conscious that any settlement will be paid by the licence fee-payers, and have taken that into account in reaching agreement with the BBC.
""We will now be continuing to seek settlements from other organisations that have published defamatory remarks and individuals who have used Twitter to defame me.""
The terms of the agreement will be announced in court in a few days' time, according to RMPI LLP, solicitors for Lord McAlpine.
Newsnight broadcast a report on child abuse in north Wales care homes earlier this month. Lord McAlpine's name was not broadcast, but he was wrongly identified on the internet.
BBC home editor Mark Easton says the BBC will apologise to Lord McAlpine in court - but Lord McAlpine will also give a statement, in what our correspondent describes as an unusual step.
Lord McAlpine will say in his statement that he still holds the BBC in very high esteem, our correspondent adds.
The BBC has previously apologised for the broadcast, and investigations are being held into the programme, including by the BBC and media watchdog Ofcom.
Lord McAlpine said ""there is nothing as bad as this that you can do to people"" as accusing them of being a paedophile.
""They are quite rightly figures of public hatred - and suddenly to find yourself a figure of public hatred, unjustifiably, is terrifying,"" he added.
Conservative MP Rob Wilson said the settlement will ""incense"" licence fee payers because ""they are paying for a self-inflicted wound"".
He said: ""This is a very expensive lesson for the BBC that it must maintain the highest standards of journalism and fairness at all times.
""The settlement is also expensive and particularly hard on the licence fee payer... unfortunately, a protracted court case may well have cost a great deal more.""
Lord McAlpine's solicitor Andrew Reid had earlier said that Lord McAlpine was ""more than aware that the ultimate people who will paying for any monies that he may receive are in fact the licence payers, the people who really own the BBC, and he is very much aware of this and hence any agreement that is reached is tempered in the light of that.""
The Newsnight report led to director general George Entwistle quitting at the weekend. Acting director general Tim Davie has said he hoped to personally apologise to Lord McAlpine.
Mr Reid has also earlier urged those who had named Lord McAlpine on social media site Twitter to come forward.
He said Sally Bercow, wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow, had not yet been in touch to apologise for her tweets.
She tweeted on Thursday that she maintained her tweet was not libellous, ""just foolish"".
Mr Reid confirmed several prominent people had already apologised.
Ofcom is also investigating ITV's This Morning. It received complaints after presenter Philip Schofield handed the prime minister a list of alleged paedophiles during a live broadcast.

"Earlier this month the court had asked for the numbers during a hearing on the decriminalisation of gay sex in India.
A 2009 Delhi High Court ruling that decriminalised same-sex relationships is being challenged.
Many political, social and religious groups want the 19th Century colonial-era law reinstated.
The figures filed by the Ministry of Health were compiled by India's National Aids Control Programme.
The Aids programme has already reached 200,000 men in same-sex relationships and the hope is to raise that number to 400,000.
The prevalence of HIV in the group is 6.54%-7.23%.
But overall, the number of HIV-infected people in India is just 0.2% of the population as the country's Aids control programme has been successful in reducing the number of new infections.
Last month, the Supreme Court criticised the government for its shifting stand on the issue of decriminalising gay sex.
This was after a senior government lawyer, PP Malhotra, told the court that homosexuality was unnatural and immoral.
Within hours, the home ministry disowned the lawyer's statement and said he had read from an out-of-date file.
The health ministry then stated that it supported the 2009 Delhi High Court order decriminalising gay sex.
Judges GS Singhvi and SJ Mukhopadhyaya criticised the government for not doing its ""homework"" on the case and ordered the government to provide a count of the country's homosexual population for the next hearing.
""You should have done your homework before coming to the court,"" they told an official.
The 2009 ruling decriminalising gay sex was welcomed by India's gay community, which said the judgement would help protect them from harassment and persecution.
Many people in India still regard same-sex relationships as illegitimate, but rights groups have long argued that the law contravened human rights.
Section 377 of the colonial Indian Penal Code defined homosexual acts as ""carnal intercourse against the order of nature"" and made them illegal.
But the Delhi High Court said the law was discriminatory and gay sex between consenting adults should not be treated as a crime. Until the high court ruling, homosexual acts were punishable by a 10-year prison term.","There are about 2.5 million gays in India of whom 7% are HIV-positive, according to figures submitted by the government to the Supreme Court.",17363200
"The annual crime performance statistics for 2015/16, which will go to Tynwald in July, show a total of 257 offences compared with 198 the previous year.

There were about 2,000 crimes recorded during the year - the lowest since the 1970s. Chief Constable Gary Roberts said low crime levels were ""good news"".
Figures show there was a 53% fall in burglaries, an 18% drop in criminal damage and 33% fewer public order offences but there was an increase in sexual offences and domestic assaults.
Home Affairs Minister Juan Watterson said: ""While recorded crime is falling, the demand on the constabulary is not.

"Leave Means Leave has written to the chambers of commerce in all the other 27 EU states, asking them to call for a ""sensible agreement regarding the terms of Britain's exit from the EU"".
The letter warns that trade barriers would have a ""detrimental effect"".
It also calls for uninterrupted trade as well as near-zero tariffs.
The letter was written by Leave Means Leave co-chairs Richard Tice and John Longworth, the former British Chambers of Commerce director-general. The group wants to ensure Brexit means the UK is no longer a member of the EU's single market.
They said there were ""many important elections taking place in EU member states"" next year.
""Businesses across Europe will want trade with the UK to continue as usual after Brexit and any hint of trade barriers by the European Commission will be rejected,"" they wrote.
""It is vital that these business leaders make representations to their national governments to ensure that the EU is open for business.""
Mr Longworth told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK would prosper outside the EU as it sought free trade agreements with partners around the world.
""This word 'access' I find curious - everybody has access to the EU single market; the US and China send billions of stuff to the EU every year,"" he added.
""It doesn't actually matter if we leave the single market and there are tariffs because they are on average 3.5% for manufactured goods, but it's better for everybody if there is a smooth trading relationship.""
Mr Longworth said he was yet to have many replies to the letter as it had been sent out over the festive period.
However, he said: ""I know that Danes, the Dutch, the Irish and some German companies are very concerned. I mean the German equivalent of the Confederation of British Industry said as much a few months ago.

"Raonic, 25, was beaten in Sunday's Wimbledon final by Andy Murray.
""I am making this decision for a variety of health concerns including the uncertainty around Zika,"" he said.
Losing Wimbledon quarter-finalist Halep, 24, said: ""I truly regret these circumstances.""
More than 20 male players have withdrawn from the golf competition at Rio 2016, with many concerned about the mosquito-borne virus.
Halep and Raonic are the first tennis players to make themselves unavailable because of Zika, which is linked to brain deformities in newborn babies.
""Family is much too important for me and I can't risk not being able to have one of my own after my career in tennis is over,"" said Halep.
Raonic, meanwhile, wrote on Facebook: ""I do not wish to impact the decision of any other athlete heading to the Games.

"In a result that could have been from the pages of a Roy of the Rovers comic, Merthyr Tydfil's part-timers defeated Serie A side Atalanta 2-1 in 1987.
While they lost the European Cup Winners Cup return leg, they had caught the attention of the world's media.
The players return to the club's Penydarren Park on Friday for the premiere of a film telling their story.
When ranking Welsh club football's greatest results, Cardiff City's 1971 victory against Real Madrid or Wrexham's 1984 triumph over Porto may be the more obvious choices for fans.
Even non-league Merthyr fan Matthew Davies, who made the film, admitted he had little knowledge of his team's moment of glory.
""Growing up (in the area), I didn't know much about it. It's only been in the last few years since I've started going down (to games) and finding out off fans,"" he said.
""There's not much footage online, but someone gave me archive footage and the whole story unravelled in front of me. It was quite incredible.""
Mr Davies has now watched the match over 100 times and describes it as ""a fantastic game"" with the 10,000 fans creating an ""absolutely unbelievable"" atmosphere.
He also describes it as ""ridiculous"" that a bunch of electricians, labourers and accountants could defeat one of Italy's top sides.
The film, called The Martyrs of 87, uses interviews with the people involved - including chairman John Reddy, manager Lyn Jones and players Ceri Williams and Dai Webley.
Mr Davies said: ""There were so many characters that were there - working class valleys boys.
""The international media went crazy and I think some fans in Italy still keep an eye on Merthyr Tydfil and Merthyr Tydfil fans still keep an eye on Atalanta.
""There is almost a subconscious partnership between the two now.""

The company plans a limited service to outlying suburbs if the strike goes ahead..
Unison members accepted the pay offer in July but Unite - whose members make up around 70% of the workforce - called on the company to rethink its ""rigid negotiating strategy"".

"Counselling for suicide concerns increased by 25.8% in one year, up from 244 in 2014-15 to 307 in 2015-16.
Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland said the figures were disappointing.
The Welsh Government said it had taken steps to help young people who were ""experiencing emotional difficulties"".
More than 11,300 children were referred for counselling in Wales between 2015-2016, according to the Welsh Government statistics.
Family issues, stress and self-worth were the top three reasons for 11 to 18-year-olds being referred to services run by local authorities.
Carmarthen-based youth project Dr M'z said the use of social media and online chat rooms may contribute to young people's worries.
Project manager Gayle Harris said: ""In the last couple of years there has been an increase in young people who have been suffering from low mood and unhappiness.""
She added: ""I think a lot of it has got to do with screen time and social media, we have had incidents with online bullying and young people getting involved in online chat rooms.""
Year 10 pupils needed the most support, with 2,326 students referred for counselling in 2015-2016.
Ms Holland said the stress and anxiety associated with GCSEs could be ""overwhelming"" for 14 to 15-year-olds.
NSPCC Cymru said low self-esteem, suicide and self-harm were increasingly common worries for young people.
A spokesman said: ""Swift counselling for those children that require it is essential for their health and wellbeing and it's important that worries and anxieties are addressed as soon as possible.""
Rhondda Cynon Taf had the highest number of children referred for counselling in Wales with 1,607 cases - more than double the average for Welsh local authorities.
Charity Eye to Eye, which provides counselling services for children living in Rhondda Cynon Taf, said long-running services in the area encourage them to seek help.
The charity's co-ordinator Alison Theaker said: ""We have a huge service and the reason the numbers are high is because we have a huge input in the community.""
The Welsh Government said the number of children getting counselling for suicide was ""relatively small"".
A spokesman said: ""Counselling can support children and young people if they feel worried, frightened or afraid. It is also a means of preventing mental health problems from developing or escalating.
""We have introduced legislation which requires local authorities to make reasonable provision of counselling services for children and young people aged between 11-18 in their area and pupils in year six of primary school.
""At the same time we provided Â£4.5m to local authority budgets for the continued support of this service.""

"Self-employed status leaves workers vulnerable to ""exploitation"", the Work and Pensions Committee concluded after an investigation into the issue.
Staff should be designated as workers, with full rights, by default, MPs said.
In response, Uber said the vast majority of its drivers were happy with their terms.
""Almost all taxi and private hire drivers in the UK have been self-employed for decades, and with Uber they have more control over what they do,"" a spokesperson said.
""The vast majority of drivers who use Uber tell us they want to remain their own boss, as that's the main reason why they signed up to us in the first place.""
Last year an employment tribunal ruled that Uber drivers were wrongly classified as self-employed - the company is appealing against the ruling.
What is the gig economy?
Gig economy chiefs defend business model
Government starts review of gig economy
Deliveroo was also among the companies that gave evidence to the Work and Pensions Committee as part of its inquiry in to the so-called gig economy.
Deliveroo said in a statement: ""We receive 10,000 rider applications every week because people are attracted to the flexible way of working that we offer.
""Before Deliveroo existed, many workers in the food delivery business were paid in cash, in the black economy. All of our riders are registered to work legally and pay their taxes in the UK.
""Deliveroo is proud to offer well paid, flexible work to over 15,000 riders. Our riders on average earn well above the National Living Wage.""
In the report by the Work and Pensions Committee, chairman Frank Field said companies were ""avoiding all their responsibilities""  in order to profit from ""bogus self-employed designation"".
""This inquiry has convinced me of the need to offer 'worker' status to the drivers who work with those companies as the default option.""
If firms want to class workers as self-employed, they should be made to justify that move, he said.
Those changes would protect staff from ""the appalling practices that have been reported to the committee in this inquiry"".
Mr Field singled out Uber and its policy of charging drivers the costs of organising cover if they were off sick.
In its defence, Uber says it contributes towards a scheme that drivers can join, which gives a range of benefits including illness and injury cover.
Mr Field also said that self-employment caused ""substantial"" tax losses for the government.
Last year the government asked Matthew Taylor, former head of the Labour Policy Unit, to review employment practices.
The review will look at security, pay and rights and it will also examine whether there are ways to increase opportunities for carers, people with disabilities and the elderly.
Speaking on the subject last year, Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""If we are to build a country that works for everyone - not just the privileged few - we need to be certain that employment regulation and practices are keeping pace with the changing world of work.""","Drivers and couriers for companies like Uber and Deliveroo need full worker rights and not ""bogus"" self-employment status, MPs have said.",39765768

"The ovens had been kept alight until the weekend to allow for negotiations with prospective buyers.
But official receiver Ken Beasley said there was no ""realistic prospect"" of a sale and he could no longer spend taxpayer money to keep the plant going.
Local MPs have said the loss of 2,200 jobs is devastating.
The works has been hands in the hands of receivers since the site's owner Sahaviriya Steel Industries UK (SSI) was wound up on 2 October.
The closure of the coke ovens and blast furnace means the end of steel production at the 98-year-old Redcar works.
Once the furnace and ovens are closed it would take months and millions of pounds to get them going again, as happened when SSI re-opened the works in 2012.
Mr Beasley, said: ""I cannot continue to draw on taxpayers' funds to keep the ovens operational when there is no realistic prospect that a buyer will be found.
""I am continuing my liquidation of the company, including talking with interested parties about purchasing the company's other assets.""
Anna Turley, Labour MP for Redcar, said she was angered by the decision to close the works.
She told BBC Tees: ""I can't believe all this has been allowed to go, all the history and heritage and potential for the site.
""I feel the government has thrown the towel in. I feel the official receiver was never interested in talking to anyone or listening to any deals, or any other options to keep it going.""
She said she would call for an inquiry: ""I cannot believe the government has allowed 170 years of steelmaking to fade away with no fight, no determination and no understanding of what this means to our area, to people's livelihoods and to the British economy.""
Tom Blenkinsop, Labour MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, said it was a dark day for the area and accused the government of ""abandoning Teesside"".
He said: ""This is devastating news for the 2,200 workers who have lost their jobs.""
Middlesbrough MP Andy Macdonald, also Labour, said the closure was ""industrial vandalism"".
Business Secretary Sajid Javid said the closure was ""disappointing"" but the government was unable to intervene in the liquidation process.
He said the government would provide up to Â£80m to ""support people who have lost their jobs as a result of SSI's liquidation, and mitigate the impacts on the local economy"".
Mr Javid also said the government would host a steel summit on 16 October to ""explore"" the challenges the UK steel industry is facing.
Business Minister Anna Soubry said: ""I had hoped that a commercial buyer for the coke ovens could be found, but unfortunately this has not happened.
""This news is very, very disappointing and my thoughts are with the workers and their families.""

"Since New Year, social media reports have surfaced of a low pitched hum, while others in the same area cannot hear it.
Bristol City Council tried to measure the noise in April 1980 after scores of complaints, but the hum continues.
""It was definitely humming away last night,"" Sheila Masey told the BBC.
Mrs Masey has lived in Staple Hill, north of Bristol, for 34 years.  For the last 20 she has heard a ""low rumbly hum"".
""It's not every night, but there are certain nights when you think: 'Crikey, here we go'.
""I wouldn't say it wakes me up but if I can't drop off to sleep and it happens to be there, then I'm always conscious of it.""

Jake, from Downend, wrote on BBC Points West's Facebook page: ""I hear it about 80% of nights ... It's changed pitch lately, it seems like an electrical buzz... It's the not knowing what it actually is that drives me mental.""
Complaints about low frequency noise date back to the 1970s but most people do not hear it and some are sceptical about whether it exists at all.
'Occasionally receive complaints'
It is one of many ""hums"" worldwide and there have been many theories about its cause. Last year the Bristol Post reported that French researchers believed it was caused by waves vibrating on the ocean floor.
A Bristol City Council spokesman said: ""We do occasionally receive complaints of hums from across the city.

"He will challenge President Goodluck Jonathan - a repeat of the 2011 poll.
The elections in February look to be the closest fought since the end of military rule in 1999.
The 71-year-old former general, a Muslim from the north, seized power in 1983 but was himself deposed in a coup less than two years later.
He was up against four other candidates in the vote at the All Progressives Congress (APC) party convention in Lagos.
In the previous election, Mr Jonathan defeated Mr Buhari, with almost 59% of the vote against 32%, sparking widespread unrest in northern areas which backed Mr Buhari.
More than 500 people were killed and thousands of people were forced from their homes.
The governing People's Democratic Party (PDP) has gone for continuity with President Goodluck Jonathan and the current Vice President, Namadi Sambo as his running mate.
The APC's chosen candidate, Muhammadu Buhari, says the last thing Nigeria needs right now is continuity and he is promising to tackle the country's insecurity, corruption and economic worries.
The former military ruler has been out of power for close to 30 years and although popular, especially in northern Nigeria, there is little evidence to prove he has what it takes to fix the country.
In Nigeria the running mate is an important part of the team and can help bring in the votes.
But given the country's regional tensions, the APC needs someone from the south with a track record.
The outgoing governor of Lagos State, Babatunde Fashola, has earned plenty of respect for his reforms in the commercial capital.
As he is a Muslim, like Buhari, this option may not be acceptable even though religion has never been an issue during his tenure in Lagos.
Mr Buhari won 3,430 votes while his closest rival, former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, fell far short, with only 954 votes out of 8,000.
Mr Abubakar congratulated his opponent on Twitter after the vote and said: ""The delegates have spoken, you fully deserve the victory.""
This will be the fourth time Mr Buhari contests a presidential election - he is yet to win.
The BBC's Will Ross in Lagos says that this election is likely to be a tight race, especially if the opposition manages to stay united behind one candidate.
Whoever wins the presidency will need to deal with a growing jihadist insurgency in the north and an economy under strain due to the falling oil price.
President Jonathan was the sole candidate at the ruling PDP's primaries, also on Thursday.
He told his party members that ""today we are stronger, bigger and more in tune with the yearnings of our people"".
Mr Jonathan has faced mounting criticism over his handling of the Boko Haram insurgency.
Supporters of Mr Buhari believe that as a former army general, he is better placed to combat the militants.

"Although he was never the actual president of Panama, he was the key figure from 1983 to 1989  - and a key US ally in Central America for four decades.
His connection with the United States dated back to the 1950s, when according to various accounts, he was recruited as a CIA informant while studying at a military academy in Peru.
Noriega, now 77, eventually became a prized American ""asset"" in a region that was becoming politically hostile to US interests in the wake of the Cuban Revolution.
He rose within the ranks of the Panamanian armed forces to become a key supporter of Gen Omar Torrijos, the military ruler who signed a treaty with the US to restore the Panama Canal zone to Panamanian sovereignty in 1977.
After Gen Torrijos's death in a mysterious plane crash in 1981, Noriega became the power behind the scenes as head of the security services.
The US relied on Panama as a regional listening post and Noriega obliged with unfaltering support for the Contras in Nicaragua, and in the fight against the FMLN guerrillas in El Salvador.
At the same time, he began to play an increasingly repressive role internally in Panama, especially after the assassination of Hugo Spadafora, a political opponent who was found beheaded in 1985.
Noriega allegedly played a role in the mid-1980s Iran-Contra affair, which involved the smuggling of weapons and drugs to aid US undercover efforts to support the anti-government forces opposing the Sandinistas in Nicaragua.
However, the US became increasingly suspicious of Noriega amid indications that he was selling his services to other intelligence bodies, not to mention drug-trafficking organisations.
These tensions became public in 1988 when Noriega was indicted in a US federal court on drug-trafficking charges.
He was also accused of rigging elections in 1989.
By mid-December that year, ties had deteriorated so far that President George H W Bush launched an invasion, ostensibly because a US marine had been killed in Panama City, although the operation had been months in the planning.
Noriega sought refuge in the Vatican's diplomatic mission in Panama City. The US tactic to flush him out was to play deafening pop and heavy metal music non-stop outside the building.
By 3 January 1990, it had worked and Noriega surrendered. He was flown to the US with prisoner of war status to face charges of drug-trafficking, money-laundering and racketeering.
His trial there was an international spectacle that revealed titillating details of his personal life.
At the time it was said he wore red underwear to ward off the ""evil eye"".
In 2007, he concluded his sentence after 17 years of confinement and public silence in a Miami federal jail.
But his legal troubles were far from over and he remained in custody.
In 1999, Noriega had been convicted in absentia in France of using $3m in proceeds from Colombia's Medellin drug cartel drug trade to buy property there.
In March 2010, the US Supreme Court agreed to a French request extradite him to Paris, where he faced a new trial for money-laundering.
Noriega, who denied the charges, was found guilty and sentenced to seven years.
His legal odyssey took another turn on 23 November when a French court approved a request from Panama to send him back home, where he was convicted in absentia of murder, corruption and embezzlement.
He refused the chance to appeal the decision and flew out of Paris on 11 December, escorted by a team of Panamanian officials and a doctor.","For many years, Panama's General Manuel Noriega was the embodiment of the terms  ""military strongman"" and ""de facto leader"".",15853540
"The incident was reported at the Bekaot checkpoint in the northern West Bank. The soldiers were not injured.
The two Palestinian men, aged 23 and 38, were reported to be from villages south of Jenin.
Tension between Palestinians and Israelis has risen in recent months with a series of violent incidents.
The Palestinian Wafa news agency named those killed as Ali Muhammad Aqqab Abu-Maryam and Said Judah Abu-al-Wafa and said they had been shot ""in cold blood"".
The Israel Defense Forces said the soldiers had ""thwarted the attack and shot the assailants"".
Relations between Israelis and Palestinians remain tense amid a wave of attacks on Israelis by Palestinians and some Israeli Arabs which have killed 22 Israelis since the beginning of October.
During that time 149 Palestinians - more than half said by Israel to be attackers - have been shot dead by security forces or their victims. Others have been killed in clashes with Israeli forces.
Overnight, Israeli forces demolished a home in the West Bank belonging to relatives of a Palestinian - Muhannad Halabi - shot dead in October after killing a rabbi in Jerusalem's Old City.
Israel says home demolitions, which have come under international criticism, are a way of discouraging Palestinian attacks.
On Friday, an Israeli Arab wanted for shooting dead three people in Tel Aviv on 1 January was killed by security forces in northern Israel.
Nashat Melhem was followed to a mosque in his home town of Arara and died in a gun battle, police said.
Police said Melhem, 29, was the gunman who killed two Israelis at a bar, then the Israeli Arab driver of a taxi who picked him up after the attack.
Melhem's father, Mohammed, had identified his son as the suspect and reported him to the police. Mohammed Melhem and several relatives have been arrested in connection with the case.

"Cash has been seized four times since the law came into effect in February.
The law provoked angry exchanges when it was being debated, with the government arguing it was only fair to make refugees contribute.
Critics say the new figures prove their claim that the law was just ""symbolic"".
Why are countries seizing refugees' valuables?
Europe's migrant crisis
Police confirmed the cash confiscation figure to the BBC, saying they were authorised to search new arrivals for assets and only took those over and above a 10,000-kroner limit.
The sum was seized from individuals or groups of asylum-seekers on four occasions between June and October. The single biggest amount was 79,600 kroner taken from five Iranians on 30 June.
The figures were applauded by the anti-immigration Danish People's Party, with deputy Martin Henriksen telling AFP news agency the law had been ""a success in the sense that it sent a signal that we have tightened [the rules] in Denmark"".
A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Immigration, Integration and Housing defended the law, saying: ""The basic principle behind the rules on seizure is that anyone who has sufficient means has to support himself or herself.""
But Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen, from the Red-Green Alliance (Enhedslisten), which opposed the law, said her party still viewed it as ""a symbolic move to scare people away.
""And the very low amount of money that the law has resulted in seems to confirm this,"" said a spokesperson.
Asylum applications have dropped dramatically in Denmark so far in 2016, compared to 2015. The government said 5,500 applications were received until 30 October, compared to 21,000 in 2015.
But the Danish Refugee Council told the BBC the figures reflected a decline across Europe. That was attributable, the council said, to the EU's March deal with Turkey to stem the flow of migrants, and the closure of the Balkan route - not to the Danish confiscation policy.
It criticised the confiscation law, but said the new legislation contained another, sometimes overlooked element of greater importance to most asylum-seekers: an extension of the period migrants have to wait before applying for relatives to join them, from one year to three.
This is ""against the right to family life as stated in the European Convention on Human Rights and... inhumane, because the amendments to the rules for family reunification will have huge consequences for refugees coming to Denmark,"" the council said.","A controversial Danish law allowing asylum-seekers' assets to be confiscated has reaped only 117,600 kroner (Â£14,000; $17,500) for the state, police figures show.",37871792

Jonathan Smith of STW said: ""There's learning opportunities for us here, we don't think we did well enough for our customers throughout all of this.

"Kim took a six-shot lead into the final round but a course record-equalling 64 from England's Jodi Ewart Shadoff took her to within two shots of the lead.
But Kim, 29, maintained her form to post a 71 and win by two shots.
Another Englishwoman, Georgia Hall, had to settle for a tie for third after a 70, alongside American Michelle Wie (66) and German Caroline Masson (67).
A superb run of scoring saw Ewart Shadoff follow a birdie on the second hole with five in a row from the sixth and another on the 13th.

"UK researchers measured the finger length of 110 people, including 47 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common form of the disease.
The study, in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, suggests a link between a longer fourth finger relative to the index finger and ALS.
Experts say finger length cannot help screen for ALS and more work is needed.
The ratio between the fingers has already been linked to many traits, including sporting prowess and aggression, and is believed to be set in the womb.
Experts believe a longer fourth finger relative to the index finger could be partly determined by how much exposure a baby has to the male hormone testosterone before birth.
Indeed, men often do have slightly longer ring fingers than index fingers, while women often do not.
And experts know that motor neurons need testosterone for survival and repair, and men who are born without the ability to use testosterone in the normal way develop a form of motor neuron degeneration.
Dr Brian Dickie of the Motor Neurone Disease Association, said: ""This simple, but carefully conducted study raises some interesting questions about how events occurring before birth may increase the risk of developing motor neuron disease later in life.
""But it's important to remember that exposure to higher testosterone in the womb does not directly cause motor neuron disease.
""Many people with long ring fingers will never develop motor neuron disease as we believe there are numerous genetic and environmental factors that need to coincide in order to trigger the disease.""","The length of a person's fingers could reveal their risk of motor neurone disease, according to a study.",13332415

Bobsleigh was first created in the late 19th Century when Swiss pioneers paired together two skeleton boards, along with a steering mechanism, to create a toboggan for use in the resort town of St Moritz.
This form of toboggan allowed for multiple passengers - and later team members as bobsleigh became a highly competitive international sport, harnessing the latest in aerodynamics technology.
Bobsleigh, like sister-sport skeleton, relies on the start for much of what follows. You need to push the sled down the track before jumping in - logic dictates that the faster you push it, the quicker you'll go once you're on-board.
That means the push-start is vital and bobsleigh athletes train hard to be exceptionally strong and quick. Current GB bobsleigh athletes have set faster 100m times than many dedicated 100m runners, for example. So if you sign up for bobsleigh, you can expect an intense workout alongside sitting in a technologically advanced barrel while plummeting down an ice slope.
British Bobsleigh is the governing body in charge of the sport and provides access to facilities and training, centred around the GB team's complex at the University Of Bath.
British Bobsleigh offers a membership package which gives members the chance to compete at the British Championships, alongside a Try it! page with more details.
Tourists in continental Europe, many of them British, first made the sport of toboggan - and later bobsleigh - both practical and popular. The first bobsleigh club was opened in the resort town of St Moritz in 1897.
According to the International Olympic Committee, the name 'bobsleigh' comes from the effect of the sleigh on competitors as they bobbed along the track.
The importance of a decent start in any bobsleigh race was soon recognised and, as competitions became more organised and professional, a weight limit was placed on a whole team in an effort to help teams get a good start without gifting any other team an unfair advantage.
In 1924, bobsleigh became one of the first sports at the inaugural Winter Olympic Games, where a four-man race took place, Switzerland took gold with Great Britain finishing as runners-up. The women's event was introduced for the 2002 Salt Lake City Games.

"The 48-year-old has joined the Trotters from fellow League One side Bradford City after the two clubs agreed a compensation deal.
Parkinson will be joined at Bolton, who finished bottom of the Championship last season, by assistant Steve Parkin.
Nigel Adkins and Steve Cotterill had also been in the running to take charge at the Macron Stadium.
Bolton had been without a permanent manager since Neil Lennon left by mutual consent in March, with academy boss Jimmy Phillips taking charge for the end-of-season run-in.
Former Hull, Colchester and Charlton boss Parkinson is best known for leading Bradford to a series of cup upsets.
In the 2012-13 season, he led the Bantams to the final of the League Cup, having beaten Premier League giants Arsenal on penalties in the quarter-finals before knocking out Aston Villa over two legs in the last four.

But City could not cause the ultimate upset, as the then-League Two side were humbled 5-0 by Swansea City in the final.
In January 2015, Bradford again made headlines under Parkinson as they came back from 2-0 down to beat Chelsea 4-2 in the FA Cup fourth round - the only time any side came back from a two-goal deficit to win at Stamford Bridge while Jose Mourinho was in charge.
City went on to beat Sunderland in the next round before losing 3-0 to Championship side Reading in a quarter-final replay.
The Bantams were recently bought by a German consortium, but Parkinson said the club's change of ownership was not a factor in his decision to take the Bolton job.
""It was a very tough call to leave, and I just felt that I wanted a fresh challenge,"" he told BBC Radio Manchester.
""I'd like to thank the new owners, who've been very reasonable and fair about this and they haven't for one minute pushed me out of the door. I wish them all the best for the future and I think they'll be very successful.
""I just fancied a new challenge and got this great opportunity, and it was too good to turn down.""
Bradford have also released a statement on the club's website, describing Parkinson's departure as being on ""mutually good terms"".
Bolton's relegation from the Championship means they will be playing in the third tier of English football for the first time since 1992-93.

Iran has carried out several since a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.
A 2010 Security Council resolution, which barred Iran from undertaking any work on ""ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads"", was terminated after the nuclear deal was implemented a year ago.
It was replaced by a new resolution, 2231, which ""calls upon"" Iran not to ""undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology"".
Iran says its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and that it will continue missile development.

Iran nuclear deal: Key details
Mr Dehghan did not say what type of missile was tested, but he stressed it was not a breach of the nuclear deal nor resolution 2231.
Iran only produced weapons to defend its ""goals and national interests"", he added.
His comments came after the UN Security Council held a special session to discuss the issue.
US permanent representative Nikki Haley said Iran was believed to have tested a ballistic missile capable of carrying a 500kg (1,100lb) payload and with a range of more than 300km (187 miles). ""That is more than enough to be able to deliver a nuclear weapon,"" she added.
Ms Haley said that was something the world ""should be alarmed about"".
""The United States is not naive,"" she added. ""We are not going to stand by. You will see us call them out as we said we would and you are also going to see us act accordingly.""
The Security Council's member states requested a report on the test from UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and a UN committee.

Harris took advantage of Micky Young holding off Dickson to score Falcons' second try, while Goode and Myler both scored two penalties in the first half.
After veteran Goode furthered his side's advantage, Northampton responded through Dickson, who spotted a gap to touch down, before finding himself under a pile of bodies to score his second try, and JJ Hanrahan's conversion brought them to within one point with 13 minutes to go.

"Nations have jointly promised to keep the global temperature rise below the 2C danger threshold.
They are informing the UN how they will each cut their domestic emissions of greenhouse gases.
But key countries are refusing to discuss whether the sum of these cuts will do the job.
The EU, supported by African nations, wants to make countries face up to the fact that their collective cuts won't keep the climate within the 2C threshold.
But China, India and Brazil are insisting that the national contributions should not be discussed at the UN until the main summit in Paris in December, by which time it will be too late for countries to negotiate any increase in ambition.
The Chinese chief negotiator, Su Wei, said talks about the procedure for a new UN climate regime were going so slowly there was no time to discuss whether the emissions cuts added up.
""It has taken us 10 days here discussing procedural matters and we have made hardly any progress,"" he told the BBC. ""We cannot add any more items to the agenda to be discussed before Paris.""
Other nations blame China for orchestrating moves to slow progress in Bonn. Tasneep Essop from the World Wildlife Fund said the situation was ""bizarre"".
""The aim of this process is to stabilise the climate, yet delegates are being prevented from even talking about it,"" he told the BBC.
""We want a full science-based review of all the countries' intended contributions so the world's public can see whether politicians are keeping their promises. It is clear already that countries need to do more.""
China is expected to make its own climate offer to the UN in the next few weeks, and experts expect it to over-achieve on its promises. But as China is winning praise for its domestic actions it is accused of attempting to weaken international scrutiny.
The tasks of planning domestic energy policies and negotiating a new international treaty are in the hands of completely different sets of bureaucrats.
Michael Jacobs from the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate said the stand-off proves that countries' individual climate targets should be left flexible when they are presented at the Paris meeting.
""It's clear the contributions should remain open to be raised between now and 2020. We can't afford for them to be locked in because we have to find new ways of raising ambition.""
Mr Jacobs, former climate advisor to Gordon Brown, said international co-operation over city planning, standards for buildings and machines, and aviation and shipping could help achieve deeper emissions cuts than already envisaged.

Since its launch in 2010, Instagram has gained more than 100 million registered users, becoming one of the most popular social media services.
Facebook bought the app using its own shares. They were worth about $1bn (Â£625m) at the time, although they have since fallen in value.
The company has been keen to stress that users can restrict who has access to their uploads.
But Nick Pickles, from Big Brother Watch, expressed concern that the facility would make it easier for users to copy and spread potentially embarrassing photos allowing them to go viral.
""A web-based service makes it easier to collect lots of information about people using the service and also makes it easier for people to share photos their friends post,"" he said.
""Clearly both of these issues raise privacy questions, and time will tell if the company really has any desire to address them.""","Instagram, a photo-sharing app recently purchased by social network Facebook, has extended from mobile devices to the web.",20222086

"Kirov region governor Nikita Belykh was held in a Moscow restaurant.
Investigators posted a picture which purports to show the governor of the central region at a table with cash from a bribe.
Mr Belykh has been a Kremlin critic, but the investigators say there is no political subtext to the case.
On Friday, the Russian investigative committee (SKR) published a photograph on its website, saying it showed Mr Belykh and piles of 100-euro notes laid out before him.
They say he is suspected of accepting the money, personally and through an intermediary, in return for protecting dodgy investment business in the region.
Mr Belykh, who once led the opposition Union of Right Forces, has made no public comment on the issue.
SKR spokesman Vladimir Markin pointed out that - ""anticipating hysteria"" from Mr Belykh's supporters - there was no political background to his arrest.

"On the one hand, the nameless official spokesperson makes the perhaps surprising claim that ""public sector net borrowing still remains in line with the Budget forecast"".
But just in case that turns out to be the triumph of pre-election hope over painful fiscal reality, the statement also adds that ""we have to recognise that the UK is not immune to the problems being experienced in Europe and other parts of the world economy"".
Which is as if to say: if the chancellor fails to reduce the deficit as promised this year, blame those flatlining Europeans please - not a Treasury failure to gauge the tax-paying capacity of the economy.
So what do the figures show?
Well last month public sector net borrowing actually fell (makes a nice change, you might say) compared with the same period last year, by £200m to £7.7bn.
But the Treasury would normally caution against looking at one month's figures. So what is the seven-month picture, compared with last year's?
Well as of the end of October 2014, net borrowing is £64.1bn, which compares with £60.5bn the government had borrowed by the same date in 2013.
So as of now, government net borrowing is 6.1% higher than last year, compared with the budget forecast - made by the Office for Budget Responsibility - that net borrowing would fall by 11.2% in the whole year.
To put it another way, if the government is to hit the target of borrowing £86.6bn in the full year, it must borrow no more than £22.5bn in the remaining five months.
In other words, it has to borrow at an average monthly rate of just £4.5bn from now till April, compared with the £9.1bn it has been borrowing on average so far this year.
Which is why some may be surprised by the Treasury's statement that borrowing is in line with the budget forecast.
So is it plausible that the borrowing rate will more than halve between now and the end of the year?
Well it is conceivable, I suppose, that the Autumn Statement in 10 days will announce a massive unprecedented short-term squeeze on departmental spending.
And, of course, a good deal of tax revenue is always back-ended - or paid late in the fiscal year.
In 2013-14 for example, there was £37bn of borrowing in the last five months of the year, compared with £60.5bn in the first seven months.
Even so, if that same monthly distribution of borrowing was replicated this year, with a big fall in borrowing in the coming months, the outcome for the year as a whole would still be a deficit of £103bn, which would be 5.6% higher than last year and 19% above the budget forecast.
Could a borrowing overshoot of that magnitude really be blamed on a stagnating eurozone?
Hmmm.
What has gone wrong?
Well the big story is that income tax revenues have not recovered as the economy has recovered.
Income tax receipts actually fell 0.4% to £81.5bn in the first seven months of the year.
Part of that fall is a direct result of government policy - in the sense that the increase in the tax-free personal allowance to £10,000 means many more people on low wages are not paying any tax at all.
Also, although the housing market boom has led to a 21.4% rise in stamp duty payments, the Treasury was actually expecting more from stamp duty.
There was however just a hint of a thaw in the long cold fiscal winter with a 4.2% rise in corporate tax receipts.
But, in spite of austerity, public spending was 2.3% up - due to a 2.7% rise in social benefits, supposedly mostly pension increases, and a 12.4% jump in capital spending.
Now it is possible that the widening deficit will suddenly narrow again in the coming weeks and months.
But a significant overshoot is more likely.
And that would be an explosive new element for the imminent general-election battle, because it implies any new government would have to immediately raise taxes or slash spending even more than current plans.",The Treasury's statement on this morning's government borrowing figures for October - which are a bit less dire than those in the first six months of the year - is a classic of its kind.,30144813

"In 2015, a tentative deal to pay $2.6bn was announced, but New York authorities pushed to increase that amount.
Morgan Stanley acknowledged it had misrepresented the quality of the mortgage bonds.
The bank said it had previously set aside funds for the settlement.
""Today's settlement will deliver resources to the families and communities that need them the most, while helping New Yorkers avoid foreclosure, and spurring the construction of more affordable housing units statewide,"" said Eric Schneiderman, New York's attorney general.
The settlement will be spread across state and federal authorities in the form of fines and consumer relief.
New York's Attorney General said $550m of the deal will be allocated to New York.
Morgan Stanley's settlement is far less than peers like Bank of America, which paid $16.65bn.
This is in part because Morgan Stanley did not issue the original mortgages itself, but instead purchased home loans from other banks and packaged them together to sell as bonds to investors.
Morgan Stanley admitted knowing the mortgages were risky, but was cleared of some culpability because it did not issue mortgages to home buyers it suspected would not be able to pay them.

"Estate owner Nick Oppenheim told BBC Scotland that a planned extension to a wind farm would secure 150 jobs.
RSPB Scotland has voiced ""serious alarm"" at moves to expand a proposed 39-turbine development on the island's Eisgein Estate by 30 turbines.
The area has one of the highest densities of  
          golden eagles
 in Europe.
International Power GDF Suez acquired the rights to the 39-turbine project from Mr Oppenheim in April.
Mr Oppenheim's company, Uisinis Power has now sought permission from Scottish ministers to start the moves towards an expansion.
International Power GDF Suez could potentially acquire the rights to the extension if approved.
'Without people'
Mr Oppenheim said the projects would help to slow depopulation of the island.
He said: ""The extension will provide continuity for the 150 men taken on to build the first wind farm.
""Without that continuity they will lose their jobs.
""On Lewis the population has been in decline for many years. The population of eagles - both white-tailed and golden - has been in the ascendance now for many years.""
Mr Oppenheim added: ""If RSPB have their way and this trend is encouraged, Lewis will become a bird sanctuary without people.""
RSPB Scotland said it was not opposed to wind power developments as a way of reducing carbon emissions and where it believed turbines do not pose serious threats to wildlife, or habitats.
However, it has strongly opposed the 39-turbine Eisgein project and the planned extension.

The Plastics Economy Innovation Prize, promoted by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, is split into two sections.
One seeks ideas to prevent the sea being strewn with small plastic items like coffee cup lids, plastic straws and plastic bottle tops. The other seeks innovations in general product design and materials so items are easier to recycle.
One of the competition organisers, Chris Grantham from the London branch of the global design consultancy Ideo, agreed that Pringles and Lucozade Sport – and brands with similar packaging – were singled out by the industry as almost impossible to recycle.
He listed examples of easily-recyclable products:
In future, Mr Grantham said, designers would need to produce items that could be used again and again as pressure on materials increases from a growing population.
More new thinking is emerging with the growth in online grocery shopping - if the customer has already bought a product like a ready meal online, he says, that product doesn’t need branding.
The technology exists, Mr Grantham says, for a fridge to be fitted with a mini-projector to project branding on a blank container.
One task, he says, is to persuade supermarkets not to copy problematic complex designs.

The Wales forward came off the bench after 77 minutes in Saturday's 4-1 win over Juventus in Cardiff as Real Madrid secured a third title in four seasons.
The 27-year-old, who signed a deal until 2022 in October, has been linked with a move away from the Bernabeu.
""We are winning trophies and I am happy. I have signed a long-term contract at Madrid,"" said Bale.
""My family is happy and I am happy, so yes we will continue what we are doing.""
The former Tottenham player joined Real in 2013 for a then world record fee of £85m.
""It's the reason why I came to Real Madrid - to win trophies. We're enjoying winning them at the moment, so we'll continue to do so,"" Bale added.
""Three Champions Leagues in four seasons isn't too bad.
""I think we can get better. We are still quite young as a whole team and we have a great squad.""
Bale was determined to play in the final in his home city despite still being troubled by an ankle injury.
He had surgery in November and suggested that without the Cardiff final in his sights he may have opted for a second operation.
""It's been difficult with my ankle this year,"" Bale said.
""I obviously came back way too early from my surgery and I suffered a bit.
""We were considering more at one point, but I've worked tirelessly hard to get back and to get ready for this game.
""I need to go on holiday and rest, and come back stronger next season - mainly for my ankle just to get it properly recovered.
""Then I'll obviously do some work in the off-season to get it stronger and ready for next season so I'll be firing on all cylinders.""
Bale replaced Karim Benzema with Real leading 3-1 thanks to two Ronaldo goals and a long-range strike from Casemiro.
""I was just happy to get on for the last few minutes,"" Bale said.
""We just had to go for it. It's always cagey in a final but we're happy with the win.
""To play a final in your home city is incredible, but to win it is even better, a great experience.
""Cardiff has held an incredible event and we've literally not had a problem since we've been here; it's been immaculate.
""I don't think many players have won the Champions League in their home city where they were born, so it's a great memory to have.""
Bale became the sixth player to lift the Champions League or European Cup in their home town, and the first since Nicolas Anelka with Real in 2000 in Paris.
The others are Angelo di Livio (Rome 1996), Alex Stepney (London 1968), and Miguel Munoz and Enrique Mateos (both Madrid 1957).
Bale also became the first Welshman to win the trophy three times - he also won it with Real last season and in 2014 - edging ahead of Ian Rush, Ryan Giggs and Joey Jones.
Bale is suspended for Wales' World Cup qualifier in Serbia on 11 June and will rest over the summer in a bid to regain full fitness, having also suffered calf problems along with his ankle injury.

"A raft of NHS England targets missed again, including waiting times for operations and the A&E four-hour benchmark, led one senior health official to argue that the system was ""unsustainable"" without enough resources to deliver what the public expected.
New analysis shows that health spending in the UK expressed as a share of national income (GDP) is just above the average for the European Union.
So does that mean the UK is spending enough on the NHS? Or is there still a need for higher funding?
Comparisons between UK healthcare spending and other leading economies in the past have been difficult because of varying definitions.
Some countries include elements of what could be considered social care in their published health data. But these differences have been ironed out by the international economic organisation, the OECD.
Using the data compiled by the OECD, the Nuffield Trust think-tank has compiled a European league table for health spending.
It shows that the UK spent 9.8% of GDP on healthcare (including both the NHS and private health) in 2014. This was slightly above the average of 9.7% for the EU 15 (the member states before the new joiners in 2004).
On the face of it, this paints a rosier picture of UK health spending. Previous estimates suggested it was below the European average and that this was one of the main causes of the problems facing the NHS.
The league table has the UK in the middle of the European pack, ahead of countries like Finland, Spain and Italy.
But being mid-table by definition means not being one of the leaders of the pack. The UK figure is below that of three comparable economies - France, Sweden and Germany - which each spend 11.1% of national income on health.
If their political and administrative leaders have all settled on the same level of spending, it is tempting to think there is a case to be made for that share of the cake to be allocated to the nation's health.
The difference between 9.8% and 11.1% may not sound a lot, but in cash terms it amounts to a tidy sum.  Should the UK, through its four governments, decide to move up to that higher figure, it would add about £24bn a year to health spending.
That would mean at least a 4p in the pound increase in income tax, or significant alternative tax-raising or cost-saving measures in other departments.
Spending per head of population is another useful gauge.
On this basis, Germany and Switzerland are ahead of France with each spending the equivalent of about £3,700 per person, compared with an approximate £2,850 in the UK.
None of this proves that money is the answer. The case for greater efficiency in the NHS has been consistently made, with its advocates arguing that savings can be made in some areas and reallocated to front line care.
Other leading economies in Europe have insurance-based health systems with a different culture to the NHS. Arguably they are less efficient than the NHS, which topped a recent international health league table compiled by the Commonwealth Fund think-tank.
The authors of the analysis, written as an article for the British Medical Journal, were John Appleby of Nuffield Trust and Ben Gershlick of the Health Foundation. They argue that deciding what to invest is a complex process:  ""How much we spend on health is a political choice - informed by the preferences of the population and what we can achieve with different levels of spending, determined by the efficiency of the system.""
Demands for money for the NHS will continue as winter approaches and the state of the health service rises up the political agenda. Thanks to the OECD and Nuffield, there is now some data to inform that debate.",The total waiting list for routine surgery in England rising above four million patients for the first time in a decade has focused minds again on whether more money should be invested in the NHS.,40903924

"A huge rise in false claims has left travel bosses ""embarrassed"" by a trend which they say is a ""British problem"".
Abta chief executive Mark Tanzer said the fraud is ""one of the biggest issues that has hit the travel industry for many years"".
He added that tourists chasing false or exaggerated claims ""risk ending up in jail either in the UK or abroad"".
Tens of thousands of UK tourists have put in for compensation in the past year, even though sickness levels in resorts have remained stable.
Abta says the cases usually involve holidaymakers who have been abroad on all-inclusive deals, who argue that because they only ate in their hotel, that must have been the source of their alleged food poisoning.
It has launched a campaign called Stop Sickness Scams, asking the government to clamp down on the issue.
It says laws designed to stop fraudulent claims for whiplash have instead pushed the problem of false insurance submissions on to overseas holidays instead.
This is because of a cap on the legal fees that can be charged by law firms pursuing personal injury cases at home.
Mr Tanzer added: ""The government must urgently address this issue. The legal loophole that is allowing firms to unduly profit from these claims must be closed.
""This would allow people with genuine claims access to justice but make this area less attractive to claims firms.""
Travel firm Tui said it had experienced a 15-fold rise in holiday sickness claims in the past year, costing between £3,000 and £5,000 a time, which was often more than the value of the holiday itself.
Tui's UK managing director Nick Longman and Thomas Cook UK's managing director Chris Mottershead both warned that if the problem continued, it could spell the end of the all-inclusive holiday for UK travellers.
Mr Mottershead said: ""It has the potential of putting hoteliers out of business. They will stop British customers coming into their hotels.""
Joel Brandon-Bravo, managing director of Travelzoo UK, told BBC Radio 5 live's Wake Up To Money that the upward trend was being driven by claims management companies.
""People are being called when they get back from holiday and encouraged to make claims and we've also seen evidence of them employing touts outside resorts encouraging people to make a claim and walking them through the process to make it easy for them,"" he said.
Mr Brandon-Bravo added that he felt people who were trying to cheat the system were not aware of the consequences if they were caught.
""Generally it is not made clear that if a claim is found to be fraudulent the individual could have a criminal record.
""In fact, there is one case going through right now with a Greek hotel, who is counter-suing a couple who made a claim for sickness three years ago for £10,000 and the hotel is counter-suing them for £170,000.
""They tried to withdraw their claim but they are seriously worried they could lose their house.""
Package holiday operator Jet2 has decided to hire private detectives to tackle the issue.
It says it is using the private eyes for ""one purpose and one purpose only - to prevent this dishonest behaviour from ruining the holidays of our customers"".
It added: ""The net really is tightening on this dishonest and deceitful practice, and we will not relent until these touts stop trying to take advantage of British holidaymakers.""
The Foreign Office has also advised tourists against making any fraudulent claims.
""If you make a false or fraudulent claim, you may face legal proceedings in the UK or Spain,"" the FCO warns.
""There have been reports of an increase in holidaymakers being encouraged to submit a claim for personal injury if they have experienced gastric illness during their stay,"" says the FCO website.
""You should only consider pursuing a complaint or claim if you have genuinely suffered from injury or illness.""

"HM Coastguard said two of the whales were found on a beach near Skegness at about 20:30 GMT on Saturday, while a third was discovered on Sunday morning.
The Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme will examine the bodies.
The pod was spotted off the Norfolk coast on Friday before the Hunstanton whale became stranded and died.
James Gilbert, from East Lindsey District Council, said the death of the whales was ""unbelievably sad"".
He added: ""We had heard about the whale that came ashore in Norfolk, so we had an early insight that there may be potential for some to arrive on our coast as well.
""All three are massive, beautiful animals, and it's just such a shame to see them on the beach in that way.""
One of the whales is at the end of Lagoon Walk, with the other two towards Gibraltar Point.
They were cordoned off to prevent people from touching the carcasses.
What happens after a whale is beached?
Mr Gilbert said the council needs to contact the relevant authorities to see if they want to examine the carcasses before they are removed.
""I know from previous occurrences they have wanted to do so, which does delay the process for us slightly in removing them from the beach, but our teams are geared up ready to do that as soon as they are given permission,"" he said.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the Skegness whales are believed to be from the same pod as the Hunstanton whale, but the whereabouts of the rest of the pod is unknown at this stage.
UK Coastguard Richard Johnson said: ""We believe the three whales at Skegness died at sea and then washed ashore.
""We are advising members of the public to stay away from the beach.""

The inquiry is to establish the procedures relevant to the receipt, distribution and sale of tickets allocated by the International Olympic Committee to national Olympic committees as well as accreditations given by national Olympic committees.
It will also examine the government funding of the OCI and its corporate governance.
The OCI said it welcomed the appointment of the retired judge and said that it intends to co-operate fully with the inquiry.
The Irish Minister for Agriculture, Michael Creed, said that if there was a situation where anyone was dragging their feet and not co-operating, the government could establish a statutory inquiry.
This would mean that witnesses could be compelled to give evidence.
Mr Creed said the facts must be established because the controversy had taken from the achievements of Irish athletes and had tarnished the country's reputation.

"British Muslims have told the BBC they are worried about people who made the pilgrimage and have not been heard from since Thursday's incident, in which 717 people died.
The Foreign Office said it was seeking information from Saudi authorities on any Britons who might be affected.
Anyone worried about friends or family can call a helpline on 020 7008 1500.
So far no British nationals have been confirmed among the dead following the incident, which happened at Mina as two million pilgrims took part in the last major rite of the Hajj pilgrimage.
Saleem Kidwai, of the Muslim Council of Wales, has said he is aware of one group of pilgrims from Cardiff which has not so far made contact with home.
On Thursday Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said UK officials were ""checking hospitals and other locations to urgently gather information about British nationals who may require assistance"".
Speaking to the BBC in East London earlier, one British woman, Amy, said most British Muslims would know someone attending the pilgrimage.
""Currently I have about, maybe, 10 friends over there, some of whom we're still trying to get hold of,"" she said.
She added that most people making the trip did not take their phones, as it was a ""spiritual journey"" - but as Saudi authorities were releasing details of the dead she assumed that ""no news is good news"".
British pilgrim Kashif Latif told the BBC he passed through the area ""a couple of hours"" before the tragedy happened.
He said he first heard something was wrong when loved ones in the UK phoned to make sure he was not hurt.
But he added: ""We had seen a lot of skirmishes and a lot of close calls purely through the sheer volume of people that there are at the Hajj.""
Rashid Mogradia, chief executive of the Council of British Hajjis (CBH), told the BBC the place where British pilgrims camp was ""kilometres away from the main incident point"".
""We have to take some kind of consolation to know that they are away from the actual incident place,"" he added.
The CBH estimates that more than 25,000 UK Muslims travel each year to take part in the Hajj, a five-day pilgrimage that every adult Muslim must perform at least once in their lives if they can afford it and are physically able.","UK families are awaiting news of relatives in Saudi Arabia, following the fatal stampede near Mecca.",34356056

"Mr Yang, who is also known by his pen-name Guo Feixiang, is accused of disturbing public order last year.
He has claimed that the trial, being conducted in the southern city of Guangzhou, is illegal and improper.
Chinese authorities have mounted a widespread crackdown on dissenters and critics in recent years.
Mr Yang, 48, and another activist Sun Desheng, 32, had organised a small protest calling for media freedom outside the offices of major newspaper Southern Weekend. Its journalists had complained about government censorship.
Mr Yang released a statement from prison on the eve of the trial saying there had been numerous violations of legal procedure.
He claimed his lawyers had not been allowed copies of evidence against him and he was unable to mount a proper defence.
""I express my strongest protest and condemnation of... this flagrant violation of the rule of law,"" he said in a statement posted on the website of activist network New Citizens' Movement, which he is a member of.
One of Mr Yang's lawyers told Reuters that the four lawyers representing both Mr Yang and Mr Sun were boycotting the trial because they were not granted at least three days advance notice to prepare.
Mr Yang is known for helping residents of a southern Chinese village organise themselves in 2006 against a local Communist Party official who they accused of illegally selling their land to enrich themselves, according to AFP.
He was later sentenced to five years in prison for ""running an illegal business"".
The BBC's Damian Grammaticas says Mr Yang's prosecution is being watched closely as it comes amid the broadest crackdown carried out by China's ruling Communist Party in recent years.

"Suresh Patel said Northampton South MP David Mackintosh was correct to step aside ""as there is a major police investigation going on"".
The Conservative MP had been criticised over his role in the council's loan to Northampton Town when he was leader.
He has denied any wrongdoing but faced de-selection by the party.
Mr Patel, who sits on the executive committee of Northampton South Conservative Association, said it was ""likely"" Mr Mackintosh would have been de-selected at a local party meeting where his candidacy was expected to be opposed.
Mr Mackintosh was criticised over the loan to the football club from Northampton Borough Council - when he was leader - to rebuild Sixfields stadium and develop nearby land.
Political opponents of Tory Mr Mackintosh have been lining up to have their say after he decided not to defend his Northampton South seat.
Here's how the other parties have reacted to the news.
Rose Gibbins, chairwoman, UKIP Northampton: ""The branch feels like this should help UKIP to increase its vote in Northampton South but we haven't selected a candidate yet.""
Jill Hope, Liberal Democrat candidate, Northampton South: ""I was genuinely disappointed because I was looking forward to public meetings where he could be challenged on the £10.25m that was given to the Cobblers.""
Kevin McKeever, Labour candidate, Northampton South: ""Let's not pretend he did it of his own accord. He jumped before he was pushed and it's a shame the electorate can't give their verdict on his performance.""
Steve Miller, coordinator and secretary, Northamptonshire Green Party: ""The Conservative Party probably knew it would have been very difficult to defend the seat had David Mackintosh been the candidate.""
Millions of pounds of public money was lost and the loan is subject to a police investigation into ""alleged financial irregularities"".
Mary Markham, who succeeded Mr Mackintosh as borough council leader, thanked him for ""being brave enough to make this decision"".
She said she could not support Mr Mackintosh because ""that's the message I've been getting from the electorate"".
She added three-quarters of the Conservative Party's executive committee would not have supported Mr Mackintosh's selection.
""But it's a very sad day it had to come to this in the first place,"" she added.
Brian Binley, who represented Northampton South between 2005 and 2015, said he would be prepared to stand in the seat.
""If the party thinks I can help them win this seat to give Theresa May as strong a base as possible for the Brexit negotiations, I will,"" he said.
He added: ""I always thought it was right and proper David should clear his name first.""
A candidate will be chosen from a list of three provided by Conservative Party central office.
A BBC investigation found Mr Mackintosh benefited from £30,000 in ""hidden"" donations to his 2015 general election fighting fund from individuals with links to the company into which most of the loan money disappeared.
Mr Mackintosh previously told the BBC he welcomes the investigation and ""will co-operate fully with police"".

"This dense region of gas and dust some 6,500 light-years from Earth hosts copious numbers of bright new stars.
Radiation from these objects is sculpting the clouds of gas and dust, producing in places great columns and curtains of material.
The picture is being featured on the BBC's Stargazing Live series.
Brian Cox and Dara O'Briain are presenting the popular programmes this week from Jodrell Bank radio observatory in Cheshire.
Look just below the centre of the image and you will see the columns that were famously dubbed the ""Pillars of Creation"" when they were pictured by the Hubble telescope in 1995.
But Herschel and Hubble see distinctly different things in the nebula.
Hubble is sensitive to optical light, the kind of light we detect with our eyes. This is easily blocked or scattered by the dust, and shows us merely the shape of the billowing clouds of material.
Herschel, on the other hand, is sensitive to much longer wavelength radiation, in far-infrared. This enables it to detect the emission coming directly from the cold gas and dust that cloaks so much of the region.
It is a powerful ability that enables Herschel to look inside the columns and curtains, at the places where dense gas is collapsing under its own weight to trigger the nuclear reactions that give rise to new stars.
Herschel's is a false colour image in which the bluer material is relatively warm and the redder material is relatively cold. It is ""relative"" because these are temperatures below minus 200C.
""The Eagle Nebula is one of the iconic regions of space popularised by Hubble but this has been our first chance to look at it with Herschel,"" explained Professor Glenn White from the Open University.
""The dusty material you see in Herschel's image is the material that will form the next generation of stars.
""Where you see little points, what you're looking at are the cocoons, the envelopes, inside which young stars are forming. Those stars will eventually blow away all the material that surrounds them and their optical light will become visible to us,"" he told BBC News.
Also released by the European Space Agency (Esa) is an image at X-ray wavelengths of the central portion of the nebula.
This picture, acquired by Esa's XMM-Newton space telescope, picks out the cluster of hot young stars that are doing so much to shape the whole region.
The intense radiation from this cluster, known as NGC6611, is working to erode the famous pillars.
Scientists are using the XMM data to try to hunt down the remains of a giant star thought to have exploded thousands of years ago.
If we could magically and instantly transport ourselves to the Eagle Nebula, we might even see that the shockwave from this supernova has toppled the famous pillars completely.
However, because of the great distance to the region and the time it takes even light to travel across the vast expanse of space, the pillars' fate is something we will not know until long into the future.

"The Countryfile presenter said it was ""disappointing"" to see the pay disparity when the corporation revealed its highest paid stars last month.
Rani told the Press Association: ""It's difficult for everybody but, for me, as much as it's about gender I think it's about race and it's about class.""
The presenter added ""there is a lot to be sorted out"".
""I think this is the beginning of a big shift and a change, which is a good thing,"" she said.
Asked if the revelations were as she expected, she said: ""Knowing something intellectually and seeing it on paper are always two very different things, it was disappointing.""
The BBC published a list of stars who are paid more than Â£150,000 in July, as part of its annual report.
Two thirds of the stars were male, with the highest paid names including Chris Evans, Gary Lineker, Jeremy Vine and Graham Norton. Claudia Winkleman was the highest paid female star.
The highest-paid stars from an ethnic minority background were George Alagiah, Jason Mohammed and Trevor Nelson - with Mishal Husain the top-earning female.
Matt Baker was the only Countryfile presenter to appear on the list, due to his other presenting roles on The One Show and the BBC's Olympics coverage.
After the publication, Sky News calculated that 45% of the BBC's best-paid stars were privately educated, compared with 6.5% of the UK population (according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency's most recent stats).
Rani herself attended a private school - last year she told The Guardian she attended Bradford Girls Grammar, which was a fee-paying school until 2013.
Earlier this year, a study carried out by the Social Mobility Commission found 66% of journalists are from professional and managerial backgrounds, with fewer than 12% from working-class backgrounds.
The BBC's most recent figures - from the corporation's Equality Information Report - suggests 75% of staff at the BBC are from a white background, while 57.8% are state educated (25.2% went to selective state schools i.e. grammar or faith and 17% were privately educated).

"Complaints about data collection by GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 were put forward by campaign group Privacy International.
The ruling said some data collection did not comply with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).
But it added that proper statutory supervision was put in place last year.
It was a ""highly significant judgement"", Privacy International said.
As part of its review of the spy agencies' activities, the IPT examined the organisations' collection of communications data - involving the ""who, where, when, how and with whom"" was involved in conversations, but not their contents - and personal information about people.
Such data is ""vital for identifying and developing intelligence targets"", according to GCHQ.
Article 8 of the ECHR states, however, that all citizens have the right to a private life and that any interference with personal data must be lawful and necessary.
""It is very significant,"" said Graham Smith of London law firm Bird & Bird.
He added that much of the data collection had been carried out under an older piece of law - section 94 of the Telecommunications Act 1984.
""It gave absolutely no clue at all that it could be used for this particular purpose,"" said Mr Smith.
""Everyone accepts that what the agencies do operationally has to be secret, but the laws that say what they can and can't do shouldn't be secret.""
An official policy about how such data collection should be carried out lawfully came into force in February 2015 - this was put into practice by the intelligence agencies later the same year.
It included guidance as to how collected data should be acquired, managed and destroyed
The tribunal found that, prior to this, personal datasets compiled by spy agencies did not comply with Article 8 and were therefore ""unlawful"".
""The powers available to the security and intelligence agencies play a vital role in protecting the UK and its citizens,"" said the Home Office in a statement.
""We are therefore pleased the tribunal has confirmed the current lawfulness of the existing bulk communications data and bulk personal dataset regimes.""
It added that the government was ""committed"" to providing greater transparency and stronger safeguards for bulk data collection powers available to intelligence agencies.","UK spy agencies broke privacy rules by collecting large amounts of UK citizens' data without adequate oversight, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) has ruled.",37680058
"Mondula, known as Mondy, has been on her own at Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling since neighbour Toto died aged 46 last March.
The park is now in contact with zoos across Europe to find company for the ""cheeky and clever"" 46-year-old.
Mondy and Toto lived together for almost 20 years.
Blair Drummond Safari Park education officer Katie Macfarlane said that, despite not being the closest of friends, Mondy was affected by Toto's death.
She told the BBC Scotland news website: ""For a few days she was quite sad and upset and you could tell she was wondering what had happened.
""In the family groups in the wild it has been seen that they mourn each other, but Toto and Mondy weren't related.
So, there were was a bond in the sense that they are very intelligent animals, but it wasn't a family bond.""
The keepers have been working with Mondy every day through training to keep her stimulated following the loss of Toto.
Miss Macfarlane said: ""In the first wee while she was a bit upset and she lost a bit of weight but she's doing really well now.""
Any potential new companion will need to be an older African elephant which recognises Mondy's dominant nature.
Miss Macfarlane said: ""It's her house, she's lived here for 20-odd years, so you've got to make sure that they're going to let her be the boss to a certain extent.
""The keepers would never want her to be on her own for the rest of her retirement, so it was always a thought from day one.
""But it takes time. You can't just throw elephants together and expect them to be friends.""

The move has also drawn criticism from Plaid Cymru AM Sian Gwenllian who said it was ""discriminatory"" in an area where a lot of people speak Welsh.
But the firm said there was no ban and it was looking into what had happened.
The notice, which was printed on Sports Direct-headed paper, said it wanted to remind staff that English was the ""official language of the company"".
""It has come to our attention that some members of staff are speaking to each other in languages other than English whilst carrying out their duties,"" it said.

"Migration Watch said given that figures for the 10-year period to 2011 were proved unreliable, it feared current estimates may be wrong.
The Office for National Statistics said it was reviewing the quality of data but could not alter the past estimates.
It has already accepted it undercounted the number of immigrants from countries which joined the EU after 2004.
In December the ONS said its figures on net migration - the number of people moving to the UK minus the number leaving - for the 10 years up to 2011 had  proved to be inaccurate.
This came after information from the 2011 Census showed the population of England and Wales grew by 464,000 more than the ONS estimated - mostly due to migration.
As Britain prepares to lift labour market restrictions on Bulgarians and Romanians next year, Sir Andrew Green - chairman of Migration Watch - says the same mistake on statistics could still be being made.
He has written to the UK Statistics Authority watchdog calling for a revision of previous immigration estimates.
""There is no point in burying bad news in obscure documents,"" Sir Andrew said. ""That simply destroys trust.
""It is hard to think of set of statistics that is more important to the public.""
But ONS head of population outputs Paul Vickers said: ""It is simply not true to suggest that ONS has 'refused' to revise migration estimates.""
An ONS spokesman told the BBC the past figures, based on surveys at ports of entry to the UK, could not be updated based on the Census statistics as the two datasets were not comparable.
Mr Vickers said improvements had been made to the ONS's data and it had already announced plans to publish a report ""analysing the quality of the long-term international migration data since 2001"" in the autumn.
The government has so far refused to put a figure on the number of Romanians and Bulgarians who could come to the UK when restrictions are lifted in January.

"Court cases for failing to send a child to school rocketed from 60 in 2007 to nearly 500 in 2011.
Merthyr Tydfil council said asking for conditional discharges had been more successful than fining parents.
But Education Minister Leighton Andrews said fines were one aspect of policy to tackle truancy.
BBC Wales' Week In Week Out went behind the scenes with Merthyr council officers, whose education department was put in special measures last month.
Suzanne Lewis has a suspended prison sentence over daughter Shauna's school attendance record.
She said: ""They want to see me getting her to the school gates. That's what we've done.
""We've got up in the morning, taken her to the school and then we've had phone calls [to] pick her back up, perhaps an hour after.
""She won't go into class with the other children and she will not do any work. I'll most probably end up in prison because of it.""
Shauna said: ""Mam shouldn't be going through that really because it's not her fault why all this has happened.
""I do feel guilty sometimes. I was scared in case they put her in prison because I don't know what I'd do without my mam.""
The council said asking magistrates to impose conditional discharge sentences - requiring parents to co-operate with the authority or face a return to court and possible jail term - has been much more successful than handing out fines.
The Welsh government has finished a consultation on Â£120 on-the-spot fines for parents who fail to send their children to school.
Councils in England issued more than 30,000 spot fines last year but attendance rates have not improved.
One parent, Gavin Vanden Berg, told the programme that he did not think fines would work. His 15-year-old son Brandon has a sporadic attendance at school.
""If a parent is really trying their best to get their child to school, other than physically taking them to the school themselves, what else can they do?"" he said.
Prof Ken Reid, an adviser to the Welsh government on its truancy and behaviour policy, said fining parents was the wrong approach.
""All the evidence from research in England is that actually they don't work at all. All the legal penalties we've had over the last 50 or 60 years on truancy have never made much difference and have never worked.""
Mike Cotton, a former school governor and father of four from Morriston, Swansea, said truancy was a ""major problem, even with quite intelligent children"", and the 700% increase was ""absolutely amazing"".
He added that parents have overall responsibility for their children, and ""teachers are there to teach, not be social workers"".
Education Minister Leighton Andrews told Week In Week Out that penalty notices were just one aspect of a national policy to tackle truancy in Wales, based on recommendations made by Prof Reid.

Air force chief of staff Agus Supriatna told MetroTV that bad weather was suspected to have caused the crash.
The Hercules was carrying food supplies from Timika to Wamena when it came down in mountainous terrain near to its destination early on Sunday.
The wreckage has been located and the bodies of the dead are being brought to Wamena,  Ivan Ahmad Riski Titus, operational director of Indonesia's search and rescue agency, told Reuters.
The flight had left Timika at 05:35 (20:35 GMT Saturday) and was expected to land in Wamena at 06:13.

"In May, the authority said it wanted to close 29 libraries and 35 children's centres as part of £200m of cuts it needs to make by 2020.
Four under-threat children's centres and Carnforth Library are to get reprieves under revised plans.
Nine women's refuges will be saved with a £1.25m funding boost.
Lancashire County Council said it was using its new prevention and early help fund to enable the refuges to continue as well as providing the same amount to help homeless people with complex needs and £500,000 for crisis support.
However, the county council is cutting funding for sheltered accommodation support in April.

"The Cultural and Heritage Day, which is being referred to on social media as Orangefest, will take place on Saturday from 09:30 until 16:30.
The Orange Order said the event was aimed at promoting better understanding of its activities and community work.
The online petition said people were ""sick"" of putting up with ""sectarian, hate-filled orange marches"".
The petition states: ""We demand that Glasgow City Council answer to the people of Glasgow as to why this was allowed to go ahead in a city centre location on a busy Saturday. Gordon Matheson (council leader) must be held accountable.""
The Orange Order described opposition to the event as ""uninformed nonsense"".
In a statement, the Order said:  ""The usual suspects have made a last-minute attempt at discrediting the event, deriding it as 'provocative' and 'divisive', and calling upon the city council to ban it.
""We have to live with the knee-jerk hostility of those who are diametrically opposed to the Order's religious and patriotic principles.
""For everyone else, this event is an open invitation to gain a better understanding of one of Glasgow's oldest and biggest fraternal and charitable organisations, warts and all.""
The Order said that ""recent government-funded studies on sectarianism advocated greater public engagement in order to tackle myths and misconceptions"" and Saturday's event was ""an honest contribution towards that end"".
It added: ""A great deal of uninformed nonsense has been spoken about the cost of this event to the public purse. We are not aware of any cost to the city. The tab is being picked up in its entirety by the membership of Glasgow's 182 Orange Lodges.""
It is understood that the Orange Order wanted to hold a community event in George Square last year but the plan could not be agreed as the city was hosting the Commonwealth Games.
Plans submitted for this year's event complied with Scottish government legislation surrounding parades and marches and council regulations on the use of George Square.
The council can charge for commercial use of the square, in front of the city chambers, but no charge applies for community events, which the Orange Order day-long celebration has been classed as.
The Order is paying its own costs with regard to setting up the square, security, power supply and clean-up costs.
A council spokesman said: ""People use George Square and other public spaces around Glasgow for a wide range of events and activities.
""Providing events are properly planned and do not encourage unlawful behaviour the council is not permitted to simply ban them on the grounds that someone dislikes, opposes or holds contrary views to the organiser.""
Police Scotland said the event on Saturday would be ""policed appropriately"".

"Both the US and British governments, of course, dispute this.
Beyond that, the MPs say Britain can and should be doing more than what the report describes as the ""striking modest"" contribution so far - a small force of Tornado bombers and Reaper drones, and a few trainers and advisers on the ground.
The MPs insists that they are not advocating conventional Western combat forces on the ground.
But they suggest Britain could step up its contribution to the air campaign, and perhaps use more special forces.
They also want more effort from Britain to develop its own analysis and strategy, rather than just ""sign-up"" to the American campaign.
In addition, they want Britain to respond to Iraqi requests for more training, including to counter Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).
And they suggest that there should be more use of particular British expertise and experience in the region, to help with analysis and planning, to restructure the Iraqi Kurdish forces who are taking on IS fighters, and to contribute more on the diplomatic front in the region.
In some ways, none of this is dramatic stuff. And the government would argue that it is weighing up further British contributions now.
And yet the doubts and criticisms remain.
In part that is because everybody agrees that this is a very difficult challenge to confront.
The MPs contrast what they see as the level of political rhetoric on the threat posed by IS with the level of effort being put in now to combating, but also how limited that is relative to the scale of the military campaign last time.
But in Washington and London, officials argue that this is a different kind of enemy this time, and that they have learned the lessons of last time.
Hence, for example, a campaign of air strikes that is not on the same scale as previous ones.
There is also an insistence that the air campaign is only a small part of the equation.
And there is general agreement that Western combat boots on the ground are not a good idea.
It is acknowledged that that is partly because of deep public and political reluctance in the West.
The key elements are getting Iraqi, Kurdish, and moderate Syrian opposition forces into shape to take on IS fighters themselves.
The support of key regional players is seen as vital. And, ultimately, there must be political change in Iraq and Syria to choke off IS support.
Washington talks about 60 or so countries across the globe being involved in the anti-IS coalition in some way or another - for example, in trying to choke off IS funding.
But the key players are a much smaller group, including those involved directly in military action.
Air strikes began in August - the Americans joined by Britain, France, and a handful of other Western countries in Iraq, and by Jordan and a number of Gulf Arab state in Syria.
US and British officials insist that they have in part halted and even reversed some IS advances.
But the key question now in Washington, London, and other capitals, is what more to do to help rebuild the weak Iraqi, Kurdish, and moderate Syrian opposition forces - how much support, for how long, and how many Western personnel will be needed?
Then there will have to be the political change in Iraq and Syria.
Some doubt whether these parts of the jigsaw can be put together.
There is the suspicion of ""mission creep"".
Then there are the strains within the coalition - with Turkey, for example, and between some Arab members of the coalition.
And Iran is a key player, but not - as far as the Americans are concerned - part of the coalition.
All this is why there remain these question marks over whether there is a clear anti-IS strategy that is realistic and workable.","In some ways, the latest House of Commons Defence Committee report on the campaign against so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria echoes the criticism that has dogged the overall US-led effort from the start: that there is no clear-cut strategy.",31147282

"They have again warned that they expect dissidents to attempt to carry out more attacks during the next few weeks.
Last Friday, a prison officer was injured in a bomb under a van.
A senior PSNI officer says they are deeply concerned by the numbers involved in dissident organisations and their increasing capabilities.
Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr said the police are preventing or disrupting three or four planned or attempted attacks for every one that takes place.
He said there are ""several hundred active dissident republicans"" who are led by a small group of people with ""significant terrorist experience"". Those individuals were previously members of the Provisional IRA.
ACC Kerr reinforced a warning from another senior PSNI officer last week that they are expecting dissidents to attempt to escalate their activities in the run-up to the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising.
""We have seen an upsurge in dissident republican activity over the last number of weeks and we anticipate that that upsurge might continue,"" he said.
The PSNI say they have what they call a ""high rate of attrition"" against dissidents, in terms of arrests, charges and the disruption of activities.
But they are concerned that dissident organisations have been able to maintain their numbers and capabilities, and have appealed to the public to help combat the threat they pose.
""There are several hundred people who can pose a significant threat to the security, to the safety, to the economic prosperity and development of Northern Ireland, and we need community support to stop these groups, to start giving us more information so that we can place more people before the courts, that's what we want to do,"" he said.
""We know communities have more information about these groupings, who they are, what they do, where they are storing the material, what their plans are.
""The best way we can combat these groups is for those communities to stop viewing the passing of information to the police service as, in some way a bad thing, a dirty word, informing or touting, and see it as a civic duty.""
But ACC Kerr said it was important to keep the level of threat posed by dissident republican groups in perspective.
He said their capabilities and the pace of their activity is not on the same scale as that of the Provisional IRA during the Troubles, and will not reach that level ""because they have very little public support"".
""In some respects they are a bit like a playground bully,"" he said.
""Everybody else in the school around them has moved on, these people just don't understand what's going on in the playground around them, but the only thing they know, the only thing they can default to is violence.
""Well that doesn't work, it didn't work in the past, it won't work now and it won't work in the future.""

"Performances should be shorter with no interval, he argues, while orchestras could drop their formal dress code.
The musician, who plays the BBC Proms next week, says the lack of new audiences has become critical.
""It's important to address this issue if we want to refresh the experience of hearing great classical music live without resorting to gimmicks.""
Writing in the Radio Times, Hough accuses the programmers of becoming stuck in their ways.
""At some point in the early 20th Century we settled into a pattern: Concerts should start early evening and last roughly two hours with a liquid interval, either to drink a glass of wine or visit the ladies / gents.
""I think we should consider removing the interval and starting either earlier or later than 7:30pm - 60 to 80 minutes of music, then out.""
Hough adds that he played such a concert with the Los Angeles Philharmonic a few months ago, ""and it felt charged with an energy that the traditional concert can sometimes lack"".
The question of how to attract younger audiences has vexed classical musicians for years.
The focus usually turns to new ways of presenting music, such as last year's blockbuster Ibiza Prom; or educational outreach programmes, like the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic's ""In Harmony"" project, which uses music-making to improve the health, education and aspirations of children and young people in Everton.
But shorter performances have proved effective in attracting new audiences for the Montreal Symphony in Canada, which holds an annual festival called ""Viree Classique"" (Classical Spree) every summer.
The event boasts 30 concerts in 30 hours, all within walking distance of each other, with reduced ticket prices and a time limit of 45 minutes.
Reviewing this year's event, critic Paul Wells observed that the children he brings to the concerts ""like classical music well enough, but like a lot of ordinary people, they find a regular-length symphony concert a bit of a chore"".
""But at the Viree classique, at just about the time an ordinary person starts to wonder when the concert will end, it ends.""
In his Radio Times column, Hough points out that shorter performances could even allow for two performances in one evening, boosting revenues for concert halls.
The pianist plays his the BBC Proms for the 25th time next Tuesday, 23 August, with a programme featuring Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov and Prokofiev. There will be an interval.

"There were fears that the probe might hit fragments of ice or rock, and that these could cause significant damage.
Cassini made the plunge with its radio dish pointing forward like a shield.
But the latest analysis indicates there were hardly any impacts and those particles the probe did strike were only smoke-sized.
""The region between the rings and Saturn is 'the big empty,' apparently,"" commented Cassini project manager, Earl Maize, of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
""Cassini will stay the course, while the scientists work on the mystery of why the dust level is much lower than expected.""
The outcome is good news because four of the remaining gap-runs that Cassini will execute before terminating its mission in September will edge even closer to Saturn’s inner D-ring.
These manoeuvres also are expected to see the probe lead with its antenna in the shield configuration.
But last Wednesday’s experience means controllers can now approach these events with increased confidence.
Cassini is booked to make a further 21 plunges through the 3,000km-wide opening between the planet's cloudtops and the D-ring, with the next occurring at 19:38 GMT On Tuesday.
The dives are designed to return data of unprecedented resolution on the structure and dynamics of Saturn’s interior.
They should also allow the probe to weigh the rings, which will give scientists their best estimate yet for the age of these spectacular bands.
Currently, no-one is quite sure whether the rings are as old as the planet or are a relatively recent phenomenon, the result perhaps of a break-up of a moon or even a comet that got too close to the giant world.
Nasa intends to dump Cassini in the atmosphere of Saturn on 15 September.
After 20 years in space, the satellite is running low on fuel and controllers want to be sure there is no possibility of a future collision with the moons of Titan and Enceladus, which could conceivably support simple microbial life.

"William Morva, 35, is scheduled to die for the 2006 killings of a security guard and a sheriff's deputy during his attempted escape from a hospital.
The deputy's daughter said she is among the thousands urging Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe to grant clemency.
But the deputy's mother said she does not want Morva's life to be spared.
Morva was awaiting trial on 2005 robbery charges when he was taken to the hospital for an injury.
He attacked a sheriff's deputy, stole the official's gun and fatally shot hospital security guard Derrick McFarland, who was unarmed.
Before he was captured near Virginia Tech's Blacksburg campus a day later, Morva shot Sheriff's Deputy Eric Sutphin in the back of the head.
Morva's lawyers argue he suffers from delusional disorder, which is similar to schizophrenia, adding that his condition has worsened because prison doctors have refused to treat him.
They asked Governor McAuliffe to commute his sentence, contending a jury that convicted him without knowing the severity of his condition.
But the governor of Virginia has refused to grant a last-minute stay of execution.
Morva is scheduled to die by lethal injection at 21:00 local time (1:00 GMT).
More than 34,000 people petitioned the Democrat to halt Thursday's execution, including the slain deputy's daughter, Rachel Sutphin.
""I am against the death penalty for religious and moral reasons,"" Ms Sutphin said in an email to reporters.
""I have fought and will continue to fight for clemency for all death row inmates until Virginia declares the death penalty unconstitutional.
""I have sent my own letter to the Governor showing my support for clemency.""
But the deputy's mother, Jeaneen Sutphin, said while she sympathises with Morva's family, she wants the scheduled lethal injection to proceed.
""I have no hatred for this creature who shot him execution-style. I just want justice for my son,"" she told the Roanoke Times on Wednesday.
The jury that convicted Morva was told he suffered from a personality disorder that resulted in ""odd beliefs"", but he later was diagnosed with a more severe mental illness,
The US Supreme Court declined to hear Morva's appeal in February.
National mental health advocates, 20 Virginia lawmakers and two United Nations human rights experts have joined calls to block his execution.
The government of Hungary, where Morva is a dual citizen, and the European Union have also urged the governor to intervene.
""We are concerned at Mr Morva's deteriorating psychosocial condition,"" UN Special Rapporteurs Agnes Callamard and Dainius PÃ»ras said in a statement on Wednesday.
""The denial of reasonable accommodation in detention can be considered a form of discrimination against him because of his mental health condition.""

"The UK Home Care Association calculated the minimum price councils should be paying was £16.70 per hour, but the average was over £2 less.
Councils said they had been left with little choice given the squeeze on their finances by the government.
But the UKHCA said the situation was threatening the future of the market.
It warned agencies were struggling to recruit staff and maintain quality, noting growing numbers of organisations were handing back contracts to councils.
It comes after the Care Quality Commission said earlier in the month the sector was at ""tipping point"" with cuts leading to more pressure on hospitals and deteriorating performance.
Kimberley Hassall works for Somerset Care, a social enterprise which provides home care for councils across the south of England.
She says because of the pressures in the system, there is simply not enough time to do everything she wants to do, and so she has to prioritise things like medication.
""I do feel with some people you would want an extra half an hour just so you can put the washing on, change the bed or change their clothes.""
She says there is constant ""juggling"" to make sure she can see all her clients. ""You have to be clock-watching,"" she added.
Her bosses agree. Currently 80% of the work Somerset Care does is council-funded, but it is looking to shift the balance much more towards private clients in the future as the agency feels it cannot maintain the quality of care with the fees being offered.
The home care market looks after nearly 900,000 people, providing help for daily tasks such as washing and dressing. About 80% are funded by local councils.
The UKHCA asked all 208 councils about the fees they paid, with 186 providing data under the Freedom of Information Act.
It bases its £16.70 minimum price on the cost of paying carers the national living wage and running costs for the businesses with a profit margin of 50p an hour.
The average paid by councils was £14.58 an hour, with Sefton, South Tyneside, North Tyneside and Blackburn paying the least at under £12.
The average is higher than it was 18 months ago when the UKHCA last did this survey, but the number of councils not paying a ""fair price"" has increased because the rise has not kept pace with the increased costs that come from paying the national living wage, the UKHCA said.

Savings, investments and income are assessed, along with the value of your home - unless you or a close relative live there.
Colin Angel, of the UKHCA, said another £500m needed to be invested in the market to bring the fees up to a sustainable level.
""Underfunded home care is an urgent situation, which must not be allowed to continue,"" he added.
A Department of Health spokeswoman said the government was ""committed"" to providing high quality and dignified home care.
She said money was coming into the sector through the Better Care Fund, which is largely funded by the NHS to encourage joint working between councils and the health service.
Local authorities have also been allowed to increase council tax by 2% a year this Parliament to pay for social care - although councils have claimed this is not enough to plug the shortfall in their care budgets because of the wider squeeze on their funding.
A Local Government Association spokesman added: ""The market for publicly-funded care is simply not sustainable as it stands.""

"Ed Wood, a Derby County fan, first set the Guinness World record in 1992 but was beaten a few years later.
Now he has set off to visit 93 grounds - all 92 in the English Premier and Football leagues, as well as English-based Scottish club Berwick Rangers.
The current record is 237 days, set by Ken Ferris in the 1994-95 season.
The loans manager, from Leeds, said he waited ten years to restart his quest because his girlfriend threatened ""to dump"" him if he did.
She has since relented and he has already visited 11 grounds this season.
Mr Wood, who did a ""virtual"" tour of the grounds last year to give him an idea of how it would work, hopes to finish in February but is not sure which ground will be his last.
He said: ""Actually, getting tickets to the games isn't as easy as you might think - partly because fixtures can change.

""I was worried I wouldn't be able to get tickets for the Man U game - I thought it might be was sold out.""
Mr Wood, who is raising money for a prostate cancer charity, said he took on the challenge for several reasons, but mainly because he has just turned 50 and recently broke his arm in a cycling accident so he ""was ready for a bit of a break"".
He has budgeted Â£10,000 for his challenge, but said so far he has only had two tickets for free.

"The plan has been dropped in response to criticism that it would penalise aid agencies, the finance minister said.
The controversial measure was announced just four days after famine was declared in parts of the country.
However, the revised fee will be reviewed by MPs and could be introduced at a later date.
Foreign workers are currently required to pay $100 (Â£80) for a work permit.
South Sudanese officials argued that the fee was one of the lowest in the region hence suggesting the 100-fold increase.
But the fee hike faced criticism with people saying that it would burden aid workers at a time when the country was most at need.
Finance Minister Stephen Dhieu Dau acknowledged the complaint as part of the reason why the fee increase has been dropped.
""The ministry of finance acknowledges these significant issues... and steps are being taken to formulate the best way forward,"" Mr Dau said.
Even before the uproar over the fee increase, the officials of the famine-stricken country had been accused of impeding access for humanitarian agencies.
South Sudan is currently facing food shortages and parts of the country are experiencing a famine.

"They have released excerpts of a new report that raises concerns about the failure to share intelligence that they say could have prevented the bombing.
Their call for a public inquiry has been backed by Amnesty International.
The Real IRA bomb killed 29 people in 1998. One was pregnant with twins.
It was the worst atrocity during more than 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland.
The families of those killed still believe the full truth of the events surrounding the bombing has never been revealed.
Over a year ago they presented a report to the British and Irish governments as part of their campaign for a full public inquiry.
On Thursday, just a few days before the 15th anniversary of the bombing, they revealed some of that document that they say shows there was substantial intelligence warning that dissident republicans were planning an attack.
However, they believe information was not shared between police forces north and south of the border and intelligence services, including the FBI and MI5.
They said that the attack could have been prevented and the failure to reveal more about what was known had prevented anyone from being criminally convicted of the killings.
Michael Gallagher, of the Omagh Support and Self Help Group, called on the British and Irish governments to share what they knew at the time.
The car bomb attack on 15 August 1998 also injured 220 people.

"Banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) are increasingly using chatbots to answer customer queries.
The report examined the views of 600 bankers and other experts.
Many, perhaps ironically, felt that AI would help banks create a more human-like customer experience.
""The big paradox here is that people think technology will lead to banking becoming more and more automated and less and less personalised, but what we've seen coming through here is the view that technology will actually help banking become a lot more personalised,"" said Alan McIntyre, head of the Accenture's banking practice and co-author of the report, Banking Technology Vision 2017.
""(It) will give people the impression that the bank knows them a lot better, and in many ways it will take banking back to the feeling that people had when there were more human interactions.""
A similar report conducted by Accenture, looking at consumer attitudes to banking, suggests that customers too are willing to embrace AI.
""With things like Netflix, customers are used to smart AI offering advice in the background and we found consumers are surprisingly willing to accept robotic advice about banking products,"" Mr McIntyre told the BBC.
In future he envisages banking will be made much simpler - with people able to conduct transactions on social media platforms such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp.
Accenture is currently working with a number of UK banks to allow customers to interact with their banks - get balance information and transfer money - via Amazon's smart home speaker Alexa.
He also imagines how banks could use systems such as Alexa to transcribe conversations with customers to cut down on ""form-filling"".
""Rather than sit down and log on to a website, people want to interact naturally,"" said Mr McIntyre.
The vast majority of customers, according to Accenture, want both easy digital interactions and the ability to speak to a human.
""People want a dialogue and as AI is more and more able to replicate that, so it doesn't feel like speaking to a machine,"" he said.
RBS and NatWest began testing an AI customer service chatbot, dubbed Assist, in December and in Sweden, Swedbank's Nina web assistant now has an average of 30,000 conversations per month and can handle more than 350 different customer questions.","Artificial intelligence will be the main way that banks interact with their customers within the next three years, a report from consultancy Accenture has suggested.",39419727
"It follows the publication of letters between the boss of Cluff Natural Resources and Scottish ministers.
They show that the day after a ban on unconventional oil and gas was announced, Cluff warned that plans to invest more than Â£250m were at risk.
WWF Scotland said plans to burn coal under the sea should be a non-starter.
No-one at Cluff Natural Resources was available for comment on the letters.
In the communications from January this year, Algy Cluff, the comany's founder, said he wanted assurances from ministers that the ban on unconventional oil and gas - often referred to as fracking - would not apply to underground coal gasification (UCG).
The UCG process attempt to reach reserves of coal which are inaccessible to mine, in this case under the waters of the Forth estuary.
It involves chemically converting the coal from a solid state into gas by pumping oxygen and steam through a small borehole into the coal seam.
Environmental campaigners have said UCG should be included in the fracking moratorium.
Mr Cluff's letter has been released following a freedom of information request from anti-fracking campaigners.
It has been published by The Ferret, an investigative journalism website, along with the reply sent by Alex Neil MSP, the Cabinet secretary responsible for planning.
In his response, Mr Neil gave Mr Cluff an assurance the moratorium was ""specifically about the onshore exploration, appraisal, and production of coal bed methane and shale oil and gas.""
He added: ""The moratorium does not apply to the offshore underground gasification of coal.""
Powers to licence onshore unconventional oil and gas developments are being devolved to the Scottish government. But UCG licences will continue to be issued by the Coal Authority.
A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""The development of new energy technologies, such as underground coal gasification, must be consistent with our environmental objectives and we will continue to take a careful, evidence-based approach to such developments.""
Meanwhile, the SNP MP for Edinburgh East, Tommy Sheppard, has described UCG as ""more problematic"" than fracking because of the ""threat of underground explosions and geological trauma"".
Mr Sheppard also suggested the Scottish government's moratorium could be applied to UCG.
He told BBC Scotland: ""If you are going to drill shafts onshore, before going offshore, you are going to need planning permission for that and, in my mind, that would most definitely be unconventional gas extraction and it would be covered by the moratorium.
""There's a big debate going on within the SNP, as there is within wider Scottish society, about whether or not these new technologies have a role to play, whether the benefits outweigh the risks, and that debate is going on in great detail within my local community and within my party.
""I have pretty much made up my mind on this and I am on one side of that debate and that's purely because of the evidence I have been shown over the last 18 months.""
Environmentalists insist the time has come for the Scottish government to rule out UCG.
They argue it already has the power to do so under the existing planning laws governing related developments onshore.
Lang Banks, director of WWF Scotland, said: ""No company should ever be allowed to hold Scottish ministers or Scotland's environment to ransom like this.
""This latest revelation again highlights why plans to burn coal under the sea should be a non-starter, and why the Scottish government must extend its moratorium on unconventional gas extraction to include underground coal gasification.
""The science is clear, to protect our climate the vast majority of fossil fuel reserves must remain unburned. In a worst case scenario, proposals such as these could even extend our use of fossil fuels, locking us into a high-carbon world.""
No-one from Cluff Natural Resources was available for comment.","Environmentalists have accused the firm behind plans to use coal seams beneath the Forth to produce gas of ""attempting to hold Scotland to ransom"".",33698403
"But members of the Scottish Parliament's finance committee warned it was ""too early to draw any definitive conclusions"".
They have been scrutinising the introduction of the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT).
It replaced stamp duty north of the border in April 2015.
The committee now asked the Scottish Government to provide more detailed information on the impact of the new system.
Finance Secretary Derek Mackay told the committee that nearly 9,700 homebuyers who would have had to pay stamp duty did not have to pay LBTT when buying a home, and that a further 41,700 paid less as a result of changes to the charges for properties costing between £145,000 and £325,000
Now MSPs want to know the impact the change has had on the first-time buyer market, as there are no fees on properties worth up to £145,000, and if this has contributed to increased house prices.
They also suggested that the government's review of the LBTT should consider if there is any behaviour response to the changes, particularly in relation to properties costing between £325,000 and £750,000, where the charges have increased.
Ministers have also been challenged to respond to claims from the Scottish Fiscal Commission that the housing market for more expensive homes, costing between £325,000 and £750,000 ""remained subdued throughout the entire fiscal year excluding March 2016"".
Finance Committee convener Bruce Crawford said: ""It's reasonable to say year one of the LBTT went smoothly and was operationally successful.
""That said, a key challenge for us has been the lack of consistency in the presentation of data relating to LBTT. That made it difficult to compare forecast and outturn data and to fully assess the tax's impact on the property market in Scotland.
""There are also challenges in identifying 'causality' for the changes seen in the housing market - in short, it's difficult, based on the data, to separate out the impact of LBTT rates and bands from extraneous factors, such as the general economic situation.
""Our committee therefore recommends that the Scottish government's review of the first year of LBTT includes an analysis of the behavioural response to LBTT, particularly in relation to homes costing between £325,000 and £750,000.
""This should include an assessment of the likelihood of an on-going response and an analysis of the impact of extraneous factors.""","The introduction of a new property tax has been ""operationally successful"", according to MSPs on a key Holyrood committee.",38200988

"The Italian, 55, led Real to victory in the Spanish Cup before claiming the club's 10th European Cup last season.
But this year they were knocked out by Juventus in the Champions League semi-finals, while Barcelona won La Liga.
Napoli boss Rafael Benitez is the favourite to take over the vacant role once the Italian season ends.
Ancelotti's side finished second in Spain's top flight, two points behind Barca, who have reached the Spanish Cup and Champions League finals.
Club president Florentino Perez told a news conference it had ""not been an easy decision"" before thanking Ancelotti and adding that a new manager would be appointed ""next week"".
""What did Ancelotti do wrong? I don't know,"" Perez added. ""The demands here at Real Madrid are very high. The affection that the players and the fans have for Carlo is the same as the affection I myself have for him.""
Real beat city rivals Atletico Madrid 4-1 after extra time in the Champions League final in June 2014 to claim 'La Decima' - their 10th victory in Europe's most prestigious club competition.
It was Ancelotti's third Champions League title as a manager - he also won it twice with AC Milan, in 2003 and 2007 - but he leaves Madrid having failed to claim the Spanish title since joining from Paris St-Germain in July 2013.
The former Chelsea boss, whose contract was due to run until the end of next season, also won the Club World Cup in December before Real were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Atletico in January.
In an interview with Italian newspaper Il Giornale published on Monday morning, before his departure was announced, Ancelotti said he would take a year off and have back surgery if he left Real.
""I must have a back operation because of spinal stenosis that for some time creates a tingle in my hands,"" he said.
""I don't know how long the period of recovery will be,"" he added. ""I can assure you that I've had plenty of offers from Italy, England, Germany. I'm sure they will not be lacking from here until next year.""
Spanish football expert Andy West: ""In one sense, Ancelotti's departure was inevitable because all-powerful Real president Florentino Perez appears to have taken the decision a while ago.
""Even in mid-March, Perez would only assert that Ancelotti would be in charge for the next few 'days and weeks', and from that moment it seemed certain the Italian's fate rested on his team's ability to win either the Champions League or La Liga.
""With both those trophies escaping Real's grasp, Monday's news is no surprise. But the stubborn Perez has been forced to withstand an unexpectedly strong degree of public and private pressure because Ancelotti remained highly popular to the end.
""His last pre-game news conference on Friday ended with the media giving him a standing ovation, which was subsequently repeated by fans before Saturday's game against Getafe at the Bernabeu.
""Then several players voiced their support for the coach, most notably Cristiano Ronaldo and James Rodriguez.
""But Perez ignored all of them, and now faces a tough task in placating those within and outside his organisation who wanted to keep Ancelotti by appointing a suitable replacement. And the early signs are that Rafa Benitez would receive little more than a lukewarm reception.""",Carlo Ancelotti has been sacked as manager of Real Madrid after two seasons in charge of the Spanish club.,32877349

"They face charges in connection with trouble surrounding a disputed Orange Order parade in the north of the city.
Nearly all of the suspects are accused of riotous assembly in the Ardoyne area.
Three of the defendants have been charged with similar offences in the Oldpark district.
Some of the accused face further allegations of having petrol bombs and damage to a police land rover.
One of them is also charged with hijacking a car during the disturbances.
Vehicles were seized and burnt out, and police attacked with petrol bombs, paint bombs and fireworks during three nights of violence last July.
During a preliminary enquiry hearing at Belfast Magistrates' Court on Friday, one of the accused repeatedly demanded to know whether any charges had been brought over trouble in other parts of the city.
At one stage he shouted out: ""The PSNI have been putting us down for years.
""Has anybody been charged from east Belfast, their riots?""
District Judge George Conner warned the accused that he had the power to hold him in contempt of court.
Mr Conner ruled there was a prima facie case against all 24 defendants.
He granted a prosecution application to have the men returned for trial at Belfast Crown Court on a date to be fixed.

"The typical property cost 7.6 times average annual earnings of employees in England and Wales, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
The aftermath of the financial crisis saw affordability levels plateau.
But now buyers face paying a record multiple of earnings as the affordability gap widens.
In 2007, the typical buyer faced paying 7.2 times their earnings on a property, but this was surpassed in 2015 (7.4 times) and again in 2016 (7.6 times).
The official figures will make gloomy reading for potential first-time buyers whose wages have stagnated and who now see property ownership become comparatively more expensive.
However, borrowing costs are at historic lows with banks and building societies cutting interest rates on mortgages to attract customers.
A recent report by Shelter suggested that nearly eight out of 10 families across England are unable to afford newly built homes in their local area.
Northampton is the fastest-moving property market in the UK, according to analysis of listings on a property portal.
Zoopla calculated the length of time that properties were listed on its website before being marked as under offer.
Typically, among towns and cities across the country, properties in Northampton were listed for the shortest amount of time, 27 days.
Milton Keynes (29 days) and Croydon (30 days) were next on the list.
Regionally, properties on the site came under offer fastest in the South East of England and the East of England (42 days) compared with the longest - Wales - which took 66 days.
The ONS figures show that London hosts seven of the 10 least affordable areas to buy a property in England and Wales last year.
In Kensington and Chelsea, the typical property costs 38 times the average annual income of residents in the area. In 1999, a home cost 13 times typical earnings.
Buyers in Westminster had to pay 24 times typical earnings for the area last year, and it was 21 times multiple in Hammersmith and Fulham.
At the other end of the scale, buyers Copeland in Cumbria had to pay 2.8 times typical local earnings for a home.
Next on the affordability list were the Welsh council areas of Neath Port Talbot and Blaenau Gwent (both 3.6 times).
Property commentator Henry Pryor argues that affordability levels are less relevant for some buyers.
""Up to 40% of buyers do not have a mortgage, they are cash buyers for whom affordability isn't an issue and for whom there is no link to their income,"" he said.
""Half of people who own a home have no borrowings. The unearned and largely untaxed money they have made simply by living in their property isn't recorded in inflation figures but it is a significant part of what maintains house prices and drives the economy.""
Roger Harding, of Shelter, said: ""The only way to fix the housing crisis is for the government to get behind a different way of building that brings down the cost of land.""

"However, she is already a familiar face to women's soccer fans in the USA.
Daly plays her club football for Houston Dash in the National Women's Super League, alongside the likes of Fifa Player of the Year Carli Lloyd.
And the 24-year-old now wants to make a name for herself on this side of the Atlantic, by becoming a regular in the England team.
""It's every kid's dream to play for their country, that's what you should work towards,"" she told BBC Sport.
Daly, originally from Harrogate, started out as a left-back at Leeds United Ladies and also played play for Lincoln in the Women's Super League before moving five years ago to attend college in New York.
After converting to a striker and setting numerous goal-scoring records for St John's University, she became in January the first British player to ever earn a draft selection.
She was snapped up by Houston as the sixth pick, something Daly describes as ""huge"".
It didn't take her long to show why Dash wanted her, scoring and setting up another for Lloyd in their opening game of the season.
And Daly relishes lining up alongside the world's best player.
""At first it was like 'wow, you're the world player of the year' but once I started to play with her, I just got into a rhythm with her, For my own development and improvement, it's going to be massive with her around.""
Daly's impressive form was rewarded by England Women's manager Mark Sampson, when she was given her international debut in their Euro 2017 qualifier against Serbia.
Not only did the forward receive a good luck message from rock star Robbie Williams before the game, but she also scored in the 7-0 victory, a ""massive"" moment, she says.
""It's every kid's dream,"" she continued.
""To get my debut in front of a home crowd, in front of my family and to get a goal too is a dream come true for me"".
Daly now says she's focused on becoming a consistent part of Sampson's plans.
""This is what I've worked hard for. I've concentrated on myself a lot over the last few years, in terms of my maturity levels, on and off the field,"" she said.
""I want to make a name for myself and be a regular, not just make up the numbers"".
Daly says she is ""loving"" life in her first season at Houston and has no immediate plans to return to England, despite having offers from WSL clubs.
However, she admits that if playing her club football abroad ever affected her chances of another England call-up, then she would think about returning.
""If it was what was required of me, I'd definitely consider coming back. It's not that I'm set in the US, but I love my life out there,"" she said.
""But Mark is pretty good with me being overseas. He's keeps an eye on me, especially with the games being streamed now, so hopefully I can find a way of tying both in"".",Rachel Daly may have scored on her England debut but some supporters of the Lionesses may know relatively little about the striker.,36456967
"In a televised address, Ms Park apologised formally for the sinking.
A new safety agency would handle rescue duties, with investigative functions passing to the police, she said.
The Sewol ferry disaster on 16 April killed 286 passengers, most of whom were high school students. Another 18 are still missing.
""The ultimate responsibility of the poor response to this accident lies with me,"" Ms Park said.
She said the coastguard had ""failed to fulfil its original duties"" and ""had it actively carried out rescue efforts immediately after the accident"", more lives could have been saved.
Ms Park added that in its current form, the coastguard would be unable to prevent another large-scale disaster.
""The coastguard continued to get bigger in size but did not have enough personnel and budget allocated for maritime safety, and training for rescue was very much insufficient,"" she said, according to Reuters.
Ms Park's office told agencies that her plans had to be approved by the National Assembly, in which her Saenuri party maintains a majority.
The planned disbanding of the coastguard is one of several reforms the South Korean leader announced on Monday.
An interim investigation found that the ferry was overloaded, carrying three times its approved amount of cargo, and that a sharp turn destabilised it and caused it to capsize.
Officials from the ferry's operator and a company that conducted safety checks on the vessel prior to the incident have also been arrested.
""A 20-year-old vessel was bought and refurbished to add excessive capacity, then it was loaded with much more cargo than allowed with a false reporting on weight, but not a single person in the position to supervise stopped any of it,"" Ms Park said.
She said she planned to increase restrictions on government officials taking up jobs related to their duties after retirement. The practice, also known as ""bureaucratic mafia"" in South Korea, is seen as fostering too-cosy ties between bureaucrats and regulators.
The accident showed ""how big a calamity can be brought about by the abnormal practice of collusion between the government and civilians"", she was quoted as saying by Yonhap news agency.
The president also proposed establishing a committee to look into whether the Sewol ferry accident was caused by corruption and other irregularities.
Ms Park's administration has been the subject of continued criticism over the accident, particularly on the speed of search and rescue operations, despite earlier apologies from her and the resignation of Prime Minister Chung Hong-won.
Only 172 passengers survived the sinking of the ferry, including 22 of the 29 crew members.
The ferry captain and three members of the crew have been charged with manslaughter.  Prosecutors have indicted another 11 crew members for negligence, for failing to evacuate passengers.","South Korea plans to break up its coastguard in the wake of the ferry disaster in which more than 300 people died, says President Park Geun-hye.",27465378
"The four and five-year-old children from Devon were weighed and measured as part of the government's National Childhood Measurement Programme.
Parents of children at Tor Bridge Primary School contacted The Plymouth Herald about the letters.
Plymouth's director of public health Dr Ruth Harrell said support was in place for parents to discuss the results.
Click here for more on this story, and other stories from across Devon and Cornwall.
School nurses working for Livewell South West sent out the letters as part of the Public Health England scheme.
Teri Sanders, mother of Archi Sanders who attends the school said: ""According to the NHS guidelines, my son needed to be one stone lighter to be a perfect weight.
""I can understand why the NHS needs to warn parents or give a guideline, but I think it's disgusting that they can label my son very overweight.""
Sarah Tall, whose four-year-old daughter Roxanne attends the school, put her child's details into an NHS healthy weight calculator, which confirmed the findings.
""She hasn't got an ounce of fat on her,"" Ms Tall said.
""My main worry is if a child is at an age where they can be very self conscious, it would affect them.
""If they're telling us our children are overweight, they should be a bit more sensitive.""
The results are posted to parents and are not given to the children themselves or to the school.
Dr Ruth Harrell, Plymouth City Council's director of public health, said some parents might be ""surprised"" by their child's result.
""The measurement that we perform is our best estimate of the amount of excess weight that a child is carrying, but very occasionally might not be giving us the full picture.""
Jake Franklin, aged five, was also classed as ""very overweight"", although his mother Kelly said it is ""the least of his worries"".
Jake underwent nine hours of brain surgery when he was a baby and has several learning difficulties.
Kelly said: ""I didn't expect it to be written like that. I would like a formal apology for the way it was handled.

"She was a regular and enthusiastic visitor to Glamis Castle in Angus, the home of her mother's family, as she revealed in a letter to her grandparents.
""Darling Granny: Thank you very, very much for having us to stay with you at Glamis.
""It was one of the happiest weeks I have ever spent.
""With lots of love, from Lillibet.""
That letter was written when the Queen was 11 and staying at Balmoral Castle, another of her favourite places.
Scotland has always also played a significant role in her Royal duties.
When she became Queen, on the death of her father King George VI, one of her first official tasks was to plant a cherry tree at the Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh, the parish church for the Palace of Holyrood House.
And after the Coronation, the first to be televised live, huge crowds lined the streets of the Scottish capital as she received the Honours of Scotland - the Scottish crown, sceptre and sword of state.
When she travelled to Glasgow, the city's George Square was so packed with well-wishers that 300 people were injured in the crush.
But Richard Finlay, professor of History at Strathclyde University, said there was also controversy during the early years of the Queen's reign.
""There was the optimism because she was young, it was after the war, she represented youth and hope and aspiration.
""But her Royal advisors put their foot in it by insisting on the numeral two, and of course there hadn't been an Elizabeth who was Queen of Scotland before.
""And many middle class Scots got quite irate about this, because it was seen to be ignoring Scottish history.""
He said there were attempts to blow up pillar boxes with the EIIR emblem on them and anger when, in a Christmas message from New Zealand, the Queen described herself as Queen of England.
Over the years, affection for the monarch, and interest in her visits to Scotland have waxed and waned.
But Professor Christopher Smout, the Historiographer Royal, told the BBC the Queen has embraced the new Scotland and has opened each session of the new Holyrood Parliament.
He said this showed her abiding interest in what happens in her northern kingdom.
""People in Scotland don't appreciate the degree to which she is Queen of Scotland.
""This is really very odd since she is descended from Scottish kings like Robert the Bruce for example, and she is not descended from horrible English kings like Henry VIII.""
During her long reign, the Queen has visited almost every part of Scotland, receiving bouquets and less traditional gifts, launching ships, opening bridges and buildings, like the new Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow.
And she always spends a summer holiday in Scotland, whether touring the Western Isles in the Royal Yacht Britannia or staying at Balmoral.
Crowds along the Borders rail route, which the Queen officially opened, offered testament to her abiding appeal.
But Richard Finlay warned against conflating Elizabeth the person with the institution of monarchy when they are quite distinct things.
""The only idea people have of monarchy is the current Queen,"" he said.
""While the Queen may be popular as an individual, there is a tendency to translate that as support for the institution of monarchy.
""The big issue will be when the Queen goes and you have the issue of succession.
""There will be a lot of expectation, and re-evaluation about what we expect from the institution of monarchy, because it won't be the same.""",Scotland has held a special place in the Queen's affections from a very young age.,34196921

President: Salvador Sanchez Ceren
A former rebel leader, Salvador Sanchez Ceren won the presidential run-off of March 2014 by a narrow margin.
As presidential candidate of the left-wing Farabundo Marti Liberation Front (FMLN), he beat Norman Quijano of the conservative Arena party by less than a quarter of a percentage point, becoming the first former guerrilla to lead the Central American country.
In his inauguration speech, he promised to fight corruption and violence, and ""to serve as president of all Salvadoreans"".
Press freedom is guaranteed under the constitution, and the media freely and routinely criticise the government and report on opposition activities.
But ownership of broadcasting outlets is concentrated among a small group of private operators, and media owners ""often impose controls on journalists to protect their political or economic interests"", according to US-based Freedom House.
Some key dates in the history of El Salvador:
1540 - El Salvador becomes a Spanish colony after indigenous resistance is crushed.
1821 - Independence from Spain.
1823 - 1840 - El Salvador forms part of the short-lived United Provinces of Central America, which also includes Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.
1859-63 - President Gerardo Barrios introduces coffee growing.
1932 - Some 30,000 people are killed during the suppression of a peasant uprising led by Agustine Farabundo Marti.
1969 - Football War with Honduras; 4,000 die in 100-hour conflict.
1979 - 1992 - Civil war. Between 1979 and 1981 around 30,000 people are killed by army-backed right-wing death squads.
2009 - Former FMLN rebel movement emerges as largest party in parliamentary elections and shortly afterwards former rebel Mauricio Funes wins presidential elections.

"Ibrahim Sharif, a former secretary-general of the National Democratic Action Society, was arrested after making a speech calling for reform.
He was also accused of incitement to overthrow the government by force, but the court dismissed the charge.
Mr Sharif gave the speech in July, a month after being released from prison for his role in the 2011 uprising.
Bahrain has been racked by unrest since February 2011, when demonstrators occupied Manama's Pearl Roundabout, demanding greater political rights and an end to discrimination against the majority Shia community by the Sunni royal family.
The protesters were driven out by security forces the following month, after the king brought in troops from neighbouring Sunni-led Gulf states to restore order and crush dissent.
At least 89 people have been killed in clashes with security forces since 2011, while hundreds have been arrested and put on trial, activists say.
Mr Sharif was charged with ""incitement to hatred and contempt of the regime"" and ""incitement to overthrow the regime by force and illegal means"" after giving a speech at a public gathering to commemorate the death of a 16-year-old boy shot by riot police in 2012.
In the speech, he spoke about the need for change in Bahrain, highlighted the political opposition's commitment to non-violence and urged the government to introduce key economic reforms, according to Amnesty International.
""The sentencing of Ibrahim Sharif to yet another year in prison simply for calling for reform in a speech is an outrageous attack on freedom of expression and the latest example of the Bahraini authorities' insidious clampdown on government critics,"" said the human rights group's Middle East and North Africa deputy director, James Lynch.
""No-one should be imprisoned for peacefully expressing their views. Ibrahim Sharif's conviction is a blatant attempt to punish him for speaking out, serving as a warning to all dissidents, and must be quashed immediately.""
Mr Sharif's arrest and detention in July came less than a month after he had been released from prison following a royal pardon.
He had served four years of a five-year sentence handed to him after what Amnesty described as an unfair trial that saw him and 20 other opposition activists involved in the 2011 protests found guilty of attempting to change the constitution and monarchical system ""by force"".
Last June, the secretary-general of Bahrain's main opposition party, Wefaq, was sentenced to four years in jail on similar charges of inciting hatred, inciting others to disobey the law, and publicly insulting the interior ministry.

"Couples will now be allowed to have two children, it said, citing a statement from the Communist Party.
The controversial policy was introduced nationally in 1979, to slow the population growth rate.
It is estimated to have prevented about 400 million births. However concerns at China's ageing population led to pressure for change.
Couples who violated the one-child policy faced a variety of punishments, from fines and the loss of employment to forced abortions.
Over time, the policy has been relaxed in some provinces, as demographers and sociologists raised concerns about rising social costs and falling worker numbers.
The decision to allow families to have two children was designed ""to improve the balanced development of population'' and to deal with an aging population, according to the statement from the Community Party's Central Committee carried by the official Xinhua News Agency (in Chinese) on Thursday.
Currently about 30% of China's population is over the age of 50. The total population of the country is around 1.36 billion.
The Communist Party began formally relaxing national rules two years ago, allowing couples in which at least one of the pair is an only child to have a second child.
China's one-child policy
What was China's one-child policy?
Trauma and sympathy shared online
Correspondents say that despite the relaxation of the rules, many couples may opt to only have one child, as one-child families have become the social norm.
Critics say that even a two-child policy will not boost the birth rate enough, the BBC's John Sudworth reports.
And for those women who want more than two children, nor will it end the state's insistence on the right to control their fertility, he adds.
""As long as the quotas and system of surveillance remains, women still do not enjoy reproductive rights,"" Maya Wang of Human Rights Watch told AFP.
I was born in 1979, the year the one-child policy was implemented. And even then, I wasn't supposed to be born.
In my parents' work unit, there were also quotas for babies. By the time my mother announced her pregnancy, the quotas were all used up for the year.
But kind-hearted officials decided to look the other way and allowed my birth. My would-be siblings were less lucky.
As a result of the policy, my mother had to endure two abortions. Even today, she talks about 'Number Two' and 'Number Three' and what they might have been like.

"Experts believe it could be ""Scotland's Glastonbury"", a reference to the lake village in Somerset.
The excavation was part-financed with Â£15,000 from Historic Scotland.
Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop described the village discovery at Black Loch of Myrton as ""an exciting and unexpected find"".
The dig was carried out this summer by AOC Archaeology Group, which hopes to use the pilot excavation as the starting point for a broader programme of archaeological activity.
It is one of 55 archaeology projects to receive more than Â£1m in funding from Historic Scotland for 2013/14.
The Wigtownshire dig was a small-scale pilot excavation of what was initially thought to be a crannog in the now-infilled Black Loch of Myrton, which was under threat of destruction as a result of drainage operations.
However during the excavation, AOC - which worked on the dig in conjunction with local volunteers - discovered evidence of multiple structures making up a small village.
What initially appeared to be one of a small group of mounds before excavation was revealed to be a massive stone hearth complex at the centre of a roundhouse.
The timber structure of the house has been preserved, with beams radiating out from the hearth forming the foundation, while the outer wall consists of a double-circuit of stakes.
The most surprising discovery was that the house was not built on top of an artificial foundation, but directly over the fen peat which had gradually filled in the loch.
Rather than being a single crannog, as first thought, it appears to be a settlement of at least seven houses built in the wetlands around the small loch.
This type of site is currently unique in Scotland and there are few other comparable sites elsewhere in the British Isles.
Similar lake villages - including Glastonbury and Meare, which is also in Somerset - have been found in England, but this is the first ""loch village"" to be uncovered in Scotland.
Experts hope that its discovery will help to improve knowledge and understanding of Iron Age Scotland.
Ms Hyslop welcomed the discovery.
""There are some excellent examples of 'lake villages' in England but this is the first time archaeologists have found a 'loch village' in Scotland,"" she said.
""I am pleased too that experts joined forces with local volunteers on this project and I look forward to discovering what more this important find can teach us about Iron Age Scotland.""","Archaeologists have discovered the remains of an Iron Age ""loch village"" in Wigtownshire, the first of its kind to be found in Scotland.",23896997
"Laurie Gerhardt, from Oxford, said he and other British nationals watched as other foreign tourists were airlifted to safety.
He claimed ""desperate"" telephone calls to the British embassy in Kathmandu were unanswered and the only advice from the UK was ""sit tight"".
The Foreign Office said its teams had been working around the clock in Nepal.
Mr Gerhardt was trekking in the Langtang National Park region when the earthquake struck.
He and friend Joe Butchers, also from Oxford, watched the lodge they were approaching ""crumble"" in front of them.
The pair, along with about a dozen other British people, camped on the mountain for six days waiting for help.
Talking to BBC Radio Oxford, Mr Gerhardt said the British government's response to the disaster was ""rubbish"".
""All other tourists managed to speak to their embassies and collaborate with insurance agencies to organise rescue helicopters to get them,"" the 24-year-old said.
But he said the British citizens ""got no response"".
Eventually his group made the decision to make the ""dangerous walk"" down the mountain to Kathmandu, four hours away.
They had to ""scramble"" over 20ft high (6m) landslides that blocked paths and roads.
He said: ""We had planned to stay put, but Nepali police and Army were quite dismissive about it and said no-one's coming for you.""
When the earthquake struck Mr Gerhardt feared ""the whole mountainside was going to break off and we were going to plunge to our deaths"".
He said: ""I was sitting there thinking it's very likely that I'm going to die. Now I'm just happy to be alive.""
When he eventually got through to the Foreign Office in the UK, the only advice he got was to ""stick tight"", he said.
A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said British teams had been working ""tirelessly"" to help British nationals, including arranging air lifts.

Mr Subramoney's journey to Manchester started in his small flat in the east of Johannesburg, South Africa's main city.
The flat is a shrine to Manchester United, and almost everything is red, from the crockery to the mugs to the key rings.
But it is one of the walls in the house that really stood out, his ""wall of fame"", which is covered with framed pictures of some of the special moments in Manchester United's history.
There are a couple of photographs of former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson hoisting the Premier League trophy.
Mr Subramoney's most treasured image is that showing Wayne Rooney mid-bicycle kick scoring the winning goal against Manchester City in 2011.
""This wall is very special to me. I am glad my wife allowed me to use this part of the house to do what I want.""
His passion began at 13 in 1994 when he saw Manchester United beat Chelsea 4-0 in the FA Cup final.
""I loved the way the team played and with that, I started my love journey,"" he said.
He saw that match on the television, but on Sunday he saw his dream team in the flesh.
""I have been saving for a year [from my salary as a warehouse manager] to make this trip happen,"" he said.
As for the cost of the trip, he admitted that the flights, the accommodation in London and Manchester, the stadium tour and the match set him back 24,000 rand ($2,000; Â£1,300).
But he said he cannot ""quantify [the value], it's priceless. For me that's money well spent,"" he said showing off his brand-new Manchester United kit.
""The only regret I have is that we didn't score a second goal to see off Arsenal today, it would have been nice to have a win but it's all fine.""

""The fortunate thing is that we were both Manchester United fans when we got married, so there was no indoctrination, it was just a match made in Old Trafford,"" Mr Bwanya said.
The trip was expensive but they felt it was worth the money, and they would do it again.
For many fans of the English Premier League in Africa, getting a UK visa is one of the obstacles that stands between them and getting to Old Trafford.
But Mr Subramoney had no such hassle.
""I belong to the official Manchester United supporters club in South Africa and they organised everything - I just had to pay my money and here I am in Manchester,"" he said.
Back at his home in Johannesburg, I asked his wife, Shivanie Subramoney, if she was not worried that the love for Manchester United might take over their marital bliss.
She simply said: ""I have since learnt how to love the team as well.""
She knows though that she is not allowed to wash her husband's Manchester United kits as most of them have been signed by Manchester United greats such as Paul Scholes, Brian Robson and Louis Saha.

"On Monday David Cameron did what every prime minister has done ahead of calling a general election: go to see the Queen.
After his trip to Buckingham Palace, he returned to Downing Street to formally announce the election, which will take place on 7 May.
From now on, politicians across the UK have got their work cut out.
For nearly six weeks, they'll be knocking on doors, debating with rivals and delivering speech after speech.
Once the campaigning stops, the people in power become powerless and voters decide who they want to run the country.
David Cameron has been prime minister for five years and wants you to give him five more.
Labour leader Ed Miliband hopes his time has come to move into 10 Downing Street.
This election is about much more than Conservatives v Labour though.
The UK is divided into 650 constituencies, with an MP elected in each area.
The magic number of MPs needed to win the election is 326 and so far it looks unlikely any party will reach that total this time around.
That means the smaller parties are likely to have a huge say in who governs the UK until 2020.
The Liberal Democrats have seen seen their support collapse over the past five years but hope they can convince past supporters that they deserve another chance based on their record as part of the coalition.
The rising popularity of the Scottish National Party could be one of the stories of the election.
Labour has traditionally been the biggest party in Scotland but that's under threat and could hurt their chances to win power.
UKIP could also have a big say on the outcome of this election.
Their leader, Nigel Farage, is hoping to become an MP and that his party manages to steal votes away from the other main parties.

"Sir Ivan, who was appointed to the role of permanent representative by David Cameron in 2013, had been expected to play a key role in Brexit talks expected to start within months.
The Foreign Office said it would not give reasons for his departure at the moment.
Last month the BBC revealed he had privately told ministers a UK-EU trade deal might take 10 years to finalise.
He told them this was also the view of the other 27 member states.
BBC Brussels correspondent Kevin Connolly said it appeared there had been ""some failure of synchronisation"" between Sir Ivan and the UK government.
Sir Ivan had been due to leave his post in November, the Financial Times reported.
Labour MP Hilary Benn, who chairs the Brexit select committee, said his resignation had come at a ""crucial"" point and urged the government to ""get its skates on"" in finding a replacement.
""It couldn't be a more difficult time to organise a handover,"" he added.

Sir Ivan is a veteran civil servant whose previous roles include private secretary to ex-chancellor Ken Clarke, principle private secretary to ex-PM Tony Blair and Mr Cameron's Europe adviser.

When it comes to ill-health, the royals and their advisers don't disseminate too much detail.
The head of state and her husband, they argue, are entitled to the same privacy as any other individual.
The heavy colds that delayed their departure from Buckingham Palace had clearly improved enough to allow the 90-year-old monarch and the 95-year-old duke to make the journey.

"Abid Naseer, who was extradited from the UK in 2013, is accused of plotting bomb attacks in Manchester and New York as part of an al Qaeda conspiracy.
He has pleaded not guilty and denied he was involved in any violent extremism.
A judge has made several rulings to protect the spies' identities, including modified court sketches.
Judge Raymond Dearie had previously approved the wigs and ""light"" make-up to protect the identifies of the officers and ordered courtroom sketch artists to further generalise their appearance over media organisation's objections.
Mr Naseer faces life in prison if convicted of the charges against him - providing and conspiring to provide material support to al Qaeda and conspiring to use a destructive device.
Prosecutors have called the testimony of the MI5 agents essential, saying they tracked Mr Naseer in 2009 and were the only witnesses to his alleged preparation to attack a Manchester shopping centre.
Inside the courtroom - Nick Bryant, BBC News
In a courthouse in Brooklyn, there was the sort of make-up and hair ordinarily associated with theatrical productions on Broadway.
The first MI5 agent who took the stand, known as Officer 1661, wore glasses, a jet-black wig and also a beard - though it was hard to tell whether the facial hair was real or artificial. Speaking in a northern English accent, he described how he had conducted surveillance in Liverpool and Manchester on the defendant Abid Naseer.
Others agents who took the stand included a female agent, Officer 1488, who wore glasses and a shoulder length brown wig, and a third agent, who looked to be of an Asian background, also wore glasses and a black wig.
Throughout the proceedings, they were watched by a representative of the British government, who himself wore a wig and glasses. He also scrutinised the drawings of court artists, who had been instructed by the judge to depict blank faces and generic hair.
The agents followed him as he visited a shopping centre in Manchester, allegedly the target of the plot, a mosque and other locations.
He was previously arrested in the UK on suspicion of plotting an attack.
No explosives were found but he and others were ordered to leave the country. Mr Naseer avoided deportation to Pakistan.
US prosecutors have argued Mr Naseer was the leader of an al-Qaeda cell in Manchester and involved in planning bomb plots in multiple countries, including an alleged plan to bomb the New York city subway.
Mr Naseer is representing himself and has said he went online and used email to find a wife, not contact an al-Qaeda handler, as prosecutors have alleged.
But one officer told the court he had never seen Mr Naseer in the company of a woman.
On Tuesday, Mr Naseer had the opportunity to cross-examine the intelligence officer who had tracked him in the UK.
""Did these movements cause any alarm or suspicion?"" he asked. ""No,"" the man, known as Officer 1661, replied.
Evidence from another MI5 spy was recorded last month and played in court in Brooklyn last week.
The officer said he followed Abid Naseer onto a coach and observed him watching a video of the 9/11 attacks on his mobile phone.
UK officials arrested him at the request of US prosecutors several years ago. He was eventually deported after losing an appeal at the European Court of Human Rights.","MI5 agents, wearing wigs and make-up to hide their identities, have told a US jury how they tracked a man accused of a transatlantic bomb plot.",31609165

"It represents rank and file officers and said many are reluctant to become firearms specialists, subjected to long investigations after a fatal shooting.
In the wake of the Paris attacks Met Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said there would be 600 more firearms officers to protect London.
The Met has 100 new officers to date.
About 1,000 applicants have applied to be trained in the use of firearms and a force spokesman said it was ""more than satisfied not only with the quantity of the applications, but also with the quality.""
However, the national lead for armed policing, deputy chief constable Simon Chesterman, said he only expected to get about half of the suitable applicants through the rigorous training process, which hampered speedy recruitment.
He added: ""I think the greatest threat to delivering the uplift [extra officers] is officers' fears about what they will face in the event they have to discharge a firearm and they are really concerned about what will happen to them post incident.""
Retired Met Police officer Anthony Long was cleared in 2015 of the unlawful killing of suspected armed robber Azelle Rodney whom he shot dead in 2005.
Mr Long said: ""I am the worst case scenario.
""Non-firearms officers, who might be considering a position as a firearms officer, are rightly saying to themselves, why would I put myself and my family through that, what is the gain, because you don't get paid any more for being a firearms officer?""
Home Office figures show the total number of armed officers has fallen in the Met Police by about 717 people since March 2010 when there were 2,856 firearms officers compared to 2,139 in March 2016.
The reduction was largely due to cuts in police budgets, the Met Police Federation said.
Federation chairman Ken Marsh said: ""We really are struggling to recruit.
""I think at the moment the commissioner said [he wanted] 600, we are not even halfway there yet.
""I think the next batch is going to be far harder because there is only a certain pool that you are taking these officers from.""
The increase in firearms officers for the capital was part of a national plan to increase the UK's armed response teams, mainly funded by the government. The officers were due to be deployed within two years of the announcement in April.
Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) deputy chair Sarah Green said ""We recognise the challenging and dangerous circumstances in which firearms officers operate but it is right that when there is a fatality there is an independent investigation. Our independent scrutiny should not cause any officer to be concerned about taking on a firearms role.""
In the past six years the IPCC has completed 23 investigations into the use of police firearms, of which seven cases involved fatalities.
It said in 21 of those cases, including six fatal shootings, no firearms officer involved ""was at any time treated as a suspect by the IPCC"".
""We are working hard to reduce the amount of time our work takes but many firearms investigations involving a fatality are complex and the public rightly have an expectation of thorough scrutiny,"" Ms Green added.","The Metropolitan Police Service could struggle to recruit 600 extra firearms officers within two years, the Met Police Federation has warned.",37762369

"The University of Aberdeen team said the findings were especially true of couples without a shared social circle.
They compensate by ""adopting"" the on-screen social groups - such as in Game of Thrones - as their own.
The researchers said the more frequently couples watched box sets or films together, the more highly they rated their relationship commitment.
The research measured the extent to which people shared programme viewing with their partners, whether they had a lot of friends in common and how they rated their relationship.
The university said the results showed that when people did not share many friends with their partner, sharing media strongly predicted greater relationship quality.
Dr Sarah Gomillion, who led the study, said: ""Relationships are a very big contributor to our physical and psychological health.
""So understanding how relationships can be better and how you can improve relationships can also improve our physical and psychological health.
""What these results suggest to us is that when people have a hole in their social network that they share with their partners they might become more motivated to share media as a way to compensate for that deficit.
""Watching TV with a partner or watching a movie you both like is a really easy way to improve relationship quality and anyone can do it at any time so if this is something that is good for relationships, it might help us identify an intervention that can improve relationship quality.""

"In a new campaign, Public Health England says too many smokers remain unaware of the risks of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
COPD, which narrows the airways, can leave people struggling to do simple tasks such as climbing stairs.
Figures show more than 1m people in England are living with it, with nine in 10 cases caused by smoking.
COPD is actually the umbrella term for a number of serious lung conditions including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
People with the disease have difficulties breathing, primarily due to the narrowing of their airways and destruction of lung tissue.
Typical symptoms include breathlessness when active, a persistent cough and frequent chest infections.
But in the Public Health England (PHE) campaign, experts say smokers often dismiss the early signs as a ""smoker's cough"" but, by continuing to smoke, the condition can get worse and damage their quality of life.
While there is no cure, stopping smoking, tailored exercise programmes and medication can slow the progression of COPD.
To raise awareness about the disease, PHE's short film will run on the internet.
It features former Olympic athlete Iwan Thomas, whose mother was recently diagnosed with COPD, doing an experiment with smokers to see what COPD is like.
Mr Thomas said: ""I've never fully understood COPD or the everyday consequences, but when the simple things like climbing the stairs, making a cup of tea or walking to the bus stop become impossible, it is serious.
""After years of smoking, it is great that my mum is making 2016 the year she quits and I'd urge anyone who smokes to do the same.""
Prof Dame Sally Davies, England's chief medical officer, added: ""COPD is a serious lung disease and is not particularly well known.
""The single best thing a smoker can do to reduce their chances of developing this devastating disease and prolong their life is to stop smoking.""",Smokers are being urged not to dismiss the early signs of a debilitating disease as simply a smoker's cough.,35171626

If she did come to the WSL, she would certainly pose a goal threat, having scored 92 times in 95 games for Brazil.
Marta, who currently plays for Swedish side Rosengard, was speaking after they lost 3-1 against Manchester City in a pre-season friendly.
She did not feature in the match because of a hamstring problem but says she was impressed with the WSL 1 side's performance.
""City surprised me because they have a very strong team,"" she told BBC Sport. ""There was a lot of high pressure and they did very well.

"The hosts took nine wickets in an extraordinary session after tea to bowl India out for 161 and win the fourth Test by an innings and 54 runs.
For the second match in a row, spinner Moeen Ali was instrumental in the final push, taking 4-39 as England made light of the absence of the injured Stuart Broad, whose nose was broken by a Varun Aaron bouncer at the end of England's first innings.
James Anderson claimed 2-18 and Chris Jordan took the final two wickets in two balls to the delight of a full house at a sun-drenched ground.
The hosts had earlier posted 367 all out, with Joe Root's 77 and Jos Buttler's 70 giving them a lead of 215 runs, with 61 overs left in the day to bowl out India before Sunday's predicted downpours.
In the end they needed only 43, completing an extraordinary turnaround by a team that was heavily beaten in the second Test at Lord's to extend their winless run to 10 Tests.
Even more remarkable is the transformation of Moeen, who took only 10 wickets at an average of 45 in his first four Tests this summer, but now has 12 victims at 14 in his last two.
England will hope to carry their winning momentum into the final Test at The Oval, starting on Friday, where only an India victory can deny them the series.
Chris Woakes, taking the new ball in Broad's absence, got the breakthrough for England with a delivery that nipped back slightly and rapped Murali Vijay's pads in front of leg stump.
But the real havoc was wrought after tea in a breathless period in which five wickets fell for 13 runs in 29 balls.
Gautam Gambhir nicked Anderson down the leg side for 18 and, from the first ball of the next over, Cheteshwar Pujara was given out lbw to Moeen, although TV replays - unavailable to umpires in this series with India refusing to use the Decision Review System - suggested the ball was missing leg stump.
Ajinkya Rahane was superbly caught by Moeen off his own bowling and Anderson continued his hold over Virat Kohli by having the India batsman taken at second slip by Ian Bell.
In the 30 balls he has faced from Anderson in the series, Kohli has scored seven runs and been out four times.
Ravindra Jadeja was out for four in Moeen's next over as he pushed forward and edged to Jordan at slip, Mahendra Dhoni's counter-attacking 27 was ended when he dragged Moeen to Gary Ballance at mid-wicket and Bhuvneshwar Kumar was run out attempting a suicidal second run.
Roaring in from the Brian Statham End with the crowd cheering him on, Jordan then had Varun Aaron caught behind off a short ball and Pankaj Singh bowled off his toes before wheeling away in celebration with his jubilant team-mates in pursuit.

Pankaj had earlier ended his wait for a maiden Test wicket in his 70th over, but only after England had pushed their lead beyond 150 runs.
As the heavy rain that prevented any play after 14:15 BST on Friday gave way to bright sunshine, Root and Buttler played positively in a partnership of 134.
Buttler mixed good fortune - he was dropped by Kohli in the gully on 34 and badly missed by Dhoni when he should have been run out for 44 - with fine strokeplay to record successive fifties in his first two Test innings.
Root was more cautious as he reached fifty off 103 balls, only to be denied a third Test century of the summer by Pankaj's unlikely intervention.
The Yorkshire batsman could not resist dabbling at a ball down the leg side and walked away cursing himself after the delivery flicked his gloves and was taken by Dhoni.
Having waited 69.2 overs to take his first Test wicket, Pankaj only had to wait two more for his next. Buttler, driving on the up, spooned a slower ball straight to Pujara at mid-off.
The runs continued to flow as Woakes cracked a fluent unbeaten 26 and Broad - the man of the match following his destructive bowling in the first innings - twice cleared the ropes before trying to repeat the shot and top-edging the ball between his helmet and his grille.
He received treatment to his gaping nose wound on the field and was later taken to hospital for X-rays, where the break was confirmed.

"About 700 Welsh employers will be affected when the UK-wide levy is introduced on 6 April.
An assembly committee said Welsh Government engagement about the charge had been ""patchy"" and employers were confused.
The Welsh Government said it was helping to ""minimise"" its impact.
All employers with a wage bill of more than Â£3m a year will pay a 0.5% levy towards the apprenticeship scheme in England.
The UK government has said Wales will get around Â£130m a year from its share of the levy, but Welsh Ministers have disputed this.
A report published by the assembly's Economy Committee on Wednesday said the tax had ""considerable implications"" for devolved areas and had been introduced without the assembly being consulted.
Committee chairman Russell George said businesses still had concerns about the introduction of the levy next week and ministers ""must re-double efforts"" to clear things up.
""While the Welsh Government published detailed new documentation immediately prior to giving evidence to the Committee, engagement with employers over the last year has been patchy and employers still have questions about what they'll get for their money,"" he said.
The Conservative AM repeated calls for the UK government to ask the assembly's permission before imposing charges devolved in Wales.
The report makes 13 recommendations to the Welsh Government, including lobbying the UK government to make sure schools are not adversely affected by the change.
The Welsh Government has pledged to create at least 100,000 high quality all-age apprenticeships over the next five years.
A spokesman said the apprenticeship levy ""directly conflicts with areas of devolved responsibility"" and overlooked its own approach in Wales.
""To help minimise its impact on employers and learners the Welsh Government is taking a different approach to its counterparts in England - one which is better aligned to and supports the growing needs, of Wales, its people and economy,"" he said.

The ex-Tory leader said he was an ""outright Eurosceptic"" but suggested staying in was ""the lesser of evils"".
Vote Leave said its proposals would reduce immigration and accused the Remain campaign of ""scaremongering"".

Lord Hague also said Turkish accession to the EU should not be the key factor in making people's minds up, because it is ""not on the cards"", and warned of a ""danger of the fragmentation of the Western world"" if the UK leaves.
Leave campaigners have highlighted the government's backing for Turkish membership of the EU, saying a million Turks could potentially come to the UK within eight years of joining.

Lord Hague, who as Tory leader fought the 2001 election campaign on a platform of keeping the UK out of the euro, will argue his four years as foreign secretary has not sapped his Euroscepticism or his opposition to the UK's involvement in monetary union or a European army.
This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.
But he will argue that EU membership confers clear economic and diplomatic benefits on the UK.

"Cy Sullivan, 26, raped his 42-year-old victim on 27 November 2009.
DNA was recovered but there was no match in the national database.
But a routine swab was taken when he was charged with assaulting a bouncer in October 2015 and it matched the DNA found at Greyfriars Churchyard.
Sullivan, from Shetland, claimed he and his victim had consensual sex, but a jury convicted him of raping her while she was so intoxicated she could not have given consent.
He was jailed for five years.
At the High Court in Glasgow judge Lady Rae told Sullivan: ""You raped a lady almost twice your age. You took advantage of her intoxicated state.
""She has been left seriously traumatised by what you did and with having to relive what she remembered, and the shame and embarrassment she felt when she was discovered by police in the state of undress that you left her in. She was a stranger to you.""
The court heard that the victim was found by police wandering half naked in the cemetery in a confused and drunken state.
She described what happened to her as ""a living nightmare.""
In evidence, she said she had travelled from her home in the Highlands to attend a conference in Edinburgh and decided to visit the grave of Greyfriars Bobby.
The woman said she had drunk at least eight glasses of wine. A police officer who saw her hours later at 05:00 described her as 'intoxicated.""
The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was asked by prosecutor Ian Wallace: ""Do you remember leaving Greyfriars pub,"" and she said: ""No. I remember coming round in the graveyard and there was a police lady.
""I was frozen and I was disorientated. I tried for some time to find my way out.
""It was like something happened and I had just come round. It was awful. I just felt awful, embarrassed. I had no clothing on my bottom half.""
The woman told the jurors that she had no memory of what happened after she left the pub until the police found her.
She was asked if she had any recollection of anyone having sex with her and replied: ""No.""
Mr Wallace then said: ""Did you want to have sex with anyone that night,"" and the victim said: ""Definitely not.""
Sullivan told the court he had bought the woman a drink and then afterwards had sex with her. He claimed that she appeared fine to him and not drunk.
Sullivan was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in May this year and was taken into court in a wheelchair before walking a few feet to the dock using crutches.
His defence counsel David Nicolson said: ""His family maintain their support of him, particularly his partner of three years.

"The Stem Cup, which dates back to about 1425, was the most valuable of more than 250 items bequeathed to the university by Ernest Thornhill in 1944.
The value of the artefacts means the university cannot afford to securely exhibit the collection, and the money raised by selling the cup will go towards building a new display centre.
It is due to be auctioned next year.
Deputy vice-chancellor of the university, Rosy Crehan, said: ""It is clear from the bequest that Ernest Thornhill intended his collection to be used as a study resource.
""We envisage that proceeds from the sale of the Stem Cup will enable us to comply with the original bequest and give our students full and proper access to this historically significant collection of oriental ceramics - some of which are dated to be over 3,000 years old.""

"Mr Cook's salary rose to $2m (Â£1.3m) from $1.4m, and his total remuneration more than doubled to $9.2m in 2014.
The base salaries for other executives were also increased by over 14% to $1m, the company said in its annual report.
Apple's New York-listed shares had hit a record high last year, while almost 40m iPhones were sold.
The increase to Mr Cook's salary was the first since November 2011. He became chief executive in August that year following the death of Steve Jobs.
In the report, Apple said the increases were given after reviewing data provided by its independent compensation consultant about the arrangements of its competitors.
The executive team's bonuses were also increased to a maximum of 400% of the member's salary.
In November, Apple was worth more than $700bn after its stock hit a record high of $119.75. The stock was trading at $112.29 in New York on Friday, valuing the company at $658bn.
Angela Ahrendts, the former Burberry chief executive who joined Apple last year in the newly created role of senior vice-president, retail and online stores, was awarded a bumper package worth just over $73m (Â£48.6m).
The total included share options worth $37m to compensate for those she lost by leaving Burberry, along with $33m given as a ""golden hello"".
Ahrendts' base salary was $1m, and she was also paid a $1.6m cash bonus and a hiring bonus of $500,000.
Total compensation for Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, topped $14m - also exceeding Mr Cook by a substantial margin.
However, Mr Cook was awarded a pay package worth $378m when he took the top job - mostly comprised of share options that he will receive in 2016 and 2021.
Meanwhile, Apple said that Millard ""Mickey"" Drexler, who has been a director on its board since 1999, will step down in March.

"Jamie Vardy opened the scoring for Leicester from close range after Ritchie De Laet's cross.
Matt Kilgallon headed in an equaliser before the break for his first goal in Blackburn colours.
Leicester's last win at Ewood Park in all competitions came in the Premier League in May 1997. Blackburn have won five of the last seven home meetings against the Foxes, drawing the other two.
Leicester are 15 points clear of third-placed Derby County.
The Foxes went into the match seven points clear at the top of the table, with a game in hand, and are now unbeaten in 17 Championship games, winning 13 of them.
They boast the best away record in the division, with 11 wins from 18, while Blackburn had lost their last two home matches to lose pace with the play-off chasing pack.
Burnley's win at Charlton moves them to just five points off the leaders but Leicester are still 15 points ahead of third-placed Derby as they look to secure promotion to the Premier League.
The Foxes looked like continuing their good form on their travels as Vardy tapped in an opener from close-range, following De Laet's cross.
Jordan Rhodes was denied an instant leveller by Kasper Schmeichel's one-handed save, before the striker had a penalty appeal turned down following a challenge by De Laet.
The equaliser did come just before half-time though when Kilgallon met Craig Conway's corner to head home.
Blackburn almost took the lead soon after the restart but Rudy Gestede's goal-bound header was blocked on the line by Rhodes, before Vardy hit a post for Leicester after rounding goalkeeper Paul Robinson.
Blackburn manager Gary Bowyer:
""I thought we were excellent. They're a top team with a top manager and we've gone toe-to-toe and had a right good go.
""It's certainly one of the better performances this season.
""There haven't been too many performances where we haven't competed, but against the league leaders we've got to be pleased with that. But we can't rest on our laurels now.""
Leicester assistant manager Craig Shakespeare:
""I think we had the best clear-cut chances in the game but I think if we'd taken all three [points], with Blackburn's performance, they'd have been disappointed not to take something out of it.
""They gave us as good a game as we've had all season. At the start of the second half they were on top but we probably shaded it in terms of the best chances.

"Speaking on his Radio 2 breakfast show earlier, he said he had texted Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May before the announcement was made.
Hammond, he said, had wished him good luck and gave assurances he ""didn't blame him"" for taking the job.
Evans also said there will ""absolutely"" be a woman in the new Top Gear line-up.
But he said he would not have a female co-presenter just ""for the sake of it"".
""I want to have people who are extremely knowledgeable about cars... people who have great energy, good timing... who are keen to do things differently,"" he told Radio 5 live.
The BBC has yet to confirm the rest of the Top Gear line-up - but Formula 1 presenter Suzi Perry featured prominently in the audience of Evans' TV show TFI Friday last week.
In his first remarks about the Top Gear job, broadcast on Radio 2 at 08:15 BST, Evans said Clarkson had also wished him ""the best of luck"".
Clarkson ""then gave me a piece of advice which I'm not going to repeat on the radio"", the broadcaster told his listeners.
Clarkson's contract was not renewed by the BBC after he punched a Top Gear producer in March.
Evans, a noted car enthusiast, had previously ruled himself out of becoming taking over the show.
Evans said he had wanted Top Gear to carry on with Hammond and May and had not wanted to ""contaminate the situation"" by throwing his hat in the ring.
""Whenever I said 'I categorically rule myself out of running for office', it was because I didn't want to be a pawn in a chess game involving three of my friends.""
The situation changed this week, he explained, with Hammond and May confirming they would not continue on the programme in Clarkson's absence.
This led to a conversation with Mark Linsey, the BBC's controller of entertainment commissioning, and an offer he felt he had to accept.
Top Gear, said Evans, was ""the biggest television show in the world"" and his ""favourite television show of all time"".
""I love producing TV... and so I said yes,"" continued the former TFI Friday host, who will lead an as yet unconfirmed line-up of new presenters.
Hammond, Evans went on, had told him he was ""designed and built"" for the Top Gear job and that his hiring was ""always the BBC's very best option"".
Evans also hinted obliquely that James May may play some role on the programme in future.
""We're going to meet up today and tomorrow and talk about things and who knows what might happen there.""
Evans has signed a three-year deal to host and produce the BBC Two show, one of the corporation's most popular international exports.
It is watched by 350 million viewers worldwide, with overseas sales worth an estimated Â£50m a year.
Evans has also received the backing of Chris Goffey, who co-hosted Top Gear in the 1980s and 1990s.
The broadcaster, Goffey told BBC Breakfast, was ""the obvious choice"", asking: ""Who else in TV is really clued-up about the cars and has got a persona to match Jeremy's?""
Speaking to Radio 5 live on Wednesday, Evans said he had started formulating ideas for the show on Saturday, adding they involved ""evolution, not revolution"".
""The films have got to stay there,"" he said of the elaborate film sequences that were a feature of the Clarkson era. ""They're a crucial part of what Top Gear is.
""We'll look at what we have to put in, what we need to put in, and then we'll see what we might want to put in,"" he continued.
""The first thing I'm going to do is sit down [with the Top Gear production team] and say, 'tell me what you know.'""
In addition to confirming ""100 percent"" that a woman would feature on the new presenting line-up, Evans said the popular Star in a Reasonably Priced Car segment would remain a Top Gear staple.
But he said it would change and that ""bells and whistles"" would be added.
Top Gear, he went on, was ""a fantastic programme"" that was ""so rock solid"" and had ""always been brilliant"".
""I've never seen a bad Top Gear,"" he told Nicky Campbell. ""They don't exist.""
Evans also reiterated his earlier stated intention that he hoped to remain as host of Radio 2's breakfast show.","Chris Evans has revealed he has received the blessing of Top Gear's former hosts, after it was announced he would be taking over the BBC show.",33162666
"Schmidt opted to select Jackson, 24, as opposed to Ian Madigan, to replace injured Johnny Sexton in Saturday's first Test in Cape Town.
""Paddy did some super stuff,"" said the Ireland coach after the 26-20 win.
""He controlled the first 20 minutes of the game. We actually built our confidence through that period.""
Ireland clinched their historic victory despite having South African-born flanker CJ Stander red-carded in the first half after he knocked Springboks fly-half Patrick Lambie unconscious following a flying charge-down attempt.
The impressive Jared Payne's touchdown helped Ireland take an early 10-3 lead and while Jackson did gift Pieter-Steph du Toit an intercept try, Jackson's late penalty sealed the visitors' triumph.
Schmidt felt Stander's dismissal was ""very, very harsh"" but French referee Mathieu Raynal's decision will mean Irish rugby fans will look upon Saturday's result as one of the best in the country's history.
""It's pretty hard to put into words really. I thought it was an incredible collective effort,"" added the Ireland coach.
""The nine minutes before half-time when we were down to 13 players, to just put them out in the corner, just to scramble and work as hard as the players did to keep them out.
""For the players, I think they can be incredibly proud of the effort they put in.""
Captain Rory Best made no attempt to downplay the significance of the win.
""What a way to make history, by having to do something special,"" said the Irish skipper, 33.
""For us, it was about the way we stood up.
""It was really tough. You can see why no Irish team has ever won here before, so to win with a man down took a lot of character. It is a very special day for us.""
Man of the match Devin Toner praised new defence coach Andy Farrell's input into Ireland's stunning victory.
""He has added a new dimension,"" Toner said.
""We're getting off the line, we're trying to put hits in and thankfully it came off today.
New South Africa coach Allister Coetzee said his team had been ""poor"" and must improve for the remaining Tests in the series over the next two weekends.
""It is a disappointing performance and a result,"" said Coetzee.
""It is hurting, it's not an ideal start but as a collective we take responsibility for that.

"The extra day off - Japan now has 16 public holidays a year - became law in 2014 but is just taking effect.
The campaign to have a Mountain Day was a longstanding cause for hiking and mountain-related groups, who wanted to celebrate Japan's terrain and its connection to the nation's geography and culture.
Japan also likes to have something specific to celebrate on each public holiday, such as Greenery Day in May, Marine Day in July and Respect for the Aged Day in September, though most people treat them as just another day off.
Because the kanji (Chinese characters used in written Japanese) for ""eight"", å…«, looks a bit like the sides of a mountain.
Also ""11"" looks a bit like two trees, say some. Many municipalities had also already designated the date as one to celebrate mountains and, unusually, there were no other public holidays in August.
Japan's dramatic landscapes is scattered with volcanoes, earthquakes and hot springs, caused by the smashing of tectonic plates.
The country's many peaks are more than just geographical features. They also explain Japan's densely packed cities - squeezed into the flat land near the sea, and, observers say, the culture that has arisen there.
Despite this extreme urbanisation, many Japanese people see themselves as more in touch with nature than people in many other developed nations.
Not exactly. While hill-walking is popular, especially with senior citizens, an admittedly small survey by the Japan Weather Association found that nearly a third of those they asked had not even heard of the new holiday.
Nearly 10% were thinking about a trip to the mountains though - not such a bad idea in the notorious heat of the cities in August. Those that do have been advised to go properly equipped and keep an eye on weather forecasts.
Japan now has more official days off than any other member of the Group of Eight (G8) world powers. It also has a problem with people working excessive hours and not claiming all the leave they are owed, which has been blamed for weak consumer demand - and even for Japan's low birth rate.
It is hoped public holidays encourage people to take longer vacations - you only need to take a few days off to join them with weekends to get a proper break - and spend money in the process.
The Japan Times suggests the new holiday will be responsible for a possible extra 820bn yen ($8bn; Â£6bn) in spending, including a jump in sales of camping gear.
Any effect on the birth rate is less clear, though families are probably grateful for more time together.","Japan is marking Mountain Day on Thursday, the latest addition to its extensive public holiday calendar.",37030868
"Rival Boeing says it could pave the way for the US to seek up to $10bn (Â£8bn) in annual retaliatory tariffs.
It follows years of accusations between the two aerospace giants that each received state funding.
The WTO is yet to rule on a similar EU complaint that Boeing benefits from billions of dollars in tax breaks.
Washington responded to the ruling by calling for an immediate halt for EU subsidies to support US jobs.
Meanwhile Airbus said it would appeal the judgment and the EU said it found some of the findings ""unsatisfactory"".
Analysis: Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent
There are two suppliers of large civil aircraft: Boeing in the US and Airbus in Europe.
The EU and the US have both taken complaints to the WTO about subsidies supplied by the other.
At the smaller end of the market segment there are other suppliers, and certainly the potential for more from China and Russia, for example, in the future - which could well involve state subsidies that eventually end up in front of a WTO dispute settlement panel.
For now, though the big stuff is a duopoly. There are two players with state backing, according to WTO judgements. For the rest of the world that is pretty good news.
It ensures there is at least some competition. And without the subsidies, a large plane could well be even more expensive.
It is the latest of a series of tit-for-tat transatlantic complaints about aircraft subsidies that make up the world's largest and longest-running trade dispute, which has so far been bitterly battled out over 12 years.
In June 2011, the WTO found that the EU and four of its member countries provided billions of dollars in subsidised financing to Airbus.
While the EU subsequently claimed to have come into compliance, the US disagreed and requested that a compliance panel intervene.
The compliance panel has now ruled that the EU failed to comply with all but two of 36 earlier rulings to cut back subsidies European governments provided to Airbus.
The loans were a ""genuine and substantial"" cause of significant lost sales for Boeing, the WTO said.
The EU had argued that the most recent Airbus jet, the A350, fell outside the case, but that was rejected by the WTO which said funding for the jet had been subsidised.
However it rejected US claims that it fell into the most serious category of ""prohibited"" aid.
The WTO has also issued rulings over the years saying that Boeing was the recipient of banned federal and state support.
Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing chairman, said: ""Today's ruling finally holds the EU and Airbus to account for their flouting of global trade rules.""
""This long-awaited decision is a victory for fair trade worldwide and for US aerospace workers, in particular.""
US Trade Representative Michael Froman said the panel's finding was ""a sweeping victory for the United States and its aerospace workers"".
He called on the EU, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Spain ""to respect WTO rules"".
""We call on them to end subsidised financing of Airbus immediately,'' he said.
In response, the EU said: ""There are certain findings of the panel that we consider to be unsatisfactory. We are closely analysing the report.""
It said the findings should be read in the context of two other reports expected to address US subsidies in coming months.
Airbus said it mostly conformed with its global trade commitments and would appeal.
""We only needed to make limited changes in European policies and practices to comply,"" it said in a statement.
""We will address the few still remaining points indicated by the report in our appeal,"" Airbus said.
Both the EU and the United States have the right to appeal against the ruling.","The EU has failed to comply with rulings that it should cut subsidies to aircraft maker Airbus, the World Trade Organisation has ruled.",37444780

"Brominated vegetable oil, or BVO, is found in Coca-Cola fruit and sports drinks such as Fanta and Powerade.
Rival Pepsi removed the chemical from its Gatorade sports drink last year.
In Japan and the European Union, the use of BVO as a food additive is not allowed.
Pepsi has a plan to remove the ingredient from its entire product portfolio.
It uses BVO in its Mountain Dew and Amp Energy drinks sold in the US.
BVO has been used as a stabiliser in fruit-flavoured drinks as it helps to prevent ingredients from separating.
According to medical researchers at the Mayo Clinic, excessive consumption of soft drinks containing BVO has been linked to negative health effects, including reports of memory loss and skin and nerve problems.
BVO was dropped from the US Food and Drug Administration's ""Generally Recognised as Safe"" list of food ingredients in 1970.
However, drinks companies in the US are allowed to use BVO at up to 15 parts per million.
Coca-Cola spokesman Josh Gold stressed the move to remove BVO was not an issue of safety.
""All of our beverages, including those with BVO, are safe and always have been - and comply with all regulations in the countries where they are sold,"" he said in a statement.
""The safety and quality of our products is our highest priority.""
Coca-Cola said it would switch to using sucrose acetate isobutyrate or glycerol ester of rosin, which is commonly found in chewing gum.
The Atlanta-based company said two flavours of its Powerade sports drink - fruit punch and strawberry lemonade - have already replaced BVO with glycerol ester of rosin.
Coca-Cola said that BVO was not used in many nations other than the US, but it would be removed from products in Canada and Latin America.
Coca-Cola's decision to remove BVO from its drink reflects a growing move among companies to reconsider certain practices due to public pressure.
The campaign against the use of BVO was begun by Sarah Kavanagh, a teenager from Mississippi, who questioned why the ingredient was being used in drinks targeted at health-conscious athletes.
Thousands of people have since signed her online petition on Change.org to have BVO removed from drinks.
Following Monday's announcement by Coca-Cola and Pepsi, Ms Kavanagh was quoted as saying: ""It's really good to know that companies, especially big companies, are listening to consumers.''","The world's largest beverage-maker, Coca-Cola, plans to remove a controversial ingredient from some of its US drinks brands by the end of this year, following an online petition.",27289259
"Earlier reports said a decision to call for removal had already been made.
There are concerns that the implants supplied by Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) carry potential health risks, according to the newspaper, Liberation.
PIP was found last year to have used a non-authorised silicone gel that caused abnormally high implant rupture rates.
The French government has formed a special committee to look at the issue.
""We have to remove all these implants,"" Dr Laurent Lantieri, a plastic surgeon on the committee, told Liberation. ""We're facing a health crisis, linked to a fraud.""
Government spokeswoman Valerie Pecresse told French television that a plan of action would be unveiled later this week.
""All women who have PIP implants should return to see their surgeons urgently,"" she added. But a health ministry official said there was no immediate health risk.
Investigations by the French Society of Plastic Surgeons last year found that PIP implants had a higher rate of rupture than other implants and that the silicone in them was not meant for medical use.
PIP went into administration last year and the use of its implants was banned.
Police have received 2,000 complaints from women who received the implants and have opened a criminal investigation into the firm, the AFP news agency reports.
Since the defects were discovered, 523 implants have been removed, according to the Le Monde newspaper.
Eight cases of cancer had so far been reported in patients with PIP implants, France's Director General for Health, Jean-Yves Grall, told Liberation. A ninth patient in Gers died of cancer last year.
But the head of France's National Cancer Institute, Dominique Maraninchi, said last week the cases were not necessarily linked to faulty implants.
Mr Grall added that all costs related to the removal of the implants would be reimbursed, although it is not clear if this will extend to paying for replacement implants.
PIP implants were among the cheapest available, and were also exported outside France. It is thought that as many as 40,000 British women may have them.","French authorities say they will decide this week whether to ask 30,000 women given a potentially defective type of breast implant to have them removed.",16264974
"Shaun Whiter and friend Joey Abbs were struck by the car as they changed a tyre near Newmarket on 1 July 2016.
Mr Whiter had to have both legs amputated and Mr Abbs was seriously hurt.
Mr Whiter says he still wants his legs back but is determined to ""focus on the positives"" like marrying Charlotte Way.
Before the accident, he was playing for Newmarket Town FC and Mr Abbs was in the Soham squad.
Within days of his operation however Mr Whiter, 28, had vowed to ""walk down the aisle"" with Ms Way.
He took his life-changing injuries well on the face of it, throwing himself into rehabilitation, and expressing hopes to take part in the 2020 Paralympics.
But losing both legs beneath the knee is not plain sailing and ""I cry a lot"", he said.
He had gone out that night specifically to help Mr Abbs change the flat tyre on his car when they were both struck by the vehicle.
The driver, Jan Adamec, 40, from Haverhill, failed to stop at the scene and ""left us there to die"" Mr Abbs, now 32, said.
Seriously injured himself, he recalls hobbling to his friend and holding his hand as they waited for paramedics.
""It was obviously bad. The pool of blood on the floor was unbelievable,"" he said.
""Shaun said, 'How can he just leave us here?'""
A year on, Mr Whiter is looking to the future.
""The dream would be to have children,"" he said.
He wants to be able to ""walk to the park"" and, despite facing two more years' rehabilitation, still has sporting ambitions.
""I would like to have a crack... but the main thing is to get married, have a family, and then see where it goes from there,"" he said.
Ms Way has ""been there every single day"", he said.
""Visually, people can see what's going on - they can see the legs - but Charlotte is there mentally, by my side,"" he added.
There is ""bitterness"", he admits, but ""it's over and done with - you've got to move on"".
Mr Abbs is back in training but the mental scars remain, and he has had time off work and is on medication.
""Even though I know it wasn't my fault I still feel that if I hadn't called Shaun, he wouldn't be in this position,"" he said.
However, Mr Whiter said he is determined to see the ""positives"".
""I do wake up some days and wish I could get up normally, but now I have to... put these [prosthetic] legs on.
""But, I've had amazing opportunities that would never have happened had that not happened.
""I'm the first to admit I want my legs back... but I've got to deal with it.""
During the past year he has taken part in charity events, raising money for the air ambulance.
""For now, I'm going to take every challenge and every day and see where it goes,"" he said.

"Jennifer Burns, from Gauldry in Fife, took £950 from the bank account of 91-year-old Dr Alexina McWhinnie.
Dr McWhinnie was a renowned social researcher in assisted conception at Dundee University until her retirement.
At Dundee Sheriff Court, Burns admitted two charges of theft between 15 November and 14 December last year and will be sentenced next month.
Burns targeted Dr McWhinnie - who received an MBE from Prince Charles for her work - after she gave Burns her bank card and PIN number to withdraw cash on her behalf.
Dr McWhinnie told the court: ""If you can't trust the people who look after you, then who can you trust?""
Fiscal depute John Adams told the court: ""The complainer is a 91-year-old female whose family employs care services to assist her.
""On December 19 her son came to stay with her in the run up to Christmas and was checking her bank records when he realised something had gone awry. They reconciled this with information from the care firm and it was realised the accused had been the person there on the relevant dates.""
Defence solicitor Scott Norrie said: ""She (Burns) had accumulated a debt of £2,000 during a previous relationship that subsequently broke down.
""She had a reasonable relationship with the complainer and they got on well. She saw the opportunity to clear some of those debts and abused the trust of this lady.
""She lost her job as a result - but living with her parents continued to put up the pretence of having a job, leaving for work each morning and coming back at night. She is utterly ashamed of her actions.""
Dr McWhinnie said she was ""foolish"" to give her bank card and PIN to Burns.
She said: ""I foolishly asked her on one occasion if she would mind going to the cash machine for me as I struggle to get down there. I didn't realise straight away but somehow she must have been able to use my card over the next month.""
Dr McWhinnie said she contacted police after she noticed a large sum of money was missing from her account.
She added: ""She took advantage of my trust and it left me shattered. I felt as if I'd been cheated and it made me realise how vulnerable I am.""","A carer has admitted stealing nearly £1,000 from a retired doctor she was supposed to be looking after.",32898158
"Bridgend's Madeleine Moon, who sits on the House of Commons Defence Committee, told BBC Wales there were not enough pilots, engineers or navigators to sustain a large air campaign.
She said: ""The first question we should ask isn't 'should we do it?' It's 'can we do it?'""
The Ministry of Defence said the RAF could sustain the campaign.
Parliament voted in favour of carrying out air strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria last week.
Ms Moon will travel to Iraq in the new year with other members of the defence committee as part of a review into the fight against IS.
Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics show, she said: ""We have a lack of pilots, we have a lack of engineers and we have a lack of navigators to actually get the planes in the air.
""People talk about the Typhoons (fighter jets) but the Typhoon can't carry the Brimstone missile which the Americans are so keen to utilise.""
The UK has been carrying out air strikes against IS fighters in Iraq since 2013 and according to Ms Moon, 30% of the ground occupied by IS has been won back.
But she has concerns the other 70% is now being discounted as attention turns to Syria.
She said: ""We made that same mistake in the past. We were in Afghanistan and in 2001 we went into Iraq and we divided our forces; we split our capability.
""Since then we've had a 30% cut in our armed forces and our armed capabilities and yet we're still thinking we can fight on two fronts. And for me that's not acceptable.""
An MoD spokesman said: ""The prime minister has already indicated we face a long and challenging campaign against Daesh.
""The RAF has the equipment, skills and personnel to sustain the campaign and will continue to deliver success for as long as it takes.
""Since parliament voted to extend air strikes into Syria, RAF deployment of Typhoons and Tornados has doubled the number of British fighter jets taking the fight to Daesh. The UK is part of a wider international coalition, whose forces have now damaged more than 13,500 targets and taken 30% of Daesh's territory.""",A MP has questioned whether the RAF has the capability to attack so-called Islamic State in both Syria and Iraq.,35087511
"Khadija Ibrahim, 30, told reporters she had been waiting for a bus to hospital in the north-eastern city of Maiduguri when she was seized by two men in a car who had offered her a lift.
While drugged, the mother of three was stripped and a suicide belt attached, she is quoted as saying.
She managed to flee her abductors.

Ms Ibrahim said after getting into the car, she fell unconscious when something was placed over her nose.
But she woke up, apparently without her captors realising, to hear one of them whispering to her that she was ""going to do God's work"".
The kidnappers told her she was being taken to the city of Kano to attack the Kantin Kwari textile market.
But when the car engine overheated, both kidnappers were distracted - one was examining the engine while the other went to look for water.
Ms Ibrahim then managed to flee and a man in the Hotoro neighbourhood of Kano took her to the police.
She was also brought before the Kano state governor, Umar Ganduje, who told the media: ""If this woman had not regained consciousness the story would have been  different by now.""
The woman is now in ""safe custody....undergoing post-traumatic rehabilitation,"" Kano police spokesman Magaji Musa Majiya told the BBC's Hausa service.
Police are trying to track down the vehicle in an attempt to find a second kidnapped girl, thought to be about 15 years old, he added.

"About 3,000 direct and indirect jobs were lost after the SSI plant closed.
The 90-page document by Lord Heseltine proposes a new development corporation as well as plans to increase tourism.
Redcar and Cleveland Council leader, Sue Jeffrey, said the area still had ""huge potential"".
The Labour council leader has been put on the new South Tees Development Corporation's board of local business people and local authority leaders charged with drawing up proposals for the use of the former steelworks site.
They had to ""come up with a vision for that whole site about how it could be regenerated, how it can be refreshed, how we can bring inward investment and jobs and actually make the most of what is a key industrial site for the whole of the Tees Valley"", she said.
The former Conservative deputy prime minister, Lord Heseltine, said he had been ""slightly surprised"" by the area's ""can-do attitude"".
""Wherever you go, you find bright, intelligent and hard working people who are determined to make a success of this place and know how to do it,"" he said.
Lord Heseltine wants to see more apprenticeships created, more starter homes built and a change in the industrial identity of Teesside to try to attract more tourists.
The steel works have been in the hands of receivers since the site's owner Sahaviriya Steel Industries UK (SSI) was wound up on 2 October.
The closure of the coke ovens and blast furnace saw the end of steel production at the 98-year-old Redcar works.

The state had failed to clarify how the payments would be handled after CPS's contract ends on 31 March.

Minister Bathabile Dlamini, who is in charge of the state's Social Security Agency (Sassa), has been facing growing calls to resign over how she has handled the crisis.

"John Hunter had diagnosed a patient in 1786 with a ""tumour as hard as bone"".
Royal Marsden Hospital doctors analysed patient samples and case notes, which were preserved at the museum named after him - the Hunterian in London.
As well as confirming the diagnosis, the cancer team believe Mr Hunter's centuries-old samples may give clues as to how cancer is changing over time.
""It started out as a bit of fun exploration, but we were amazed by John Hunter's insight,"" Dr Christina Messiou told the BBC News website.
Mr Hunter became surgeon to King George III in 1776 and is one of the surgeons credited with moving the medical discipline from butchery to a science.
He's also rumoured to have given himself gonorrhoea as an experiment while writing a book about venereal diseases.
His huge medical collection is now housed at the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons.
It includes his colourful notes describing a man who arrived at St George's Hospital, in 1786, with a hard swelling on his lower thigh.
""It appeared to be a thickening of the bone, it was increasing very rapidly... On examining the diseased part, it was found to consist of a substance surrounding the lower part of the thigh bone, of the tumour kind, which seemed to originate from the bone itself.""
Mr Hunter amputated the man's leg and he recovered briefly for four weeks.
""From this time he began to lose flesh and sink gradually, his breathing more and more difficult,"" the notes continued.
The patient died seven weeks after the operation and an autopsy discovered bony tumours had spread to his lungs, the lining of the heart and on the ribs.
More than 200 years later, the samples fell under the gaze of Dr Christina Messiou.
She said: ""Just looking at the specimens, the diagnosis of osteosarcoma came very quickly to me and John Hunter's write up was amazingly astute and fits with what we know about the behaviour of the disease.
""The large volumes of new bone formation and the appearance of the primary tumour are really characteristic of osteosarcoma.""
She went to get a second opinion from her colleagues at the Royal Marsden in central London.
And in an out-of-hours session at the hospital they used modern day scanning technology to confirm the centuries old diagnosis.
Dr Messiou, whose speciality is sarcoma, told the BBC: ""I think his diagnosis is really impressive and in fact his management of the patient followed similar principles to what we would have done in the modern day.""
But she says the exciting stage of the research is still to come.
They are now going to compare more of Hunter's historical samples with contemporary tumours - both microscopically and genetically - to see if there are any differences.
Dr Messiou told the BBC: ""It's a study of cancer evolution over 200 years and if we're honest we don't really know what we're going to find.
""But it would be interesting to see if we can link lifestyle risk factors with any differences that we see between historical and current cancers.
""So we've got big ambitions for the specimens.""
Writing in the British Medical Journal, the Royal Marsden team apologised for delay in analysing the samples from 1786 and the obvious breach of cancer waiting times, but point out their hospital was not built until 1851.

She has also competed at the World Championships but withdrew from the European Championships earlier this year in order to concentrate on her A-Levels.
Here, Amy answers questions set by BBC News School Reporters from Aston Manor Academy in Birmingham.
What or who made you get into sport?
I first got into gymnastics when I was two - my Mum took me along to baby gym sessions!
Describe what a typical day of training is like for you
As I am still at Sixth Form, training from day to day varies.
A normal day training is about six hours split over the day, with in that we do a few hours conditioning, stretching and working in skills and routines.
What keeps you motivated to train?
I think my motivation to train is the fact that I love competing, I love performing in front of big crowds and that really is a huge part of sport.
What do you eat in the day to keep you fuelled for training?
Generally, I start the day with a bowl of porridge to help maintain my energy throughout the morning.
For lunch I generally have a small number of carbs such as pasta or rice, some protein and some vegetables or salad.  And for dinner I would eat no carbs - protein and vegetables or salad only.
What do you think is the biggest myth about being a successful sportsperson?
I think the biggest myth would be if you are talented it's easy. Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard!

What is your favourite subject at school and why?
For me PE is my favourite subject. I really enjoy being able to relate it to my gymnastics training and learning about the history of sport.
Do you have a certain ritual or routine you follow before a competition and if so what?
I wouldn't say I have a certain ritual before a competition - I like to keep everything the same as what I'd do at home. I eat the same foods, sleep at the same time, etc.
But I wouldn't really say I do anything in particular before a competition.
What kind of support network do you think you need in the sports industry?
I have a big support network around me which I think would be good if it was available to all athletes - a Nutritionist and a Psychologist, Physios, Doctors and it goes without saying my coaches, family and friends are extremely important in my network.
What is your 'golden moment' so far in your career

"On Thursday, the Sun newspaper claimed the charity was earning £6m a year from recommending energy deals that were not the cheapest available.
Now the paper says Age UK earned £21.9m last year from selling insurance.
The charity said it ""strongly"" rejected the latest allegations, and interpretation of figures.
Deals on car insurance being promoted by Age UK did not appear to offer the best value for money, the Sun claimed.
An Age UK policy for a woman of 70 driving a 2005 Nissan Micra would cost £544, according to its website.
But Ageas, which supplies the policy, offers a cheaper deal under its Kwikfit brand, for just £371.
However, some of Age UK's other insurance deals were cheaper than rival quotes.
Conditions also vary from one policy to another.
Age UK said its prices were always competitive, but it had never claimed to be the cheapest at all times.
""We offer good value products that can be relied on by older people in a volatile market place,"" a spokesperson said.
""For example, our insurance products have no cancellation or change fees, no upper age limits, interest free instalments, are Which? recommended and achieve Defaqto five star ratings. Any net profits go straight to charitable activity supporting vital work for vulnerable older people.""
The energy regulator Ofgem and the Charity Commission said on Thursday that they would investigate Age UK's behaviour.
But speaking to the BBC, the Charity Commission said its powers were limited to examining the role of trustees.
Michelle Russell, director of investigations at the Charity Commission, said fund-raising was ""self-regulating"".
""Our role is about holding trustees to account, and ensuring they comply with the law - and that's exactly what we're doing,"" she told Radio 4's Today Programme.
But one commentator said she was surprised that the Commission's powers were so limited.
""The public has always assumed that someone - the Charity Commission - is overseeing these charities,"" said Harriet Sergeant, an analyst with the think tank the Centre for Policy Studies.
""We've suddenly realised they don't seem to be overseen at all.""
The Charity Commission is due to get more powers to investigate trustees under the new Charities (Protection and Social Investment) Bill, expected to get Royal Assent by the end of February.
However, it will not extend its powers to examine fund-raising.

The trial is designed to give England players practice for a Test match.
The game against the West Indies at Edgbaston in August is a first for the UK, with the pink ball intended to be more visible than a red one during the evening session under flood-lights.
Cardiff's SSE Swalec Stadium will be one of nine venues hosting a first-ever full round of Championship games starting at 14:00 BST.
The one-off match against Kent in September 2011 is the only previous Championship game to have been staged as a day-night affair, with the time of year making conditions unpleasant for a very sparse crowd.
""The balls are different, it's going to be different and I can see the reasons why the ECB is trying it out,"" Wagg told BBC Wales Sport.
The 34 year-old all-rounder, who joined Glamorgan from Derbyshire, claimed five wickets in the previous four-day match under lights.
""The ball itself wasn't great, they do swing to start with but it's almost a sort of paint on the ball rather than leather, whether that's improved since 2011 I don't know,"" he said.
""It was horrible and cold at that time of year, and there was no atmosphere, but hopefully people will come along and support us.""

"Sammy claims West Indies will be taking on a whole nation in Mumbai (14:30 BST), but the spotlight may fall on two men - Chris Gayle and Virat Kohli.
Kohli scored 82 off 51 balls in India's six-wicket win over Australia, while Sammy's side slipped up to Afghanistan.
""It is going to be a hell of a game,"" said the 32-year-old.
""It is going to be 15 West Indian players versus thousands and how many billion here in India. It is a challenge we are ready to face.
""The guys who predict the results, I think they say it's 80-20 to India, so it feels like a David and Goliath - but people tend to forget that David won the fight. It is something similar to that.""
And Sammy does not fear Kohli, adding: ""Have you ever heard of Chris Gayle?""
Gayle is 36 and part of an ageing West Indies squad who hope to reach what could be their last World Twenty20 final.
""The next T20 World Cup is in four years,"" explained Sammy. ""The 'World Universe Boss' [Gayle] will be 40.
""I will be 36, so yes, we really put our all into this tournament and the guys in the dressing room are aware of what's at stake.
""It is six steps to the cup. We have taken four, we had a little pothole in the road [against Afghanistan]. I think this year could be the year for the West Indies.""
India openers Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan have managed just 88 runs between them in four matches, while Yuvraj Singh has been ruled out of the remainder of the tournament with an ankle injury.
Kohli has been key in guiding his country into the last four, following 55 against arch-rival Pakistan with that unbeaten knock in the must-win last group match against Australia.
Team director Ravi Shastri says India's top order has not performed well enough so far and maintains there can be no complacency, having opened the tournament with defeat against New Zealand.
""You need a performance in a big game. You have to get your 'A' game,"" said Shastri.
""West Indies are probably one of the most dangerous sides in this format - they have got explosive players and match winners.
""We know what we are up against, but we are up and ready as well.""
Left-hander Yuvraj twisted his ankle during Sunday's win over Australia, and struggled to make 21 from 18 balls.
Manish Pandey, 26, has replaced him in the squad, while Ajinkya Rahane is also in contention for the semi-final XI.
India have fielded the same side in all four of their group matches, with right-handed batsman Rahane, off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, left-arm spinner Pawan Negi and pace bowler Mohammad Shami the unused players in their 15-man squad.
""I still believe we have played to 70% of our ability in this tournament so there's 30% where we can improve,"" added Shastri.
""You can't depend on one or two players, you need six to seven players to step up. It has not happened really in this tournament, let's hope tomorrow it's a start.""
New Zealand and West Indies meet in the Women's World Twenty20 semi-final on Thursday, with the winner set to face Australia in Sunday's final in Kolkata.

"There is increasing worry about internet grooming, due to the growth in the use of webcams and 'apps' that allow people to chat online.
Childline received 4,896 calls from Northern Ireland last year  - sexual abuse accounted for 275 calls (5.6%).
The charity held 164 counselling sessions over online sex abuse with young people from Northern Ireland.
Neil Anderson, head of the NSPCC in Northern Ireland, said: ""Most of us talk to people online and it's a great way to stay connected and make new friends.
""But it can be a playground for paedophiles, exposing young people to groomers who trawl social networks and online game forums exploiting any vulnerabilities they may find.""

"What's more, their maximum crushing force is stronger than the bite force of all land animals, except the alligator.
Coconut crabs are remarkably strong, lifting up to 28 kilograms (62lb) - the weight of a small child.
They use their claws to fight and defend themselves, as well as to crack open coconut shells.
At up to one-metre (3 ft) across, coconut crabs are also the largest of all land-based arthropods - the group that includes insects, spiders and crustaceans.
They live on small islands in the tropical Indian and Pacific oceans.
Researchers in Japan measured the squeezing force of 29 wild coconut crabs living on Okinawa Island using a sensor.
They calculated that a large crab could be expected to exert a squeezing force of more than 3000 newtons, which exceeds other crustaceans, such as lobsters.
""The mighty claws of these crabs are useful weapons to deter predators and competitors,"" say scientists from the Okinawa Churashima Foundation.
""In summary, coconut crabs have the ability to exert the greatest force among almost all terrestrial animals.""
Coconut crabs are well adapted to life on land.
Unlike most crabs, they only return to the sea to lay their eggs.
They can also climb trees and cut coconuts down.
Despite their size and strength, little is known about coconut crabs and whether or not they are a threatened species.
Charles Darwin described the coconut crab as of ""monstrous size"" when he saw them on the Cocos (Keeling Islands) in the Indian Ocean during the voyage of the Beagle.
He wrote: ""To show the wonderful strength of the front pair of pincers, I may mention that Captain Moresby confined one in a strong tin box, which had held biscuits, the lid being secured with wire; but the crab turned down the edges and escaped.
""In turning down the edges it actually punched many small holes quite through the tin!""

"Anne Longfield has written to French authorities to ask them to speed up the asylum claims of 150 children who may be eligible to travel to the UK.
She also claims the French are not properly protecting lone children at the camp, saying 129 have gone missing.
The children, some as young as 10, have fled fighting in Syria and elsewhere.
Ms Longfield told BBC Breakfast that unaccompanied children at the camp were very vulnerable.
""We're talking about cardboard shacks - it rains, they fall down. They're by themselves, it's extraordinarily dangerous, they're at risk of health [problems], trafficking, any manner of danger there.
""They're not being protected while they're there [and] some of those children are actually eligible to join their close family here.""
In her letter, Ms Longfield also expresses concern about children who are thought to have disappeared since the French authorities dismantled parts of the camp, known as the Jungle, earlier this year.
""The charities working with them have tried hard to trace them and the authorities must do likewise,"" she said.
Charity workers are said to have identified the children who are potentially eligible to move to the UK because they have parents or siblings there.
Ms Longfield's call follows a visit to the camp to meet children living there alone while waiting for their cases to be reviewed.
She said: ""I have asked the French authorities to urgently determine which of the children in the Calais refugee camp are eligible to come to the UK, to ensure their safety and to process their applications immediately.
""It is unacceptable that at the moment some are waiting up to nine months before they learn whether or not they can come.

Scotland's output is now 99.9% of the UK average, having increased from 94.5% in 2007.
Scottish government statisticians said the nation continued to lag the UK in terms of output per job.
By that measure, labour productivity increased by 2.1% in 2015 to stand at 97.8% of the average UK value.

"He was once quoted as saying he had two passions in life: travel and photography.
""I was born in Nice in 1959 and soon discovered the mountain in Mercantour (in the French Alps) with my father and walked the first peaks. So I've had one desire: to return as often as possible,"" he told France's Le Monde newspaper.
He said he was simply lucky that his qualifications allowed him to ""earn a living away from the offices"", climbing and skiing.

"The nations are divided into 11 electoral regions: nine in England, plus Scotland and Wales.
Parties vying for election submit a list of candidates to the electorate in each region for their approval.
A system devised by Victor D'Hondt, a Belgian lawyer and mathematician active in the 19th Century, dictates the results:
By way of example, here are the results for one region of England, the West Midlands, in 2009, which had a total of six seats in the European Parliament up for grabs. For simplicity's sake, only the five largest parties by vote share are included:
The Conservatives win the largest number of votes, and the candidate at the top of their list is elected.
As the Conservatives already have one candidate elected, their vote is divided by two (one, plus the number of MEPs they have). Now UKIP comes out on top, and the candidate at the top of their list of candidates is elected.
After UKIP's vote is divided by two (one plus the number of MEPs they have), Labour wins and its top candidate for the region is also elected.
After Labour's vote has been divided by two, the Conservatives are back on top. The candidate in second place on their list is elected.
Since two Conservatives have now been elected, their original vote tally is divided by three (one plus the number of MEPs elected), and the Lib Dems secure top spot and their first MEP for the region.
The Lib Dem vote is now divided by two (one plus the one MEP from round 5), leaving UKIP to top this round and win a seat for the second person on its list. All six seats in the European Parliament for the region have been allocated.
In Northern Ireland, a different system is used to elect its three MEPs.
Voters have a ""single transferable vote"", meaning that they are able to rank the candidates in order of preference.
To make the system work, officials first need to calculate a quota. They take the total number of valid votes cast, then divide it by the number of seats available plus one, i.e. four, then add one.
In the first round, if any candidate secures more first-preference votes than the quota, they are elected.
Surplus votes, i.e. those received above the quota, are redistributed among the other candidates.
If not enough candidates have yet reached the quota, then the candidate with the lowest number of votes is eliminated, and the lower-preference votes of their supporters are again re-allocated.
This process is repeated until the three posts have been filled.","Seats in the European Parliament representing England, Scotland and Wales are distributed according to the D'Hondt system, a type of proportional representation.",27187434
"The tours allow fans to scale Glasgow Central Station's glass roof and see the site of what was a Victorian village buried underground.
Tickets are Â£10 per person, with profits covering staff costs and improvements to the 135-year-old station.
The 90-minute tours will run three days a week, usually at weekends.
The move follows the overwhelming success in summer 2013 of a Doors Open Day, which allowed the public on the station's roof for the first time.
The limited number of tours sold out almost immediately and plans were drawn up to run more extensive tours on a permanent basis, with an initial start date of January this year.
However, a Â£2m series of renovations to the building's toilets and entrances at the beginning of the year, followed by the unprecedented surge in passengers during the Commonwealth Games, forced station managers to push back the project.
More recently, delays in completing the booking website for customers prevented the tours from getting under way by the start of November.
Network Rail, which owns the station, said the tours would explore ""everywhere from the top of the glass roof - the largest in the world, with 48,000 panes of glass compared to Edinburgh Waverley's 17,000 - to the old steam engine boiler rooms and derelict tunnels in the basement"".
Visitors will climb 90 steps and walk across catwalks above the station concourse to access the giant roof area.
At its highest point, the roof stands 40ft above the concourse.
It was completely renewed in 1998 as part of an Â£80m station renovation.
Once on the roof, visitors will be able to enjoy panoramic views across the River Clyde and city skyline.
From there, tourists will descend winding stairwells to see what remains of the Victorian streets of Grahamston village, which once bustled with shops and activity before the station was built over the top of it in 1879.
Ross Moran, the station's manager, said: ""Central Station has played a vital role in the social and economic life of the city for 135 years and we are looking forward to being able to share the sights and stories of the station with the public.

"Bath MP Don Foster made the call after he organised a ""seagull summit"" for local authorities affected by the problem.
A study carried out by Bristol University in 2010 found an estimated 1,100 pairs in Bath, 2,500 in Bristol and 2,900 in Gloucester.
The MP has called for a research fund to be created which would be supported by UK councils.
Mr Foster said: ""What I am proposing with a group of MPs is that we go to each of the councils that are affected who are already spending millions on this.
""If they put a small amount in over a three-year period, then we can get this research done.""
He added that he had already lobbied government for the past five years to fund the research but his efforts had failed.
The MP has also said government research into gull numbers showed there were about 30,000 breeding pairs in the country but Bristol University findings led by seagull expert Peter Rock had estimated a much higher figure of 100,000 pairs.
""We simply don't know very much - the vast majority of research that's been done has been done on wild gulls living on cliff tops and so on.
""We've got very little on urban gulls and they are growing in number,"" explained Mr Foster.
""Despite all of the methods - everything from putting spikes on top of buildings, loud noises, bird scarers, oiling of eggs - none of them have worked and that's predominantly because we don't know enough about urban seagulls.""

"The victims were ambushed by unknown attackers when travelling between Juba and the town of Pibor to the northeast.
Oxfam said the attack ""demonstrates how dangerous it is here"" and was leading agencies to re-evaluate ""what is mission-critical and what is not"".
Aid deliveries would continue but could be delayed, it said.
The latest fatal attack on humanitarian workers came a month after famine was declared in parts of Unity state in northern South Sudan.
The UN says the famine - the first to be announced anywhere in the world in six years - is man-made, resulting from a political conflict that escalated into war in 2013.
Some of the areas worst affected by food shortages are seen as sympathetic to rebel groups and critics of the government have accused it of blocking aid deliveries. South Sudanese officials deny this.
Oxfam humanitarian campaigns manager Dorothy Sang, who is in South Sudan, told the BBC it was ""one of the most difficult countries to operate in right now"".
She said attacks on aid workers ""unfortunately aren't uncommon"" - 12 have been killed this year alone and there have been a number of other, non-fatal attacks on aid convoys and warehouses.
She said Oxfam would continue delivering aid but was reassessing how this could be done with least risk.
Transporting aid by road was now ""extremely dangerous"" and agencies were considering whether they could step up transportation by air, and whether risks on the road could be reduced by aid organisations travelling in convoy.
This re-evaluation of risks could mean that aid deliveries were delayed, Ms Sang said.
""The brutal killing... has sent shockwaves through us all,"" said Care International country director Fred McCray. ""It is unacceptable that those trying to alleviate the suffering... are attacked for what they do.""
Source: World Food Programme
The Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) programme director for South Sudan Monica Blagescu said: ""This is the crude reality of the situation in South Sudan, where humanitarian workers put their lives at risk while providing life-saving assistance to people affected by conflict and drought.
""Those in a position of power must step up to their responsibilities and stop such heinous incidents from happening again.""
In many cases of assaults on aid agencies, it is not known who the attackers are. There are many armed groups in South Sudan, engaged in a battle for power and resources.
South Sudanese rebels have blamed government forces for the killings on Saturday.
A spokesman for the Sudan People's Liberation Movement - In Opposition, which is led by former Vice-President Riek Machar, condemned the attack and called for an investigation.
""The area where this barbaric incident took place is under the control of [the] Juba regime and its militias,"" the spokesman, Paul Gabriel Lam, was reported by the Paris-based Sudan Tribune as saying.
The government has said it is too early to say who was behind the attack and it would be ""counterproductive"" to assign blame ""at this stage"".
Grieving families went to the morgue in Juba on Monday to collect the bodies of their relatives.
""This is very painful for all of us,"" Levis Kori, whose 30-year-old brother John Riti was killed in the attack, told AP new agency.
""They were humanitarians there to do good. They're not soldiers, they have no guns.""
The attack comes at a critical time for aid agencies in South Sudan, which are trying to pre-position stocks in key areas before the expected arrival of the rains in the coming weeks.
The rainy season makes access much harder for aid agencies and brings greater risk that malnourished people, already vulnerable to illness, will catch water-borne diseases.
The DEC has warned that ""a toxic mix of drought and violent conflict"" means South Sudan is now the world's fastest growing refugee crisis.
It says 6,000 people a day - equating to four people a minute - were forced to flee to neighbouring Uganda last month.
There are now more refugees fleeing to Uganda than across the Mediterranean, the DEC says.","Aid agencies say the ""shocking"" killing of six aid workers in South Sudan on Saturday is causing them to re-assess how and when they can deliver supplies.",39407176

"A new technique uses a long tube to quickly sample the air above suspected gravesites.
The specially coated tube can spot tiny amounts of a chemical linked to the breakdown of animal remains, up to months after the remains are buried.
The research is published in Forensic Science International and highlighted in New Scientist magazine.
The task is to outperform the premier detector of hidden explosives, drugs, or humans alive or dead: the sniffer dog. But as much as dogs can be trained, it remains unclear what exactly they perceive.
""We're not really sure what the dogs are sniffing or what they're focusing on,"" said Tom Bruno of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Nist) in the US.
""And dogs can be difficult to control, and uncertain,"" he told BBC News. ""Recently we've come to think dogs aren't sniffing an explosive, but cyclohexanone, a chemical used to re-crystallise the explosive.
""What if the bomb makers switch to using another chemical instead?""
In order to win out over the dog's abilities in finding hidden graves, Dr Bruno and his colleague Tara Lovestead adapted their ""headspace analysis"" technique, originally developed to detect explosives and more recently adapted to sniff out food spoilage.
Shedding light
At the heart of the approach is the use of a long tube lined with two materials: alumina, a porous but tough material that soaks up molecules from the air, and ninhydrin, a molecule that binds both to alumina and to the clues indicating a hidden grave.
Almost all animal tissue is made up of proteins, which after death break down into constituent parts, some of which end up free in the air. In mammals, the structure of many of these decomposition products - with evocative names such as cadaverine - is known.
When these products encounter ninhydrin, a particular bond is formed - a bond that absorbs light of a particular colour.
At one end of the tube is a source of ultraviolet light and at the other a detector. The more decomposition products that settle in the tube, the more light gets absorbed along the way; the light level is then an indirect measure of the presence of decomposing flesh.
To set up their ""gravesites"" to be tested, the researchers placed rat cadavers on top of or buried underneath soil in a number of compartments. Other compartments were left with soil only.
Their detection technique accurately spotted the presence of the cadavers, at times ranging up to 20 weeks after burial - the decomposition process eventually exhaust the supply of proteins.
Dr Bruno says that the team will carry on applying the technique to a range of ""sniffing"" problems, and that they are already in discussions to commercialise the idea.
It may be some time before the technique can routinely outperform a dog's nose, but may become indispensable for cases in which a grave may be hidden beneath more than just soil.
""In large areas, it would be a supplement to other methods or dogs,"" Dr Bruno said.
""But in small areas, or if you suspect there's something buried under a concrete slab, it's probably the best way.""","A ""sniffer tube"" could replace dogs in the arsenal of tools to locate hidden graves, say researchers.",10919441

"There is still more than a month to go before Bell leads Warwickshire out for the County Championship opener against Hampshire at Southampton on 10 April, the day before his 34th birthday.
But Evans says that, even in pre-season training, he has made a difference.
""He sets an example in the way he works and goes about things,"" said Evans.
""I've loved it. He brings an intensity to everything he does, which is what you need if you want to go to the next level.
""He's brought that international work ethic. He trains differently, he thinks differently, he plays differently. He's probably better than the rest of us, so it's nice to watch him play.""
Having spent the past decade as an England regular, Ian Bell's omission from the South Africa winter tour has raised doubts about his Test future.
But, having already retired from one-day international cricket with England, Bell himself has no intentions of packing in yet at Test level too.
The fact that Joe Root, Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow were England's only reliable run getters on the four-match tour suggests that he still has a Test future - especially if he can find his form in early season.
James Taylor (201 runs), Alex Hales (192), Moeen Ali (116) all averaged under 30 for the series, considerably below Bell's overall Test average of 42.69.
Ian Bell has squeezed in just 21 County Championship appearances for Warwickshire in the past six years - and even that is a higher appearance rate than most of his England contemporaries in that time.
But, having him back in the team, and even more fired up to score runs in an attempt to win back his England place, can only strengthen the Bears' bid to improve on last season's fifth-placed finish.
""As a group we ended last season poorly,"" said Evans. ""We weren't going about our cricket the right way, both on and off the field.
""There were times we were not enjoying it. We needed the end of the season to come. Hopefully we can put that behind us.
""A winter down, hopefully we've put right some of those things. The real test is when we have that first session when things have not quite gone our way. That will show the character of the side.""
Ian Bell led the Bears to a 13-run defeat in Friday's first of two Twenty20 warm-up friendlies against the West Indies, at the Dubai International Stadium.
Responding to the Windies' 145-5, the Bears failed to plunder 23 off the final over, falling short on 132-4, despite 35 for Bell and opening partner Varun Chopra's 41.
Laurie Evans will captain for the second of the meetings with the Windies on Sunday. The Bears then have five days of training ahead of the two-day game with Midlands neighbours Worcestershire in the Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi the following weekend.
""It was disappointing not to get over the line,"" said Bell. ""But we played against a high-class international team who've been out here for some time. We're 48 hours off the plane. Even without some of our senior players, we pushed them close.""",Warwickshire batsman Laurie Evans says that having England's Ian Bell as their new captain is already proving an inspiration to the Bears playing staff.,35725631
"The Danish toy company is making a new set of five figurines, based on real female scientists, engineers and astronauts.
The design, created by US science writer Maia Weinstock, won the Lego Ideas competition.
The characters will be available in late 2017 or early 2018.
The design was picked by the company after receiving 10,000 public votes, which made it eligible for consideration.
Ms Weinstock said: ""The reaction has been overwhelming. Messages of congratulations and excitement at the prospect of this set actually being on store shelves have been pouring in.""
The five women portrayed are:
Ms Johnson was also a character in the recent, Oscar-nominated film Hidden Figures, which tells the story of female African-American mathematicians working at Nasa in the 1960s.
Lego Ideas spokeswoman Lise Dydensborg announced the result in a video message, accompanied by a drum roll.
She said the company was excited about the set.
""As a science editor and writer, with a strong personal interest for space exploration as well as the history of women in science and engineering, Maia Weinstock's Women of Nasa project was a way for her to celebrate accomplished women in the Stem professions,"" she said.
The so-called stem professions (science, technology, engineering and maths) are often male-dominated.
""I hope it sets a new example for both girls and boys,"" said Ms Weinstock. ""Girls, in that they can and should be engineers, scientists, and mathematicians, and boys, in that they internalise at an early age that these careers are for everyone, not only men.""
The Lego Ideas competition takes place twice a year, and one or two winners are selected for production.
Other contenders in the latest competition included Lego scenes from televisions shows The Addams Family and The Little House on the Prairie, a Lego Lamborghini and a Lego Large Hadron Collider.
One Lego fan, who runs Jay's Brick Blog, said the Nasa set was a worthy winner.
In a blog post, he said he was familiar with Margaret Hamilton's work but had to look up the other four women.
He continued, ""Imagine this very scenario extended to young kids and parents taking the time to not only build this set with their kids, but to also explain who these women are and why their contributions were so important to space exploration and astronomy.""

"Figures collated by Prof Chris Oliver, a consultant at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital, showed 252 people have suffered injuries.
A breakdown of the statistics indicated 191 of those injured were cyclists.
Prof Oliver, who specialises in trauma and orthopaedic surgeries, will present his figures later this year to the British Orthopaedic Organisation.
There have been 119 men and 72 women (total 191 patients) with cycling injuries from tram tracks.
The most common injury was from getting the bike wheel caught in the tram track (142) while the second was the wheel sliding on a tram track (32).
Accidents due to wheels sliding on the tram tracks were more likely to happen in wet conditions.
At least 55 patients had upper limb fractures or dislocations, while eight sustained lower limb fractures and two had facial fractures.
One sustained both upper and lower limb fractures and one had facial and lower limb fractures.
Prof Oliver said: ""We deal with thousands of fractures a year in the Royal and it's become a new work steam for us.
""It's not the £1m cost to the NHS, the problem is the suffering caused by the accidents and people having time off work, often ending up with some chronic disability with reduced function in a wrist or a shoulder and perhaps not getting back to sport, not being inclined to get back to cycling.

"Mr Mallon was arrested in Rio over a week ago in possession of hundreds of tickets earmarked for the Olympic Council of Ireland.
Mr Hickey, 71, was detained by Brazilian police on Wednesday.
The pair are being held together in the notorious Bangu 10 Rio prison.
On Saturday, a Brazilian judge said that Mr Hickey was remanded in custody on Friday because he was a flight risk.
The OCI board is due to meet on Sunday evening to discuss the issue.
A spokeswoman for the OCI said it is awaiting the return of some board members from Rio.
Irish broadcaster RTÃ‰ reports that former Olympic silver medal winner Sonia O'Sullivan, the Football Association of Ireland chief executive John Delaney, and head of Swim Ireland Sarah Keane are among the board members due to attend the meeting.
Mr Hickey denies the allegations against him but has stepped down from all his posts temporarily.
He served as head of the Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI) as well as the European Olympic body, and also sat on the executive board of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
On Friday, Irish Sports Minister Shane Ross announced an inquiry into the ticketing claims, following a meeting with Attorney General MÃ¡ire Whelan.
The inquiry would be chaired by a retired judge who would be appointed next week, said Mr Ross, adding that he hoped it would complete its work in 12 weeks.
Who is Pat Hickey?
Mr Hickey left hospital in a wheelchair on Thursday night and was taken to a police station in Rio where he gave a statement to investigators, reports say.
He was then denied bail by the Court of Justice, and transferred to prison.
Bangu penitentiary complex houses some of Brazil's most dangerous inmates and is famous for its bloody gang violence.
It has been the scene of murders and riots and several of its officials have been killed.
In December 2005, a security chief became the fifth official from the jail to be murdered in five years.
In 2013, 27 inmates escaped from the sprawling complex by crawling through the sewage system.
However, a women's jail in the complex hosts an annual beauty contest.
Mr Hickey's colleagues at the Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI) have said they will fully cooperate with any Irish state inquiry into the sale of tickets for Rio 2016.
In a statement on Friday it said Mr Hickey was ""receiving his own legal advice and is entitled to natural justice and due process"".
It said independent legal advisers had been appointed to advise the council's board.
It added that it ""would cooperate fully with a state inquiry and it will now appoint an external independent firm to carry out a review"".
The council said its board regretted that ""recent events in Brazil have overshadowed the many great performances of Team Ireland at the Rio Olympic Games"".
The OCI said it would also commission its own independent inquiry into the ticketing scandal.
Mr Hickey was dramatically arrested on Wednesday in his hotel room over his alleged role in a scheme to sell Olympic tickets for a higher price than their face value.
He was escorted off the premises wearing his dressing gown to face questions.
But he complained of heart problems and spent time in Samaritano Hospital in Rio de Janeiro before being taken to a police station for questioning on Thursday night.

"Toure, 30, has 22 goals this season, helping City to win the League Cup and challenge for the Premier League title.
To be honest, proper recognition has only come from the fans
Samir Nasri recently said Toure would be celebrated as one of the world's best midfielders were he not African.
In an interview for Football Focus on BBC World News, he said: ""I think what Samir was saying was definitely true.""
The midfielder has won league titles in four countries - Ivory Coast, Greece, Spain and England - and was part of the Barcelona team that won the Champions League in 2009.
He also feels fellow countryman Didier Drogba and Cameroon's Samuel Eto'o are undervalued because they are African.
""To be honest, proper recognition has only come from the fans,"" said the three-time African player of the year, also voted BBC African footballer of the year in 2013. ""I don't want to be hard and I don't want to be negative, but I want to be honest.""
Toure feels the media should do more to promote African players.
""If we play well and we don't have the recognition from the media, we are not going to be where we want to be,"" he said.
Premier League 2013-14
Statistics provided by Opta
Toure also feels African players need to do far more to stand out, drawing comparisons with Barcelona duo Andres Iniesta and Xavi, both former team-mates of his.
He says Iniesta and Xavi are often praised for their attacking skills, but rarely singled out for criticism when they fail to defend properly.
In contrast, Toure claims he is regularly picked on by the media when he makes a defensive mistake.
The Ivorian is also unhappy that Lionel Messi, widely regarded as one of the best players in the world along with Cristiano Ronaldo, is recognised around the world but players like himself are not.
He said: ""If you go to any part of Africa now, people will say, 'yes, we know him [Messi]', but when you come to Europe and say 'Yaya Toure' people will say, 'who is that?' Some will say they know my name but not know my face. But they will know Messi's face.""
Toure, who played in Belgium, Ukraine, Greece, France and Spain before moving to England, says he will be disappointed if he is not named player of the year by the Professional Footballers' Association.
He is one of six players on the shortlist, alongside Chelsea's Eden Hazard, Southampton's Adam Lallana and the Liverpool trio of Luis Suarez, Steven Gerrard and Daniel Sturridge.

International debut: 2004, caps 82
Asked if he would be unhappy not to win the award, Toure replied: ""Definitely. As a champion, as a winner, I always want to win.""
Asked to reflect on the fact there has only been one African winner of the Ballon d'Or - former AC Milan and Liberia striker George Weah in 1995 - Toure cited the significant contributions made by players such as fellow Africans Eto'o and Drogba at club level.
""Those players are more than legends for me and Africa,"" said Toure.
Asked if he knew if players such as Eto'o and Drogba also felt under-appreciated, the former Barcelona player replied: ""Definitely.""

"John O'Neill, from York, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme it ""must be horrific"" for them to see his sexual predilections shared online.
Mr O'Neill, who said he had an interest in sado-masochism, was cleared of rape last year but subjected to the order and could be jailed if he ignores it.
North Yorkshire Police said it was satisfied the order was proportionate.
Mr O'Neill said he had not had sex since the restrictions were imposed on him.
He said the interim sexual risk order (SRO) had resulted in a ""devastating"" effect on his personal life, saying his children - who are aged 12 and 16 and live abroad -  had deleted him on Facebook.
He claimed one of his friends ""has been threatened with being fired [from her job], just because she knows me"".
Mr O'Neill's identity was made public last week after an order protecting his anonymity was lifted at York Magistrates Court.
In June he had threatened to go on hunger strike in protest at the restrictions.
The SRO requires Mr O'Neill to disclose any planned sexual activity to the police or face up to five years in prison.
SROs can be applied to any individual who the police believe poses a risk of sexual harm - even if they have never been convicted of a crime. But Mr O'Neill said he was ""amazed"" the police sought one after his acquittal.
""It is the only crime I have ever been accused of,"" he said.
The police applied for the order in part after the judge at the rape trial called Mr O'Neill ""dangerous"". The father-of-two denied being dangerous and said the police had misinterpreted the judge's words.
He is to have a full hearing in August, when magistrates will decide whether to impose a longer order of up to five years.
Mr O'Neill described it as a ""rape trial in miniature"" with the same witnesses and evidence.
He said the SRO had effectively allowed police ""to ignore [the court's] verdict.""
He said he had not had sex since the order was imposed, but stands accused of breaching another of the SRO conditions by not giving police the pin number to his mobile phone.
North Yorkshire Police said in a statement it ""will only make an application to the court for a Sexual Risk Order in circumstances where it is considered necessary to do so to protect the public from the risk of sexual harm"".

"Friends and relatives joined the miners for the service, held close to the entrance to the San Jose mine
The miners were mobbed by reporters on their arrival at the camp, despite their complaints about media intrusion.
Some 50 people, including other miners, protested that they had not been able to work since 5 August.
The service of thanksgiving on Sunday was jointly led by an evangelical pastor and a Roman Catholic priest. Some of the rescuers who helped bring the miners to the surface, on Wednesday, also attended.
Many of the men were believers before the accident, says the BBC's Gideon Long at the San Jose mine, and several have said they feel closer to God as a result of their experience.
The service was private, with hordes of journalists waiting outside the tent where the ceremony took place.
Juan Illanes, one of the rescued miners, appealed to the media to respect the miners' privacy.
""We arrived at the conclusion that it would be very good if you, the media, instead of treating this as an entertainment story - as we have seen in some headlines, I'm talking about Johnny Barrios - please take into consideration his state of mind and respect his privacy,"" he said.
In pictures: Thanksgiving service
Johnny Barrios is the miner whose wife only found out he had a mistress of 10 years' standing when they both attended a vigil for him at the mine.
Some of the miners who were not trapped underground complained that they were not allowed in the tent at the San Jose mine for the service of thanksgiving.
About 50 people, including workers not on shift on 5 August when the mineshaft collapsed, took part in a protest. They have not been able to work since 5 August, when the mineshaft collapsed.
""We are not 33, we are 300,"" read one of their placards.
Jose Henriquez, an evangelical pastor who led the miners in prayer while they were underground, became the first of the 33 to return to the San Jose mine when he went back on Saturday.
He said he wanted to get to know the area, known as Camp Hope, where families waited for news of their relatives trapped in the mine.
""It is a joy to be free, I'm so happy to be back in this place so I can thank the Lord I'm with my family again,"" he said.
""I wanted to see this place and see where my family spent so long waiting for me.""
Doctors say all the miners are in good health; only one, Victor Zamora, remains in hospital, suffering from dental problems.
Doctors will continue to monitor the 33 miners for signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, said Dr Jorge Diaz, head of the miners' medical team at Copiapo regional hospital.
""We have a group of workers who are absolutely normal people, they weren't selected from a group of applicants to be astronauts, nor were they people who underwent rigorous tests, therefore we don't know when the post-traumatic stress syndrome can appear,"" Dr Diaz said.
On Saturday the miners began removing the sunglasses they had been wearing since they emerged into daylight on Wednesday.
They made an agreement to disclose few details of their ordeal while they negotiate book and film rights to their story.
A few of the miners say they intend to return to the same line of work.
""It is my work,"" Omar Reygadas told the Associated Press news agency. ""It is my way of earning pesos. I am a mole, and I'm happy when I am underground.""
""We are always going to carry on being miners,"" said Dario Segovia, speaking to the Spanish news agency, Efe. ""It leaves us a little bit worried - this journalistic siege.

"The move has generated great controversy in Japan.
A nuclear reactor generates power with nuclear fission, the decaying of unstable materials like uranium contained in fuel rods.
This generates radiation which in turn gives off heat, and this heat is transferred to electricity-generating turbines by a coolant - usually water.
The process, if unchecked, could create a dangerous release of energy. It is controlled by inserting rods containing material whichs absorb some of the radiation.
You stop a nuclear reactor by inserting enough of these control rods. ""Although the nuclear fission is still happening, it's not generating enough radiation for electricity,"" says Shaun Hendry, a physics professor with the University of Auckland.
To restart a reactor, workers remove enough of the control rods so that nuclear fission ramps up until it reaches a point called criticality - where it is generating enough heat to produce electricity and the process is self-sustaining.
Sendai's plant is expected to reach criticality by the end of Tuesday.
The Fukushima meltdown in 2011 happened because the plant lost power after it was swamped by the tsunami. It lost the ability to cool the nuclear reactor, leading to an explosive build-up of heat and gas.
Critics said that nuclear plants near the sea should have higher sea walls and better back-up generators.
The Japanese government has since required energy companies to implement better safety measures.
These range from more stringent safety checks on nuclear plants' ability to withstand earthquakes and meltdowns; better back-up power systems; and improving remote control systems so that reactors can be safely shut down from a distance.
They are also required to have more reliable evacuation and contingency plans which cover a wider area than before.
Japan, a resource-poor country, has relied on nuclear power to supply up to 30% of its energy needs.
But since the shutdown of reactors, the country's nine energy companies have had to buy expensive fossil fuels to cover the shortfall. They have been paying 3.6 trillion yen (Â£18.5bn, $28.9bn) more every year.
Some of these costs have been passed on to consumers, resulting in electricity prices going up by about 30%.
Using fossil fuels has made it more difficult for Japan to meet its targets in reducing carbon emissions.
Energy companies have also been saddled with huge amounts of spent fuel and plutonium, which are usually recycled into usable nuclear power fuel.
The companies have heavily lobbied the government to restart the Sendai power plant.
Though many Japanese are unhappy with having to pay more for electricity, they remain wary of another nuclear meltdown after Fukushima, which not only contaminated surrounding land but had a huge social impact on evacuated communities.
Many have called for greater reliance on renewable energy. But while the government intends to eventually have wind and solar energy make up 30% of Japan's energy supply, it is still less constant and reliable than nuclear, says Nobumasa Akiyama, a public policy professor at Hitotsubashi University.
He adds: ""The basic idea now is a mix of reducing fossil fuels, increasing renewable energy, and keeping nuclear power, as well as investing in more technology to save energy.""
There are 25 other plants applying to restart, but the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Tokyo says it is doubtful that all will get approval soon because of the significant public opposition.","Japan is restarting a nuclear reactor in Sendai, the first to go online after the 2011 Fukushima disaster prompted a nationwide shutdown of all plants.",33858444
"The literacy and numeracy signature programme created the equivalent of 270 extra full-time teaching posts and cost £16m.
It helped 19,000 pupils struggling with English and Maths.
This was in around 300 selected primary and post-primary schools.
Education Minister John O'Dowd said it was ""disappointing"" the scheme could not continue.
It began at the start of the 2013 school year, with £14m funding from OFMDFM topped up with £2m from the Department of Education.
Schools where some pupils were struggling to reach basic standards in English and Maths were provided with an extra member of staff.
Only newly-qualified teachers could apply for the new two-year posts.
Holy Cross Boys Primary School in north Belfast was among the schools to benefit from the scheme, gaining one new teacher.
Vice-Principal Chris Donnelly said that this had made a big difference.
""In this school two years ago, we had 68% of our children at level four in Maths and English at the end of Primary Seven,"" he said.
""After one year of signature, we went up to 74% and this year we are recording 80%, which is a significant leap.""
Level Four is the Northern Ireland average for Maths and English at the end of Primary Seven.
Gerard Wallace is the signature teacher employed at Holy Cross since 2013, and he now faces losing his job at the end of the school year.
""I'm extremely worried about getting a job afterwards, not because I haven't got the skills, simply because the jobs aren't there for newly-qualified teachers and those as fresh as I am,"" he said.
A recent review found that 69% of post-primary schools which had received help under the scheme showed an improvement in the numbers of pupils achieving five or more GCSEs at grades A* - C.
In supported primary schools over three-quarters of pupils on average reached level four or above in English and Maths.
Principals called for the scheme to be extended, but the Education Minister John O'Dowd said he did not have the money as his department faced ""one of the most challenging financial environments in decades"".
He said, however, that the programme was leaving ""an important legacy, clearly demonstrating improved attainment, and enabling our most deprived children to remain in education"".",A scheme which gave extra staff to schools and two years' work to newly-qualified teachers is not being renewed due to a lack of ongoing funding.,32990909
"The move came amid tension and violence after the shooting of a Jewish activist. Israel's PM urged calm, saying Mr Abbas was stoking unrest.
The holy site will reopen on Friday, Israel's economy minister says.
Yehuda Glick, a campaigner for greater Jewish prayer rights at the Temple Mount/al-Haram al-Sharif, was wounded.
Israeli police later killed a Palestinian suspected of shooting him. Moataz Hejazi, 32, was shot after reportedly opening fire when police surrounded his home.
Rabbi Glick is a well-known US-born campaigner for the right of Jews to pray at the site, which is currently prohibited.
The compound - known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif - is the holiest site in Judaism, and contains the al-Aqsa Mosque - the third holiest site in Islam.
In other developments
Angry crowds gathered in Arab East Jerusalem near Hejazi's home as news spread that he had been shot.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against stone-throwing youths.
Analysis: BBC's Kevin Connolly in Jerusalem
A delicate status quo governs rights of access to al-Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount. Israel captured the Old City in 1967 but swiftly handed control of the compound back to the Islamic religious authorities, fearful of triggering a Holy War. Israel's security forces do impose restrictions - banning men under the age of 50 from worshipping on occasion - but argue that is about maintaining order.
Jews are allowed to visit the site but not to pray there. Now some right-wing religious groups say Jews should be allowed to pray - a demand which causes anger and unease in the Muslim world.
If it all sounds familiar, well that is because it is. When Britain governed the Holy Land in 1929 a very similar dispute provoked rioting that led to widespread loss of life - a proper resolution of it all still feels hopelessly distant.
There was also a small demonstration by far-right Israelis outside the holy site, with several arrested for attempting to enter it.
Palestinians hold the Israeli government responsible for a ""dangerous act"", Mr Abbas was quoted as saying by spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeina, AFP reports.
Israeli Economy Minister Naftali Bennett told the BBC on Thursday that the holy site would reopen in time for Friday prayers ""unless there are unusual events that take place over the next few hours"".
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called for calm, suggesting Mr Abbas is responsible for the increasing tension.
""We're facing a wave of incitement by radical Islamic elements as well as by the Palestinian Authority chairman... who said that Jews must absolutely be prevented from going on to the Temple Mount,"" he said, quoted by Haaretz newspaper.
Some districts of East Jerusalem have seen nightly clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces since the Gaza conflict last summer.

Coventry City Council had said there was ""no budget"" for a 2016 event after last year's cost the taxpayer Â£314,000.
But the authority announced it would go ahead once more, saying the 2015 festival gave Coventry an economic boost of about Â£1.7m.

The event, which attracted 141,000 people over three days last year, includes comedy, a funfair and family entertainment.
Last year's headliners included the Fun Lovin' Criminals, The Wombats, Embrace and JME.
The council had called for sponsors to allow the festival to continue to be free for another year.
It said it hoped to showcase its cultural and arts scene as it builds its bid to become the UK City of Culture in 2021.
Cllr Abdul Khan, Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Events, said: ""People will have seen there has been some debate and questions as to whether the event should continue due to the budget pressures we are facing as a council.
""However, we are really proud of the fact that Coventry Godiva Festival remains the biggest free family festival in the UK.""
The headline acts will be announced in the coming weeks, he said.
I stood in the main field at Coventry's War Memorial Park during last year's Godiva Festival and the councillor in charge of events at the city council cast serious doubt over its future.

The council's ultimate aim is to fund the entire cost via sponsorship in the future.
But, when pushed, they couldn't guarantee the festival will run every year.

"However, the Texan company said its UK operations will be a priority area, as it cuts back more harshly on North American onshore projects.
After the crash in the oil price, the firm is allocating between $1.4bn and $1.8bn to capital expenditure in 2016.
That is a drop of more than half on last year.
In 2015 it spent $3.6bn. It is also a cut more than 80% on its 2014 budget.
It is to be split in roughly equal portions between maintenance, development and exploration.
Its North Sea operations are to get 30%, the largest share of any of the company's regional operations. Offshore Egypt is also to be a priority.
The decision runs counter to fears that the North Sea is seen by the industry worldwide as a relatively expensive and unattractive oil and gas basin in which to invest.
Apache's North Sea assets produce at below the average cost for the region, an average of $16 per barrel of oil by the end of 2015. That is more than its Egyptian and North American assets, but so is the UK cash margin, at $33 per barrel last year.
In addition, the company has been unusually successful with recent drilling. Last October, the Houston-based explorer announced several new finds, which will be the focus of the new capital spending.
Two are in the Beryl area, east of Orkney, and one near the Forties field, which lies east of Fraserburgh.
Together, the Callater, Corona and Seagull finds are estimated to have reserves of between 74 and 129 million barrels of oil or its gas equivalent.
The company reported that it drilled 23 development wells in the UK North Sea during 2015, with an overall success rate of 83%. In the final quarter, its North Sea production averaged 72,000 barrels per day.
Across all its operations, Apache suffered a pre-tax loss of $28 billion in 2015. That was mainly explained by a $25 billion drop in the valuation of its oil and gas reserves due to lower prices.","Apache, a long-established operator in the North Sea oil industry, is to slash its capital spending this year by more than half.",35673605

The Scottish club's vote to change its rules and allow women fell short of the required two-thirds majority.
Governing body the R&A responded with its ban on Muirfield hosting The Open until the club changed its rules.
""It's more of a loss to Muirfield than it is to us,"" said McIlroy, 27.
The world number three added: ""It's not right to host the world's biggest tournament at a place that does not allow women to be members. Hopefully Muirfield can see some sense and we can get it back on The Open rota.""

McIlroy's view was echoed by Gary Player, who has won nine majors, including The Open at Muirfield in 1959.
""As much as I love and respect Muirfield as a club where I won The Open, I totally agree with the R&A,"" said the South African. ""Staging the championship at any venue that does not admit women is simply unacceptable.""
In announcing the club's decision, Muirfield captain Henry Fairweather stressed that women will continue to be welcome at the East Lothian club as guests and visitors, ""as they have been for many years"".
Veteran BBC golf commentator Peter Alliss said women who want to play at Muirfield should ""marry a member"" in order to play.
He also said he had spoken to the wives of Muirfield members and claimed there was ""a look of horror"" on their faces when he suggested they might be able to become members in their own right.
He reckoned they did not want to become members because they would have to start paying for something they currently got for free.

""The women who are there as wives of husbands, they get all the facilities,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live. ""If somebody wants to join, well you'd better get married to somebody who's a member.""
Alliss, 85, said he understood why members had failed to vote in large enough numbers to overturn the ban on women members.
""Clubs were formed years ago by people of like spirit - doctors, lawyers, accountants, bakers, butchers - and they joined in like spirit to talk amongst themselves and do whatever,"" he said.
""I want to join the Women's Voluntary Service, but unless I have pieces snipped away from my whatever, I'm not going to be able to get in.""
Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Muirfield's stance was ""simply indefensible"", while Women's Open winner Catriona Matthew said she was ""embarrassed to be a Scottish women golfer from East Lothian"".
Ivan Khodabakhsh, chief executive of the Ladies' European Tour, said Muirfield's decision had left him ""speechless"".
Speaking to Radio 5 Live's Breakfast programme, he said: ""The decision is appalling. We are in the 21st century and we are talking about criteria which discriminate based on gender.
""I thought these things were left behind us in the late 19th century.""
Like McIlroy, Europe's Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke - a former Open winner - said he hoped Muirfield would rethink its decision.
""Muirfield have chosen to go their path - and fair play to them - but from a professional golfer's point of view it's disappointing that we will not be playing Muirfield in the foreseeable future,"" he said.
Graeme McDowell said he was ""disappointed"" with Muirfeld's stance.
""I completely understand the R&A's decision,"" he said. ""This is an equal opportunity world, we're trying to grow the game.

Murray, seeded third, won 6-2 6-2 1-6 6-1 to set up a fourth-round match with Croatian 23rd seed Ivo Karlovic.
There were worrying moments for the 2013 champion as he failed to win a game for 40 minutes and had treatment to his shoulder in the fourth set.
But having lost six games in a row, Murray, 28, swept through the last six.
Asked about the shoulder issue, Murray said: ""It's something I had the last two, three days. I only really feel it when I'm serving but it's not something that's of major concern to me.
""It's stiffness and every time I finish a practice or anything, I have my back manipulated.
""The physio came on the court and said it was like a machine gun going off when he laid on top of me. Literally my back cracked a lot. That's been the case for the last few days.""
Murray had won his last six matches against 25th seed Seppi and appeared on course for another straightforward win when he led by two sets after little over an hour.
With all areas of his game working smoothly, the Scot was in complete control thanks to four breaks of serve, only for two medical timeouts to shift the momentum.
It was Seppi, 31, who first called the trainer to work on his ankle, and the break in play had a major effect on both men, with Murray double-faulting twice on the resumption to drop serve.
An unexpected lapse threatened to become something more serious when Murray dropped serve again, clutching his shoulder, and Seppi then broke at the start of the third set as his opponent screamed ""Useless!"" at his own efforts.
The British number one was now in real trouble, requiring an intensive bout of treatment to his shoulder at the changeover, but once again the break in play benefited the injured party.
Urged on by a now fired-up Centre Court crowd, Murray resumed with the positive intent of his early play and recovered the break to end a 40-minute period without winning a game.
The world number three dominated the closing stages, clambering all over the Seppi serve as he broke three times to secure victory in two hours and eight minutes.
Murray confirmed that Seppi's medical time-out had contributed to his shoulder problem, saying: ""Obviously when you do take a break, it does stiffen up and my serve was pretty bad after that happened.
""Once I had the treatment, I served much better.""
Seppi said he had called the trainer because his ankle hurt and joked that the physio had brought both men good fortune.

"John Ranson says he slammed the door on the first intruder, threw the hot tea at the eyes of the second and targeted the third with his empty mug.
Police are still looking for the trio, one of whom reportedly had a gun.
The incident happened in Siggiewi, a rural area where Mr Ranson has lived 10 out of his 26 years in Malta.
""I usually wake up early, between 05:00 and 06:00,"" he told the BBC.
""I made a mug of tea and was going through the garage when I saw a foot behind the door.""
At first, Mr Ranson said, he thought it was the pool man, even though it was not his day. Then he spotted the other two intruders.
""They were all wearing balaclavas and one of them had a gun. I thought: 'This is for real'.""
After chasing them off, he started shouting ""many names"", he said, as if others were in the house. But it was just himself and his wife.

"Northamptonshire County Council installed the ""visibility screen"" at the Danes Camp Way roundabout, in the hope it would slow down vehicles.
Some people told BBC Northampton's Facebook page it was ""dangerous"" while others backed the move.
Motoring group the AA said, drivers would have to be ""pretty stupid"" not to slow down at the roundabout.
But Paul Watters, head of road policing at the AA, said alternative options may have been better.
""It's a compromise solution,"" he said.
""Traffic lights or realigning the approach roads to make the traffic slower would be other, more expensive, options.""

"Children are being used as porters, guards, informers and fighters and, in some cases, as human shields, the charity said in Childhood Under Fire.
Some two million children are in need of assistance in Syria, Save the Children estimates.
It says the two-year conflict has affected all aspects of their lives.
Researchers from Turkey found that three in every four Syrian children they interviewed had lost a loved one because of the fighting, the report says.
Many have lost access to healthcare and are living in unsanitary conditions where the risk of disease is high. Their families are struggling for food as shortages send prices beyond the reach of poorer families.
Their education has been disrupted as some 2,000 schools have either been damaged by the fighting or become temporary shelters for displaced people.
Syria's children are the conflict's ""forgotten victims -  facing death, trauma and suffering, and deprived of basic humanitarian aid"", the report said.
Save the Children has appealed for international help, but said: ""The only way to stop their suffering is to bring an end to the war.""
The report said it had found a growing pattern of children under the age of 18 being used by armed groups on both sides in the conflict.
For many children and their families, it is seen as a source of pride, the report says, but some children are being forcibly recruited into military activities.
In some cases, children as young as eight have been used as human shields, the report says.
One group affiliated to the opposition has documented the deaths of at least 17 children associated with armed groups since the start of the conflict; many others have been severely injured and in some cases permanently disabled, the report also says.
The research team at Bahcesehir University in Turkey found that not only had three in every four children they spoke to had lost a loved one, but one in every three children had been hit, kicked or shot at in the course of the conflict.
""I don't think there is a single child untouched by this war,"" the report quotes a child called Safa as saying. ""Everyone has seen death, everyone has lost someone. I know no one who has not suffered as we have. It is on such a scale.""
The Save the Children report echoes similar findings made public by the UN children's agency Unicef on Tuesday.
Unicef warned of a lost generation in Syria, saying children under the age of 18 were growing up knowing nothing but violence, were being deprived of a right to an education and were suffering traumas that could scar them for life.
As many as 70,000 people have died in the two-year conflict, the UN believes.

"Chair Paul Thomas and vice-chair Adele Baumgardt have been suspended after a review found a ""significant breakdown"" in relations at senior level.
Mr Thomas lost a vote of no confidence from the Sport Wales board after he reported members were paid too much.
Mr Thorburn, a former board member, said the organisation should be run by people who understand sport.
Sport Wales is given around Â£20m of public funds every year to promote sport in Wales from elite level to grassroots activity.
The activities of its board were suspended in November amid concerns that the organisation had become dysfunctional under the chairmanship of business expert Mr Thomas.
A critical review he commissioned - not published but seen by the BBC - had called for an overhaul of Sport Wales, saying it ""lacks transparency"", was ""obsolete in its thinking"" and ""weak in vision"".
On Tuesday, Public Health Minister Rebecca Evans told the Senedd that the board was being reinstated under an interim chairman while Mr Thomas and Ms Baumgardt were suspended pending further inquiries.
Mr Thorburn, who served on the Sport Wales board under its previous chair Laura McAllister, denied suggestions that the organisation had not been transparent and gave too much priority to elite sport.
He told BBC Radio Wales:  ""A degree of frustration from my perspective is that our Welsh ministers don't seem to value sport in society.
""We were trying to get sport and physical literacy on the curriculum, driving that hard and trying to get that forced through but we seem to be stumbling at every hurdle.
""So I think politicians need to be very careful.""
Mr Thorburn welcomed the appointment of an interim chairman and re-instatement of the board, allowing Sport Wales officials to fully resume their activities.
But he urged ministers not to take too much control over the organisation.
""You need people who understand sport, understand the value of sport in society and, unfortunately, in my opinion some of the ministers we've had in place clearly don't,"" he said.
The Welsh Government declined to respond to Mr Thorburn's comments.
Meanwhile Alun Ffred Jones, a former Plaid Cymru AM and minister responsible for sport, said the situation was ""a bit of a mess"".
He criticised Ms Evans for refusing to reveal full details of the government review on grounds of data protection and confidentiality.
""You either have a report or you don't,"" he told BBC Radio Cymru.

"It is the girls' first return home since they were kidnapped from their school in Chibok in April 2014.
The young women were freed in October after Switzerland and the International Red Cross made a deal with Boko Haram.
Since then, the 21 girls have been held in a secret location for debriefing by the Nigerian government.
One of the girls, Asabe Goni, 22, told Reuters news agency it was a ""miracle"" that she was home again.
Helping her mother prepare for Christmas, she said she was excited to go to church on Christmas Day.
""I never knew that I would return (home),"" she said simply. ""I had given up hope of ever going home.""
Of the 276 students kidnapped, 197 are still reportedly missing, and negotiations for their release are under way.
Many of the Chibok girls were Christian, but were encouraged to convert to Islam and to marry their kidnappers during their time in captivity.
Ms Goni said some were whipped for refusing to marry, but otherwise they were well treated and fed, until food supplies recently ran short.
After the deal in October, the girls' captors announced that any girl who wanted to be released should line up.
Ms Goni was ill and too exhausted to move as the others scrambled into formation - but she soon learned she would be among the lucky few to leave.
Who are Boko Haram?

""I was surprised when they announced that my name was on the list,"" she said.
Her joy was lessened, however, when she was forced to leave behind her cousin Margaret, with whom she had lived since childhood.
The young woman was interviewed at her family's home in the northern city of Yola, surrounded by her father, stepmother, five siblings, and several neighbours.
""Some of the other girls left behind started crying,"" Ms Goni said. ""But the Boko Haram men consoled them, telling them that their turn to go home would come one day.""
Before the girls' release, there had only been one confirmed release of a student kidnapped from Chibok.
On 24 December, Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari said the army had driven Boko Haram's militants from the last camp in their Sambisa forest stronghold.
""The terrorists are on the run and no longer have a place to hide,"" Mr Buhari said in a statement.
The army has been engaged for the last few weeks in a major offensive in the forest, a huge former colonial game reserve in north-eastern Borno state.
There has been speculation that some of the Chibok girls are being held in the forest, after it was named by a small number of those who escaped.
Mr Buhari said that efforts to find the remaining girls were being intensified.

"The central government has already approved the reef dumping plan, which is linked to a major port expansion.
But the decision has proved hugely controversial, prompting stringent criticism from environmentalists.
The Queensland government said its plan to dispose of the sediment on land would ""create a win-win situation"".
""It will protect the unique values of the Great Barrier Reef and allow for the staged development of the important port of Abbot Point,"" State Premier Campbell Newman said in a statement.
Several companies want to use the Abbot Point port to export coal reserves from the Galilee Basin area in central Queensland. Late last year, the government approved an application for the coal terminal to be expanded.
Dredging is needed to allow bigger ships into the port, and earlier this year a plan to dump three million cubic metres of dredged sediment in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park area was approved.
But scientists have warned the sediment could smother or poison coral, further damaging a reef already hit by climate change and other factors. The plan was also facing a legal challenge from a Queensland environmental group.
The Queensland government said that under its proposal, the dredged material could be dumped onshore at an existing site within the Abbot Point State Development Area.
The state government would now apply to the federal government for permission to dispose of the dredged material on land, it said.
""We will now ask Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt to fast-track approval of our strategy under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 to ensure dredging for the expansion of Abbot Point can begin on schedule,"" Minister for State Development and Planning Jeff Seeney said.
Dredging is due to begin in 2015.
The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral structure, rich in marine life.
It is a Unesco-listed World Heritage Site, but in recent years the UN body has warned that it could be put on its World Heritage in Danger list because of its worsening condition.
In August, a five-yearly report by the marine park authority said that the outlook for the reef was poor despite conservation efforts, with further deterioration expected in coming years.
Climate change remained the biggest threat to the site, the report said, but poor water quality from land-based run-off, coastal development and fishing also posed challenges.",The Queensland government has proposed a plan that would prevent sediment being dumped in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.,29105613

Mr Neumark said he ""couldn't think of a better set of owners"" to run the firm he started 23 years ago.

"Although the 6,833 houses and flats completed is slightly down on the previous year, it is the second highest figure in nine years.
It includes 1,243 social and council homes, according to Welsh Government figures, which are based on National Housing Building Council returns.
This is the second highest number of new homes for social and housing association landlords since 1998-99.
Newport and the Vale of Glamorgan are where the largest numbers of houses were built in 2016-17. Cardiff had the largest number of flats - nearly a third of the total completed in Wales.
The Federation of Master Builders (FMB), in its programme for government, has called for 14,000 new homes a year to be built in Wales over the next five years.
But it said the figures on Wednesday showed ""a lot of room for improvement"" and believes smaller building firms should be brought into the mix more, particularly those parts of Wales less attractive to the big house builders.
Ifan Glyn, director of FMB Cymru, said: ""Around 75% of homes in Wales are now built by five big companies. House building on small parcels of land needs to be made more attractive to small and medium sized construction companies, who are at the moment working on things like house extensions.""
The FMB wants small building firms brought into the local development plan process and for an end to social housing stipulations for small private developments.
Community Housing Cymru, which represents the social housing sector, welcomed the figures.
With the Welsh Government and Welsh Local Government Association, it set a target last year for 20,000 affordable homes to be built by 2021, including 12,500 by housing associations.

"Michael Smithyman was given two life sentences for the violent murders carried out in Kent in January 1990.
He said he also knew who started the New Cross fire, in which 13 died.
A source told BBC South East Met Police detectives were told to halt their inquiries into all the claims. The force said reviews found no evidence.
Smithyman pleaded guilty to the murders of his girlfriend April Sheridan and Terence Gayle.
Ms Sheridan was 22 years old and the mother of his child when he shot and murdered her using a sawn-off shotgun in Meopham, Kent.
The murder of Mr Gayle was a contract killing in which Smithyman was paid Â£3,000. His body was also disposed of in Kent.
Documents seen by BBC South East Today detail conversations Smithyman had with Metropolitan Police detectives in 1991.
They show he made a catalogue of confessions detailing his alleged involvement in scores of serious violent crimes, including a significant number of murders.
The source - who agreed to be interviewed by the BBC on the grounds that his identity was protected - heard the confessions.
""He was talking about murder on more than one occasion... these are still listed as crimes that have never been solved and there must be a lot of people who will be looking for justice,"" he said.
Smithyman also spoke about being present when a fire which killed 13 black youngsters at a birthday party was started in New Cross, south east London, on 18 January 1981.
No-one has ever been convicted over the blaze.
Smithyman told detectives in 1991 he saw people trapped in the flames, and it had been started by a criminal associate who petrol bombed the house as a reprisal for being refused entry.
The Metropolitan Police said ""extensive investigations"" were carried out into the New Cross fire claims.
However, the BBC discovered the team of detectives investigating all of Smithyman's confessions were abruptly ordered to halt their inquiries.
The BBC's source said the investigating officer later told him that ""his career was in jeopardy unless he did exactly what he was told.""
In 1991 a small team of Met Police detectives were given the task to investigate Smithyman's claims.
We understand they spent many months carrying out inquiries and were taking the confessions very seriously, creating separate dossiers for each crime.  But after more than a year's worth of work a decision was taken to halt the inquiries.
When the investigation team disbanded there was frustration and disappointment amongst some of the officers.
The confessions left many at the time baffled, not least some highly experienced Met detectives - some of whom feared there may be some truth in Smithyman's boasts.
Smithyman, who is now 50, now lives as a woman in prison, and is now known as Michelle.
In correspondence via her solicitor, she now denies committing four of the murders she had previously confessed to being involved with.
She also asserts she was not present when the New Cross fire started.
With regards to the other crimes she said she was either serving a jail sentence at the time of the alleged offence, served sentences in respect of them, or has no recollection of the confessions taking place in 1991.
In a statement, the Met Police said it had spoken to the retired officer who oversaw the investigation.
""He states it was closed after a thorough investigation meant there were no further meaningful lines of enquiry.
""A number of reviews and follow-up inquiries have been conducted over the years into claims made by this person, and no evidence has been found.
""Any new and genuine information will be thoroughly assessed by the Met.""","A convicted double killer confessed to scores of other crimes including 12 murders which, it is claimed, were not fully investigated, the BBC has learnt.",34712868
"Both will be in contention to feature for the Ports in Saturday's Irish Cup game at Loughgall.
Dolan, 28, has had spells at several Irish League clubs including Ballymena United, Carrick Rangers, Ards and Warrenpoint Town.
Duffin, 24, was on Cliftonville's books for four years before moving to their neighbours Crusaders in 2014.
Ports manager Niall Currie signed the duo just before the transfer window closed on Tuesday night.
Dolan played under Currie during his stint at Ards and the Ports boss believes he will be a good acquisition for the Shamrock Park outfit.

"The Zouk superclub, a local institution, has said the incident was ""a misunderstanding"", but it has triggered a flood of angry comments online, with many siding with Egyptian trance DJ Fadi Wassef Naguib, who accused the club of favouritism.
It also underscored unease in the city-state about a possible spill over of the political scandal engulfing its neighbour.
The row began after DJ Fila, one half of trance music duo Aly and Fila, ended his headline set at Zouk on Saturday night by saying he had been told to make way for ""the son of a prime minister"".
He told the crowd he was ""insulted"" and would never play the club again.
Zouk has not confirmed that Norashman Najib was on the decks, but three people who were at the club told the BBC they saw him perform.
They said the club emptied out when he took over the decks.
An aide to the family of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak was quoted as saying Mr Norashman was invited to play, and did not force DJ Fila to stop performing.
""Taking into account that it was an acknowledgment of his talent and hobby, Ashman agreed to do the performance,"" the aide was quoted as saying by news portal Malaysiakini., using his nickname.
Zouk said on Monday it was a ""misunderstanding"" and DJ Fila was ""not at any point of time asked to end his set prematurely before the contracted set end time of 3.30am"".
But that has not stopped Singaporean club-goers and his fans from flooding Zouk's Facebook page with complaints.
""Music is an escape, something that unites people, a zone where it should be politics free,"" said one user.
Singaporean Henry Soh, who attended the gig, told the BBC: ""This is Singapore, not Malaysia... In Singapore we do not abuse our power or authority, whether or not one is a local or not a local.""
Part of the unhappiness has to do with the complicated relationship Singapore has with Malaysia, and how Singaporeans view the political scandals that sporadically erupt across the border.
Singapore prides itself on its squeaky clean and stable image, a contrast with the image of its neighbour, even as it maintains close ties with Mr Najib and his government.
Though he has officially been cleared of wrongdoing, Mr Najib is facing mounting opposition at home amid accusations of corruption connected to the 1MDB state fund, and links to Singapore have emerged.
Singapore authorities have seized 1MDB-linked bank accounts in a money laundering investigation, while a local banker has emerged as a key figure in the probe.
The Zouk case appears to have reinforced worries that Singapore is not immune from Malaysian-style politics.
Some fans have noted that Zouk was recently purchased by an arm of Malaysian conglomerate Genting.
Genting is one of several companies named by Swiss prosecutors in connection with a criminal investigation into two former officials of 1MDB suspected of bribery.
""Zouk is now under Genting group... Of course now their PR and management... is 'Malaysia Boleh',"" said one Facebook user, using a popular pro-Malaysia slogan.
Said another person: ""This is Singapore! Not Najib-sia, we don't have to be subservient to the royal Najib family.""

"Staff were evacuated from the building in the Media Park in the city of Hilversum.
The man, smartly dressed and carrying what appeared to be a long pistol, paced around a studio, reportedly demanding airtime.
Armed police then stormed into the studio and overpowered him.
Prosecutors later said that the man, aged 19 and from the town of Pijnacker near The Hague, was in police custody.
He is being held on suspicion of making a threat, weapons possession and taking a hostage, officials added.
Police combed the building, declaring it safe shortly after 22:00 (21:00 GMT).
Justice and Safety Minister Ivo Opstelten said it appeared that the man had been acting on his own.
During the disruption to the NOS news programme, the channel broadcast a message reading: ""In connection with circumstances, no broadcast is available at this time.""
The man's motive was unclear. Dutch media reported that he was believed to be a student at a technical university and had been living with his mother and stepfather.
The NOS footage shows him saying: ""The things that are going to be said [pause] - those are very large world affairs. We were hired by the security service.""
A threatening letter the man allegedly gave to staff, warning of bomb and cyber attacks if he was prevented from going on air, has been published on the NOS website (in Dutch).
A reporter who spoke to him said he had claimed to be from a ""hackers' collective"", AP news agency says.
When the channel came back on the air, it broadcast video of the man wandering about a studio.
According to NOS director Jan de Jong, he had wanted to go to the main evening news studio but instead a guard took him to a studio where daytime bulletins are broadcast.
Dressed in a black suit, white shirt and black tie, and carrying what appeared to be a long black pistol, he can be seen on the video walking around in the studio, which appears to be empty.
Armed police then storm in, shouting: ""Drop it! Drop it! Get on your knees!""
He drops the gun, saying: ""I dropped it. It's dropped.""

You're not going to give up things you've worked very very hard for without a fight
Outgoing UK Athletics chief Ed Warner said on Friday that he would back those plans if they were for ""the good of the sport"".
But Radcliffe says that would be ""punishing athletes twice"".
Speaking to BBC Breakfast following Warner's comments, the 43-year-old added: ""You should never throw away the history and what the sport is built on"".
""They [European Athletics] say you would be listed as a 'former record holder' and, for me, you become a former record holder when someone beats your time, not because the administrators decide to make it like that.""
Radcliffe set the world record at the London Marathon in 2003 in a time of two hours 15 minutes 25 seconds.
""You're not going to give up things you've worked very very hard for without a fight, just in the name of it being for the good of the sport. I've had to race athletes cheating and then to lose records because of athletes who chose to cheat.""
In January European Athletics set up a taskforce to look into the credibility of world records. The ruling council has now ratified the proposals put forward by the taskforce, and it wants the sport's world governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), to adopt the changes it sets out.
One key proposal is that blood samples must be stored for 10 years after a record is set.
The IAAF has stored blood and urine samples only since 2005 and current records that do not meet the new criteria would remain on an ""all-time list"", but not be officially recognised as records.
This would also include Jonathan Edwards' triple jump record of 18.29m at the World Championships in 1995.

In footage shot on a mobile phone he is heard saying ""I can't breathe"" as he was restrained by police.
He became unresponsive and later died.
Officer Daniel Pantaleo, 29, who has been on the force for eight years, appeared before a grand jury last month testifying that he did not intend to choke Mr Garner.
He described the manoeuvre as a takedown move and said that he never thought Mr Garner was in danger.

Several officers move to restrain Mr Garner, who is asthmatic, with Mr Pantaleo holding him by the neck.

"Peter Morgan, 54, of Llanellen, Monmouthshire, is accused of strangling Georgina Symonds, 25, in January.
The father-of-two admits killing Miss Symonds but denies murder.
Newport Crown Court was told Mr Morgan had visits from call girls at his family home before meeting Miss Symonds.
He continued to see other women despite paying her £10,000 a month to work as his exclusive escort, the trial heard.
Dr Ajat Sanikop, a mental disorder expert who interviewed Mr Morgan after he admitted strangling Miss Symonds, said the millionaire began paying for sex in 2011.
He said: ""[Mr] Morgan began using such services after he was showed how to use his iPhone for various things.
""He met Georgina a year later but he continued to use escort services. She had no major objections to him seeing other escorts.
""Then, in April 2015, his marriage broke down when his wife, Helen, came to be aware about him bringing escorts to the marital home.""
Dr Sanikop also said Mr Morgan told him Miss Symonds was only in a relationship with him for money, but he was in love with her regardless.
He added: ""I think he was quite clear that Georgina was with him because of the money and the lifestyle he gave her.
""But he said he loved her. He was quite aware that as long as he paid her she would stay with him, and if he stopped she wouldn't.
""He described it as a relationship, but it's difficult to classify it as one.""
The court was previously told Mr Morgan strangled Miss Symonds at her home in his castle grounds in Llanmartin after hearing she planned to leave him and hid her body in farm buildings behind his family home.
He denies murder, saying he was suffering from diminished responsibility due to Asperger's syndrome.
Clinical psychologist Prof Simon Baron-Cohen said he was ""in no doubt"" that Mr Morgan had Asperger's syndrome.
He said Mr Morgan suffered from a ""black-and-white"" mindset which affected his decision-making in dealing with Miss Symonds.
""His accounts of his social relationships are not that of a typical person,"" he said.

"Mr Mundell visited Peterhead fish market and spoke to fishermen and processors.
He told them that the UK government would do everything possible to protect the interests of the industry during Brexit talks.
Mr Mundell will later visit Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce.
Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, said: ""I'm glad the secretary of state has chosen to visit Peterhead to hear for himself the opinions of individual fishermen and processors on the fantastic sea of opportunity that Brexit presents for this industry, which is so important to our coastal communities.
""The general election delivered a powerful message from those communities to both the UK and Scottish governments that we have to get out of the CFP (Common Fisheries Policy).
""It's clear that the message is being received by politicians and we now need them to deliver in the forthcoming Brexit negotiations on the restoration of control of our seas so that we can manage this sustainable natural resource in a practicable manner for the future.""

"It is likely Fine Gael will remain the largest party, but with a narrow lead over the main opposition, Fianna Fáil.
Just over a third of the seats for the Dáil (Irish parliament) have been filled.
Polls show Sinn Féin, smaller parties and Independents are also doing well.
Mr Kenny, Labour Party leader Joan Burton and Sinn Féin deputy leader Mary-Lou McDonald have all retained their seats.
However, Fine Gael's former justice minister Alan Shatter and Alex White, the Labour Party's communications minister, have not been returned to parliament.
Mr Kenny said the voting showed that the existing government will not regain power.
""This is a disappointment for the Fine Gael party,"" he said. ""Obviously whether you can argue about the people's decision, you cannot argue with it.
""So clearly, the government of Fine Gael and Labour are not going to be returned to office.""
He added that the ""majority government option is gone"" but he will wait for the full results and consider options on how to form a government ""very carefully"".
""Clearly the country needs a government and must have one,"" he said.
Joan Burton said she was ""very, very disappointed"" that many Labour Party candidates would not be elected to parliament.
""All I can say is that the Labour Party is at the fight for justice and social justice in Ireland and we will continue that fight in the next Dáil, even if our numbers are diminished.""
When asked about how a government will be formed, she said that all parliamentary members would have to ""work to do whatever is best for the people of our country"".
Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin described the election as an ""extraordinary vote"" and said he was ""very pleased"".
""A lot will depend on the destination of the last seats in many constituencies, it's a bit too early to be definitive, but it's clear we're going to have a good day,"" he said.
Sinn Féin deputy leader Mary-Lou McDonald said that she expects the party will be putting leader Gerry Adams forward to be the next taoiseach.
""It's early in the day but I think if this election demonstrates anything, it is that there is now, or should be, no sense from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil that they have some divine right to govern - they don't,"" she said
Many believe the expected result could make negotiations on forming a new government extremely difficult.
Both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil had indicated that they would not go into coalition with each other.
However, pressure is expected to mount on them to come to some form of arrangement that may take several weeks to arrive at.
If borne out by the count, the vote shares would result in a hung Dáil (parliament), but with Fine Gael still taking the largest number of seats.
Over three million people were entitled to vote in Friday's poll, that will return 157 members of parliament, known as TDs. The ceann comhairle (speaker) is automatically returned.
Although the election count is a long and gruelling process, there have been some lighter moments including a silver eternity ring that was found in a ballot box and one voter who gave his number one to UFC champion Conor McGregor.
Meanwhile, one person swapped the Oscars in Hollywood for a count centre in County Cavan in order to support a politician.
Eamon Farrell, the brother of actor Colin Farrell, had a ticket for the star-studded ceremony but decided instead to travel to the count centre in order to show his backing for Arts Minister Heather Humphries.
The election campaign was fought mainly over economic issues, with the government parties asking voters for their support to keep the recovery going at a time when international storm clouds are gathering.
But the opposition parties countered that not everyone, especially outside of middle-class Dublin, is yet benefiting from the up-turn.
The Republic of Ireland has had the biggest growing economy in the eurozone for the last two years.
TDs will be elected according to the single transferable vote (STV) system, in which candidates have to reach a quota, before their surplus votes are distributed to others.",Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Enda Kenny has conceded that the existing Fine Gael-Labour coalition government will not be returned in the Republic of Ireland general election.,35674465
"The figures point to a sharp drop in the number of new firms operating in the oil and gas sector.
That energy category, known to statisticians as ""mining and quarrying"", dropped from 215 to 99 start-up businesses.
The total number of start-ups, compiled by the four main banks in the Scottish market, was down 1%, to 11,669.
The Committee of Scottish Bankers reported a 2% drop in the final quarter, compared with the last three months of 2014.
By region, Aberdeen city and Aberdeenshire saw a drop in new companies from 1539 to 1382.
The east of Scotland was the only other region to report a fall, from  3139 to 2956.
Measured by council area, Edinburgh saw a fall but it was Glasgow that stood out for a significant drop compared with 2014 - down from 1468 to 1,330 new firms.
The decline of urban start-ups registered in these statistics may be partly explained by growing competition for business banking from lenders with a smaller presence in the Scottish market.
The Committee of Scottish Bankers includes Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Scotland, Clydesdale and TSB.  It does not include HSBC, Barclays or Nationwide.
According to the four main Scottish-based banks, most regions of Scotland saw a small increase in start-up business, except in the south of Scotland, where new firms registered by the bankers were up from 477 to 600.
One of the biggest business categories, recreation and personal services, fell from 1686 to 1382.
Adding most new firms was the real estate sector, rising from 3,186 to 3,371 start-up accounts.

"The growth rate slowed to an annual rate of 7.1%, compared with 7.9% in the previous quarter.
It is the slowest growth since the April to June quarter in 2014, when the rate was 6.7%.
Analyst Abhishek Upadhyay of ICICI Securities said growth ""continues to be driven by government spending while private spending remains muted"".
The sharp slowdown in growth could make it more difficult for the government's to reach its target of 8% in the year, although the country retained its claim to be the fastest-growing large economy, ahead of China.
Growth was dragged down in the quarter by a contraction in mining and a sluggish agricultural sector.
""This number is much, much below the market expectation,"" said Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist at India Ratings and Research.
Growth needs to be towards double digits to create the jobs that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to the millions of Indians joining the workforce each year.
Mr Modi has sought to get growth moving by implementing reforms and boosting government spending to offset a lack of private sector investment.
In the summer quarter, the monsoon season should provide some support to growth.
Normal rainfall this summer after two seasons of drought could lift rural consumption by $80bn in the year to the end of March 2017, according to Citibank estimates.

The firm has now said it will shut the depot on 19 November.
The company said ""every effort"" would be made to help those people affected to secure alternative employment.

"Don't take my word for it.
Scotland's first minister has appeared on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, so these choices of words, records and books are hers, not mine.
""My childhood obsession with the wonderful Cilla Black,"" the SNP leader tells Kirsty Young, led to ""the first ever tantrum I remember"".
Her mum and dad had said no when she asked if they would buy her Cilla's new album.
But her ""wonderful grandad"" saved the day and bought it for her instead.
Nicola Sturgeon's desert island choices:
Records:
Book:  Complete Works of Jane Austen
Luxury: Coffee maker, coffee cup and milk
Track to save: My Love is Like a Red, Red Rose.
We learn too that this leader first politicised by Margaret Thatcher - what she describes as ""the sense of hopelessness in the community I was growing up in, being inflicted by a government most in Scotland hadn't voted for"" - is now reading Charles Moore's biography of the former prime minister.
She is fascinated, she explains, by ""the art and science of decision making.""
Nicola Sturgeon is a leader still learning her craft.
She took over as Scotland's first minister in 2014 from Alex Salmond, having served as his deputy.
""Nothing quite prepares you for that first moment when you've got a big decision to make,"" she reflects. ""That feeling in my stomach and the guy next door wasn't there to pass it on to!""
It has been quite an 18 months for Nicola Sturgeon.
From losing Scotland's referendum on independence, which left her ""in floods of tearsâ€¦ totally and utterly devastated"" to the euphoria of this year's general election, where the SNP won every seat in Scotland bar three.
But this was an interview more about what makes Scotland's first minister tick than day-to-day politics.
Her nationalism, her instinct that Scotland would be better off as an independent country, had been shaped, she says, by her grandmother.
Her English grandmother.
""She came from just outside Sunderland and yet had this belief that Scotland should be an independent country,"" the SNP leader says.
Her views had a lasting impression on a young Nicola Sturgeon, in how she perceives nationalism - and how she sees that at odds with how some perceived her during the referendum campaign.
""I detested that sense that what we were arguing for was a rejection of England as a country, or England as a people.""
""It is not about antipathy or hostility towards England,"" she says, and the implication it was ""genuinely upset me.""
How much does it matter to her that she is Scotland's first female first minister?
After all, one of her musical choices was 'Sisters are Doin' it for Themselves' by the Eurythmics and Aretha Franklin.
""This is the song that speaks to the feminist in me,"" she says.
But would a self-styled ""feminist"" give an interview to Vogue, spread over seven pages of the magazine?
""I do struggle a bit with this, I want politics to be accessible. But there is too much focus on what women wear. I am a wee bit contradicted and conflicted on that,"" she admits.
She acknowledged too being left feeling hurt by stories about why she never had children.
""People make assumptions about why, and frankly those people know nothing of the reality of that. The assumption that people sometimes make is that I have made a cold, calculated decision to put my career ahead of having a family, and that is not true,"" she says, adding:
""Sometimes things happen in life, sometimes they don't. I don't have any regrets. If I could turn the clock backâ€¦ I wouldn't want to fundamentally change the path my life has taken.""
Her favourite record of all combines her pride in Scotland and love of her husband, the SNP's chief executive, Peter Murrell.
It is ""My Love is Like a Red, Red Rose"" - by Robert Burns and sung by Eddi Reader.
It was played on their wedding day.
But, of course, on Kirsty Young's mythical desert island, Nicola Sturgeon would be on her own; her husband, a good cook, not there.
""I am not practical in the slightest,"" she said. ""I wouldn't survive a week!""
You can hear Nicola Sturgeon on Desert Island Discs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday from 11:15 GMT.","If you come across Nicola Sturgeon on a desert island, expect to find a ""hot-headed, impulsive"" character, blasting out a Cilla Black record and reading a biography of Lady Thatcher.",34821669

However, she told BBC Scotland it was ""heart-breaking"" her son's fiancee was told to wait 24 hours before reporting him officially missing.
Mrs Nelson had travelled to the Netherlands but has now returned home to Eskbank in Dalkeith as the search for her son continues.
Chris, who lives in Germany, was in Amsterdam with his fiancee Stephanie Kollross to visit their friend.
Mrs Nelson told the BBC Scotland news website: ""I got a few texts from Christopher around about five in the morning. They were a bit worrying.
""He has been a bit homesick lately and he was missing his sisters. Him and Steffy are coming back for Christmas, and he was saying how desperate he was to get back home and see us all again.
""The texts concerned me a little because of the time in the morning.""
Chris told his fiancee he was going for a walk because he could not get to sleep. His family said he would often do this to ""clear his head"".

Chris had planned to tell his sisters Rebecca, 23, and Abbie, 11, that he was going to move back to Scotland in the New Year with his fiancee to try to get work in the oil industry.

"Several famous writers were among his fans, including Philip Roth and Joseph Heller, but he never converted critical acclaim into commercial success.
A former US fighter pilot, he flew in the Korean War alongside future astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who became the second man to walk on the moon.
He died on Friday at a gym near his New York state home, his publisher said.
Salter wrote his first novel, The Hunters, in 1956 during the Korean War and became known for exploring masculine themes like conflict - provoking comparisons to Ernest Hemingway.
Speaking to the BBC in 2013, he said: ""Having been to war satisfies a certain classical definition of manhood. To have seen war is some kind of pillar of manhood, and I felt that at the time.""
The Hunters was made into a Hollywood film in 1958 starring Robert Mitchum but his five later novels received far less attention.

"Katrice Lee vanished in 1981 from a shop at a German military base where her father from Teesside was stationed.
The re-investigation, called Operation Bute, is being carried out by Royal Military Police (RMP).
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) rejected the criticism and said it was pursuing several lines of inquiry.
It was launched four years ago and the girl's father, Richard Lee, of Hartlepool, believes its active status is a means of preventing the family accessing case files and details about previous attempts to find Katrice.
She went missing on 28 November 1981 - her second birthday - in a Naafi shop in Paderborn while out shopping with her mother Sharon, from Gosport, Hampshire.
Additionally, a civilian police review of Operation Bute was completed 14 months ago and Mr Lee said the family had not been informed of its findings.
He said: ""They haven't got my trust. [The MoD] treat my family with contempt.

"Civil servants are currently in control of Stormont's finances because the executive collapsed before agreeing a 2017-18 budget.
James Brokenshire's intervention will, however, stop short of imposing a budget for now.
He will instead reallocate underspends and other money in what is known as a monitoring round.
In a statement, Mr Brokenshire said that having taken advice from civil servants he had concluded it was necessary to ""provide additional clarity... in addressing financial pressures and maintaining public services"".
He will make a written statement to the House of Commons with adjusted indicative budget positions and departmental allocations.
He said these will take account of extra money arising from the UK's spring budget, which has not yet been allocated.
The BBC understands that about £116m will be allocated, including £42m flowing from the spring budget.
Northern Ireland has been without a functioning devolved government since January, when the coalition led by the two biggest parties, the DUP and Sinn Féin, collapsed over a green energy scandal.
Under the current rules, civil servants only have control of 75% of the £10bn block grant.
By the end of July, this will rise to 95% of funds - but they are reluctant to take some spending decisions in the absence of direction from ministers.
The issue of passing a full budget for Northern Ireland from Westminster, in the absence of Stormont, is on hold for now.

The life of legend Nat Lofthouse
Fans gather for Lofthouse funeral
Doreen Miller, 71, of Bolton, was at the 1958 FA Cup final, in which Lofthouse captained the side to a 2-0 victory over Manchester United.
She said she just had to come to pay her respects.
""He was a great ambassador for Bolton. It's been a wonderful turnout for him.""
Former Lancashire rival Jimmy Armfield paid tribute to the ""one club man"".
""He was probably one of the most combative players I have ever played against. He was a great centre-forward.
""You always associated Nat with Bolton. They were two words that went together - Nat and Bolton. You don't need to say his surname do you? You just say Nat.
""He was a great guy and it's a great send-off.""
Former Bolton boss, Sam Allardyce - most recently in charge of Blackburn Rovers - said he had first met Lofthouse as a youngster, but developed a friendship in later life when he returned to the club as a manager.
He said the former England centre-forward was a legend whose death was ""a great loss to his family, Bolton Wanderers and the town"".
Among the turnout was the great and good of Bolton - including the mayor, Councillor John Byrne and other councillors, police and fire chiefs. Fellow Bolton sportsman Amir Khan also attended the service.
A ripple of applause signalled the arrival of the funeral cortege and a guard of honour formed, which included former Bolton players and schoolchildren who had made posters and badges for the occasion.
Bolton manager Owen Coyle and current captain Kevin Davies were among the pall-bearers.
There was a sombre mood inside the church but spirits were lifted as mourners watched a short film about Nat's life, including footage of some of his greatest footballing moments.
In a eulogy, Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) chief Gordon Taylor said: ""It is a great honour and privilege to pay tribute to your hero.
""He would have loved it today. He loved football and he loved Bolton.""
Phil Gartside, Bolton Wanderers chairman, also paid tribute to Bolton's most-loved number-nine.
Lofthouse said to him: ""Nice to meet you cocker, call me Lofty,"" he said.
Mr Gartside said: ""He was a modest man. He had a time for a chat whoever you were, whatever you did.
""He loved to talk about football and his beloved Bolton.""
Perhaps the greatest tribute was the hundreds of people standing by the church doors and by the speakers outside, trying to hear the service.

""I think he would have been really pleased with today.""","Thousands turned out to say goodbye to Nat Lofthouse, from fellow footballing legends to lifelong fans.",12289233
"The Australian finished 0.606 seconds quicker than Lewis Hamilton, who earlier set the pace in first practice.
Hamilton's Mercedes team-mate and championship leader Nico Rosberg was third, a further 0.293secs adrift.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen was fourth, ahead of the Toro Rossos of Daniil Kvyat and Carlos Sainz.
Saturday's qualifying and Sunday's race are live on the BBC sport website and radio 5 live.
The fastest Ferrari was only seventh, in Kimi Raikkonen's hands, ahead of the Force India of Sergio Perez.
Sebastian Vettel was only 14th when he spun at Mirabeau corner, hitting the barrier and damaging the rear wing of his Ferrari.
He later jumped up to ninth only to slide into the barrier at Ste Devote on his very next lap, although he got away without any damage.
Manor's Rio Haryanto was the only other man to crash in a session punctuated by drivers locking wheels and running wide at the first corner and chicane.
The Indonesian, whose long-term future at the team is in doubt over sponsorship concerns, lost control over the crest after the tunnel, spinning into the outside barrier, rebounding into the inside barrier and coming to rest in the escape road. He was unhurt.
Red Bull had been expected to feature close to the front in Monaco, especially as Ricciardo is using one of only two existing versions of an upgraded Renault engine which have been rushed forward to an early debut for this race.
But the size of his margin to Mercedes was surprising - and the engine did not account for anything like the 0.964secs gap between Ricciardo and Verstappen, who won the last race in Spain.
The new engine is said to be worth up to 0.5secs a lap on a more normal circuit, but only 0.2secs around Monaco, where power has less of an effect on lap time than anywhere else.

Red Bull's pace appeared genuine - Ricciardo was also the quickest driver on the race-simulation runs during the second part of the session, by a little over 0.1secs a lap on average from Rosberg.
But Mercedes always find extra pace on Saturdays and still must be considered strong favourites for the weekend.
Meanwhile, the McLarens' pace was disappointing after they came into the weekend predicting both drivers would be in contention for the top 10 on the grid and behind only Mercedes, Red Bull and Ferrari.
Jenson Button was 10th, 1.718secs off the pace, and team-mate Fernando Alonso 0.4secs adrift in 11th place after not setting a representative lap on the fastest 'ultra-soft' tyre.

"Carlisle, who played for Burnley and QPR, tried to take his own life in December when he was hit by a lorry.
""People are delicate stepping around it - there's no shame invested in it for me,"" the 35-year-old said. ""I attempted suicide because I was very unwell.""
Carlisle was at the launch of a charter committed to tackling the stigma surrounding mental illness.
The Football Association, Rugby Football Union, Lawn Tennis Association and the England and Wales Cricket Board are among the sport governing bodies to have signed up to the Mental Health Charter for Sport and Recreation.
Carlisle suffered cuts, bruises, internal bleeding, a broken rib and shattered left knee when he was struck by a lorry on the A64 near York on 22 December.
Afterwards he said he had been left severely depressed by the end of his football career, financial problems and the loss of a TV punditry role.
He left hospital six weeks after being struck, following treatment as an in-patient at a psychiatric unit.
A former chairman of players' union the Professional Footballers' Association, he added:  ""I'm managing my illness on a daily basis and I can tell you today I'm very well.""
The first footballer to appear on Question Time, Carlisle had previously spoken out about depression and suicide in professional sport and presented a BBC Three documentary on the subject.

Mr Modamani, 19, became a social media star after taking the photo in 2015.

They included attacks in Brussels and on a Christmas Market in Berlin and crimes including an arson attack on a homeless man in Berlin.

Facebook to tackle fake news in Germany
Facebook deleted some malicious posts but Mr Modamani wanted an injunction forcing the company to actively identify and remove such posts rather than wait for users to flag them.
However the Wuerzburg court ruled that although the posts were ""undisputable defamation"", Facebook had not created the slanderous content itself, and so was not required to actively seek and delete the posts.
Mr Modamani is taking German classes and working in a restaurant, and said the fake posts about him were damaging, AFP news agency reported.
Lawyers for the social media giant had argued that, with billions of postings each day, the company would need ""a sort of wonder machine"" to detect each misuse. They said it was the individuals who posted the images who should be held responsible.
Mr Modamani's lawyer argued that Facebook had the technical ability to detect and block other content, such as pornography.
Facebook has faced criticism over its handling of fake news stories and recently launched filtering systems in the US, Germany and France.
It comes amid suggestions that fake news reports influenced the outcome of the US presidential election.

Three soldiers were found dead shortly after the incident and two more bodies were recovered late on Thursday night.

US Maj Gen John Uberti told a news conference on Friday that a search was still under way for four missing soldiers from the 1st Cavalry Division.

The 46-year-old former Juventus boss will begin a three-year contract after his country takes part in Euro 2016.
""I am proud to be the coach of the national team of my country and only a role as attractive as manager of Chelsea could follow that,"" he said.
Guus Hiddink, who replaced the sacked Jose Mourinho, will remain in charge of the Blues until the end of the season.
The final of Euro 2016 takes place on 10 July.
Conte, who won the Serie A title in each of his three years as Juventus boss, is the fifth Italian to manage Chelsea, following Gianluca Vialli, Claudio Ranieri, Carlo Ancelotti and Roberto di Matteo.
""We are very pleased to have recruited one of the most highly regarded managers in world football,"" said club director Marina Granovskaia.
""We are equally pleased to do so before the end of the current season. This aids our future planning.""
Conte has the task of rebuilding a side that won the Premier League title last season before imploding this term.
Mourinho's second spell came to an end on 17 December after a miserable start to the season and what Chelsea technical director Michael Emenalo described as ""palpable discord"" between the Portuguese and his players.
Hiddink restored stability in his second interim spell as boss - the Blues are 10th with seven games to go - but Chelsea will fail to win a trophy and are set to miss out on Champions League football next season.
His stats - courtesy of Opta - make impressive reading:
Former Juventus player Andrea Pirlo wrote this in his autobiography: ""Even when we're winning, Conte comes in and hurls against the wall (and thus my little corner).
""Anything he can lay his hands on... almost always full bottles of water. Fizzy water. Very fizzy water.""
When Conte speaks ""his words assault you"", says Pirlo, adding: ""They crash through the doors of your mind, often quite violently, and settle deep within you.""
Conte may have ""some problems"" adjusting to English football but his appointment will prove to be a ""good decision"", says former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini.
""It is difficult when a manager changes championships,"" Mancini, now in charge at Inter Milan, told BBC Sport.
""It is important that he knows the league very well and very quickly. Probably he could have some problems at the start of his job.""
Conte is a former Italy midfielder who made more than 400 appearances for Juventus, winning five league titles and a Champions League.
He won 20 caps for his country and was part of the squad beaten by France in the final of Euro 2000.
After spells coaching Arezzo, Bari, Atalanta and Siena, Conte returned to Juve in 2011, guiding them to the Serie A title at the first attempt.
However, he was then charged with failing to report attempted match-fixing during his time as coach of Siena.
Conte pleaded his innocence but was banned for 10 months - a sentence that was reduced to a four-month touchline suspension.
Juventus retained their title despite Conte's absence and won their third in succession the following season before his exit in 2014 to take over as Italy boss.
Despite serving that touchline ban, the issue remains an ongoing concern for the soon-to-be Chelsea manager.
Conte faces criminal proceedings after being accused of ""sporting fraud"", with a trial due to start in Italy this week.
Conte, who has always denied wrongdoing, is among 104 defendants.
He is likely to be fined if found guilty, according to his lawyer Leonardo Cammarata, who added Conte's reputation would be ""seriously damaged"".","Chelsea have appointed Italy boss Antonio Conte as their new first-team head coach, starting from this summer.",35960848
"Officers carried out ""extensive inquiries"" into claims of physical and sexual abuse at the now closed south London-based charity, but found no evidence to reach the threshold for criminal prosecution, a statement said.
No-one was interviewed under caution or arrested during the inquiry, it said.
Kids Company always denied the claims.
The children's charity, which was founded by Camila Batmanghelidjh in 1996, and had centres in London, Liverpool and Bristol, closed in August after questions over its management and finances.
Ms Batmanghelidjh said she ""burst into tears"" when police told her about their investigation.
""That's the reason the charity closed. We had money confirmed. But the philanthropists said they couldn't support us when we were informed there were allegations,"" she said.
""I'm very grateful to the police for acting honourably and fairly. I now think there needs to be an inquiry into how this situation came about, why was it in the hands of Newsnight and what happened after that and why weren't we properly informed.""
The investigation into Kids Company was believed to have been triggered by claims made by a former employee to a BBC Newsnight and BuzzFeed News investigation.
An independent expert advised the BBC that the claims raised concerns about the safeguarding of young people. Details from the interview were passed to the authorities, with the former employee's consent.
The charity - which relied on individual donations and government grants - closed after concerns were raised about its financial management and general administration.
Kids Company said its finances had become stretched because of the great number of children ""pouring through our doors"" for help.
But donors had been steadily withdrawing support, alarmed by stories of mismanagement.
Ms Batmanghelidjh said one donor who had offered Â£3m pulled out after learning of the allegations for which police have now concluded there is no evidence.
Last summer, the charity said it wanted to restructure and sought new funds from the government and donors.
But it closed in August when ministers finally pulled the plug, rejecting further funding.

"It is not clear how many times the maximum fine, £1,000, was imposed in that period.
However, according to the latest figures provided by the Education Authority,  two people were fined £1,000 in 2015-2016.
In total that year, 87 parents were convicted for their child's absence.
Seven people were fined £750, one was fined £650, eight were fined £500, with the reminder being fined smaller sums.
The BBC has also learned that in 2014-15, 144 people were taken to court, 50 convicted and 27 fined.
The 2014-15 figures were lower than each of the previous two years, with 41 parents fined in 2012-13 and 60 in 2013-14.
In England, a father has lost his legal challenge against a fine for taking his daughter on an unauthorised term-time holiday.
The Supreme Court ruled against Jon Platt, who had won earlier legal battles against a £120 fine in a case brought by the Isle of Wight council.
By law, parents are required to ensure that children aged between four and 16 receive a full-time education.
If they do not, schools and the education authority intervene.
Normally, if a pupil's attendance at school drops below 85% of days over a period of time, this triggers follow-up action.
Initially, this can involve a parental visit from an education welfare officer, and there is usually a long process before parents are prosecuted.","Between 2011 and 2016, 356 parents or guardians in Northern Ireland were convicted because their children were absent from school.",39516730

"Justin Welby made the promise during a private meeting with survivors of clerical abuse earlier this week.
The independent inquiry into child sex abuse led by Justice Lowell Goddard is expected to last five years.
Lambeth Palace said the archbishop wanted the Church to be reviewed first.
But it said if this did not happen within six months, the archbishop would instigate an ""independently-led past cases review"".
The Bishop of Norwich, the Right Revered Graham James, said the archbishop was one of the first to ask for a national inquiry into abuse and ""from all indications"" it appears the Church will be first to be examined.
In 2010, the Church published the results of a three-year investigation into abuse in the Church of England, spanning a 30-year period.
It uncovered just 13 cases which needed reporting to the authorities, prompting survivors to say the investigation was inadequate.
BBC religious affairs correspondent Caroline Wyatt said for this reason not all survivors of abuse wanted the Church to investigate itself.
Marilyn Hawes, who was one of five people representing survivors' groups at the Lambeth Palace meeting, said the archbishop had been compassionate and focused.
The founder of Enough Abuse UK, which she set up after three of her four children were abused by a Church of England headteacher, said she had ""every hope and belief"" he would follow through on his words.
But if he didn't, they would start ""banging drums again and making a noise,"" she said, ""because this is about a safer society and an environment called the church where people have to feel safe.""
She described the day of the meeting as a ""momentous one for the survivor community,"" adding that there needed to be an emphasis on abuse prevention in future.
""If we don't care for our children, then actually we care for nothing and nobody, and the people who should lead that are the Church,"" she said.
The Bishop of Durham, the Right Reverend Paul Butler, who speaks for the Church on safeguarding issues, acknowledged sex abuse had been covered up in the past.
""There are cases where that undoubtedly has happened and we've been slowly but surely uncovering more of them,"" he said.
""When the home secretary first called we said 'please, take the Church first' because we've been calling for this kind of inquiry earlier as well.""
Home Secretary Theresa May ordered the independent inquiry into abuse in England and Wales in July 2014, following claims of a high-level cover-up of child sex abuse involving public figures, including politicians and clergy.
The inquiry, which was given statutory powers and a new panel in February, was opened earlier this week by Justice Goddard, who is a New Zealand High Court judge.
It will investigate whether ""public bodies and other non-state institutions have taken seriously their duty of care to protect children from sexual abuse in England and Wales"".
Justice Goddard has issued a call for anyone with information about sexual abuse cases to come forward, urging institutions responsible for caring for children, which may come under scrutiny, to take a ""proactive stance towards the inquiry"".
She has written to more than 240 institutions, including the police, National Health Service and churches, asking for any documents that could be used in the inquiry.
The BBC's religious affairs correspondent Caroline Wyatt said the 2010 case review came after a three-year investigation by the Church of England into child abuse.
About 40,000 diocesan files dating back more than 30 years were examined during the inquiry.
Victims of alleged abuse in the Church of England compared this with a recent review of historical abuse cases by the much smaller Methodist church, which showed more than 900 such allegations going back to 1950, our correspondent added.
The Methodist Church's investigation uncovered reports of nearly 2,000 cases of abuse - including 914 allegations involving sexual abuse.",The Archbishop of Canterbury has promised to investigate sex abuse in the Church of England if the judge-led abuse inquiry does not look into it within six months.,33495726
"Between 2008 and 2016 investors quintupled the amount of money they put into such platforms, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said.
Companies such as Hargreaves Lansdown, Nutmeg and Interactive Investor now manage £592bn of savers' money.
The FCA will examine whether such firms help investors make good decisions.
It follows a previous inquiry into those who manage the funds that are sold on investment platforms, which found high levels of profitability.
The study found typical profit margins in the industry of 36% - and concluded that investors should be quoted a single fee, rather than a complex mix of charges.
Savers putting money into investment platforms pay a fee to each fund manager, as well as to the platform itself.
""With the increasing use of platforms, and the issues raised by our previous work, we want to assess whether competition between platforms is working in the interest of consumers,"" said Christopher Woolard, the FCA's executive director of strategy and competition.

"The train hit one of three wooden sleepers that fell on the track from a trailer, near Somerleyton in Suffolk.
The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said the crash happened on 18 June after Network Rail staff removed old sleepers and rails overnight.
Network Rail said safety rules about observation of loads were reissued to staff immediately after the crash.
A maintenance team spent the early hours of the day removing old wooden sleepers from the track between Somerleyton and Oulton Broad North station.
The report said guidelines had been flouted and no-one was given the job of ensuring ""nothing fell off"" the trailers.
The report said: ""The authorised work plan calls for a person to be appointed to monitor the load on each trailer.""
The passenger train from Norwich to Lowestoft was travelling at about 35mph (56km/h) when it hit the sleeper, just after 05:08 BST.

Teper is still ranked third by the IBF, while Price, who was ranked fifth last June, is no longer in the top 15.
""I have been cheated and I deserve something back,"" said Price, 32.
Former British and Commonwealth heavyweight champion Price has not fought since the defeat by Teper in Germany.
But he is set to make his comeback on the undercard of Tony Bellew's fight with Ilunga Makabu on 29 May.
Speaking to BBC Sport, Price said: ""The very least should be once I'm active again and winning, Teper is removed and I'm reinstated back into the top 15.
""Instead of being put to the back of the queue, I deserve to be back where I was before I was cheated. In any other sport that would happen.""
The Liverpudlian added: ""There's opportunities awaiting ranked fighters and I won't be denied because I've been cheated.""
Price has three defeats in his 22 professional fights.
As well as losing to Teper, he was beaten twice by American Tony Thompson, who also failed a drugs test after beating the Englishman.
The European Boxing Union took away Teper's European heavyweight title but maintained the original result of the fight.
The IBF told BBC Sport it would recognise any formal suspension of Teper from the EBU or German Boxing Commission, if that happened.
Teper will be removed from the rankings next month due to ""inactivity"" given he has not fought since facing Price.
Olympic bronze medallist Price added: ""As far as dealing with drugs cheats is concerned, boxing is in the dark ages. It is just common sense. If someone cheats in a fight, then their results should be scratched.
""In athletics, if the winner is banned for drugs, the person who finishes second gets the medal. It's so simple to do.""
The British Boxing Board of Control said it ""supports"" Price and will be discussing the matter with the IBF, EBU and Price's management.

Earlier this year, food writer Jack Monroe won Â£24,000 in damages, plus Â£107,000 in legal costs, in a libel action against Hopkins after a row over two tweets, which Monroe said caused ""serious harm"" to her reputation.
Hopkins was later told she could not appeal against the ruling.
In December, she apologised to a Muslim family she accused of being extremists after they were refused entry to the US for a Disneyland trip.
Mail Online, which published her claim, also paid Â£150,000 in libel damages to the Mahmood family.
During his election campaign, US President Donald Trump tweeted UK politicians should take notice of Hopkins and her views.
In December 2015 he called for a halt to Muslims entering the US.
In response to Mr Trump's comments, Hopkins wrote in her newspaper column that he should not be demonised.
""Thank you to respected columnist Katie Hopkins of the Daily Mail for her powerful writing on the UK's Muslim problems,"" Trump later said.
In a 2014 TV documentary, Katie raised more eyebrows when she said fat people were lazy. She added that she would not employ fat people because they look lazy.
She illustrated her point by managing to gain and then lose three stone in weight.
In November 2015, students from Brunel University walked out of a debate where Hopkins was invited as a guest.
Objections were raised to her attendance while during the debate about the future of welfare, students turned their backs to her and later walked out.
In 2013 she caused upset when she said she would not let her children play with lower class children with names like Chardonnay and Tyler.
She made the remarks during an appearance on ITV's This Morning programme.
She admitted that she judges children by their names.
But when she said she did not like children with geographical location names, it was pointed out that one of her children was called India.

"Senior Conservative Graham Brady has called for an end to the ""silly"" ban.
Ms Greening told the BBC the issue was ""an important debate"", but she would not ""make some big sweeping policy pronouncement"" at this stage.
Grammar schools are state secondaries that select their pupils by means of an examination at age 11.
There are currently about 163 in England - out of some 3,000 state secondaries - and a further 69 in Northern Ireland.
But under a law created by Labour's Tony Blair in 1998, no new grammar schools are allowed to open in England.
Ms Greening told the Andrew Marr Show the education system had changed ""dramatically"" from being a ""binary"" choice between grammar and secondary modern schools.
Grammar schools: What are they and why are they controversial?
She said: ""The setting in which schools find themselves has actually changed quite dramatically, it's gone from really being a binary world in many respects to being an education world where there are many different schools now that have many different offers.
""So I think we need to be prepared to be open-minded.""
Mr Brady, the chairman of the influential backbench Tory 1922 Committee, has urged the government to repeal the ban in the Daily Telegraph.
Asked if she was ""completely closed-minded"" to the idea, Ms Greening added: ""I think that the education debate on grammar schools has been going for a very long time, but I also recognise that the landscape in which it takes place has changed fundamentally.
""I think we need to be able to move this debate on and look at things as they are today, and maybe step away from a more old-fashioned debate around grammar schools and work out where they fit in today's landscape.""

"Maria Miller made the remarks on Twitter after the England women's cricket team beat Pakistan in their opening World Twenty20 match.
In what was seen as an emphatic victory, England beat their opponents by 43 runs in Galle, Sri Lanka.
Ms Miller said pay and prize levels should be reviewed.
In her first ever tweet she wrote: ""Well done to Eng women's cricket team! But big disparity in allowance/prize £ between them + men not right.""
Ms Miller, who is also the minister for women and equalities, added that cricket's international governing body, the ICC, ""must review"" the situation.
The World Twenty20 competition is taking place for both men and women simultaneously.
The men who are playing receive £61 per day during the tournament for food and living costs, the women £37.
In terms of tournament prize money, the winning men's team will take home £616,000, with £40,000 going to the women.
The England women's captain Charlotte Edwards has already said the ICC should look at the situation after the tournament, but did not want the debate to distract her team from their matches.
""It's not about the money for us. If we played for money we would be playing different sports,"" she told the BBC.
In a column for the BBC Sport website published earlier this week, the former men's England cricket captain Alec Stewart wrote:
""I don't have a problem with the discrepancy between the prize money for the men's and women's World Twenty20 competitions. Being brutally honest, you have to look at what brings in the money.

He called the discovery by windfarm developers ScottishPower Renewables and Vattenfall ""a significant achievement"".
Scans of the seabed turned up more than 60 wrecks over a two-year period. Most of these were already known about, but the U-boat was ""entirely unexpected"", developers said.

Of the explosions killed Brig-Gen Ali Abboud, chief-of-staff of the Jazeera and Badiya Operations Command.
Another eight soldiers were wounded in the attack, which comes after a wave of suicide bombings claimed by IS.
On Monday, at least 40 people were killed by an explosion at a funeral attended by Shia militia commanders in the eastern town of Muqdadiya, while a blast at a security checkpoint in Baghdad left eight security personnel dead.
Another 70 people died in the capital on Sunday, when two militants targeted a busy market in the predominantly Shia district of Sadr City.
Haditha and its nearby dam, about 190km (120 miles) north-west of Baghdad, are in one of the few parts of the mainly Sunni province of Anbar not controlled by IS.
Iraqi government forces and allied Sunni tribesmen based there have held off IS for more than 18 months with the help of air strikes by a US-led coalition.

"These are people who have either engineered airline IT networks or actually worked on British Airways' systems in the past.
What I've heard is a lot of confusion and scepticism at the idea that a local power surge could have wreaked such havoc.
There is also confusion as to why back-up systems didn't do their job.
Only the people in the room know exactly what happened, so these views are based on the information made public, and bucketfuls of IT experience, including at BA.
One put it like this: ""BA has two data centres near Heathrow, about a kilometre apart, so how could a power surge affect both?""
Then there are all the fail-safes in place.
The two data centres mirror each other I'm told, so when one collapses the other should take over.
All the big installations have back-up power. If the mains fails, a  UPS (uninterruptable power supply) kicks in. It's basically a big battery that keeps things ticking over until the power comes back on, or a diesel generator is fired up.
This UPS is meant to take the hit from any ""surge"", so the servers don't have to.
All the big servers and large routers, I'm told, also have dual power supplies fed from different sources.
I'm also told that, certainly a while ago, they used to have regular outages to confirm all the back-up bits were working. And daily inspections of the computer room. There is no reason to think these were stopped.
It's not even clear who was monitoring the system at the crucial time. Was it a contractor? How much experience did they have?
The point is this: certainly up until a while ago, British Airways' IT systems had a variety of safety nets in place to protect them from big dumps of uncontrolled power, and to get things back on their feet quickly if there was any problem. I'm assuming those safety nets are still there, so why did they fail? And did human error play a part in all this?
British Airways chief executive Alex Cruz told me recently that the company has launched an exhaustive investigation into what went wrong, although no-one can say when it will report back, and whether the findings will ever be made public.
If BA wants to repair its reputation, its owner IAG needs to convince the public that making hundreds of IT staff redundant last year did not leave them woefully short of experts who could have fixed the meltdown sooner. And that it won't happen again - at least not on this epic scale.

""We will still be taking decisions which are to the benefit of the people of Northern Ireland when we are in the post,"" he said.

""Without the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement, including welfare reform and public sector reform, the Executive's budget simply does not add up, posing a real threat to the delivery of front line public services in Northern Ireland,"" she said.
""We will be returning to these issues tomorrow.""
During the assembly debate on Tuesday, MLAs voted in favour of a motion expressing grave concern about the the absence of a health minister.
The department is currently vacant, due to the DUP's ""no business as usual"" approach to the political crisis concerning alleged IRA activity.
The motion, proposed by Sinn Féin, expressed concern about the need for a minister to address issues like waiting times and the health sector pay review.
Forty-eight MLAs backed the motion and 31 voted against.
The crisis at Stormont was sparked by allegations that IRA members were involved in the murder of a man in Belfast last month.
In the wake of the killing of Kevin McGuigan Sr, police said the IRA still existed, but added that it was not engaged in terrorism.
Sinn Féin said the IRA had ""gone away"".
The Ulster Unionist Party subsequently withdrew from Northern Ireland's ruling executive, saying Sinn Féin's denials had caused a breakdown in trust.

Mrs Foster added: ""I regret the fact that other parties did not agree to an adjournment so that we could focus exclusively on the talks process.""
Sinn Féin's Conor Murphy said the British and Irish governments had to play a ""constructive role"" in helping to achieve a resolution.
""All parties made it very clear that the ongoing impact of Tory austerity policies and the prospect of further cuts is creating a very real difficulty in terms of fulfilling our programme for government commitments,"" he said.

"Mr Miliband changed the system under which he was elected to ""one member one vote"" and allowed the public to take part for a Â£3 fee.
The move was overwhelmingly backed by a special Labour conference last year.
But backbench Labour MPs Simon Danczuk and Graham Stringer said the new system was too open to abuse.
Mr Miliband, who is on holiday in Australia, has opted not to comment on the leadership election.
Mr Stringer said he had left an ""unworkable"" system under which the party cannot know whether new supporters are members of other political parties who are joining to create mischief.
The veteran Labour backbencher believes the party will be seen as a ""laughing stock"" by Conservatives and left-wingers taking part in the ballot.
Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk said Mr Miliband should ""come out and apologise"" for the ""ridiculous leadership election rules"".
He said the experiment in moving the party to the left under Ed Miliband failed and moving it further to the left in the future would not help.
""If you get something so badly wrong on a range of points it's right and proper you come out and say sorry,"" Mr Danczuk told BBC News.
A Labour Party spokesman said: ""The Labour Party has a robust system to prevent fraudulent or malicious applications.
""All applications to join the Labour Party as a member, affiliate or supporter are verified and those who do not share Labour's aims and values will be denied a vote.""
Under the previous electoral college system union members, MPs and party members had one third of the vote each.
It was much criticised for giving too much influence to the trade unions and was changed last year, with union members now having to sign up as affiliated party members before being allowed to vote.
The new system has been hailed by the four candidates vying to be the next Labour leader for massively increasing the Labour Party's membership and support base.
At the general election Labour had just over 200,000 full members.
It now has 189,703 affiliated union members, 121,295 registered supporters and 299,755 full members, adding up to a total electorate of 610,753.
The party is currently attempting to vet all of the new applications to weed out mischief makers and non-Labour supporters - a mammoth task given there were 160,000 applications lodged with the party in the 24 hours before the deadline.
Neither Graham Stringer nor Simon Danczuk criticised Mr Miliband's decision to take a holiday but Mr Stringer said he should have stayed on as Labour leader until September's party conference to enable Labour to debate what went wrong at the general election.
Instead, he said the party had been left in an ""Alice in Wonderland"" situation where it will have ""the sentence before the verdict"".
Senior Labour backbencher and former minister Pat McFadden was among those who expressed concern at the time of the voting rule change.
He said he warned those behind the change that what was being proposed was not a simple ""one member one vote"" system and asked why that system of election wasn't being introduced instead.","Former Labour leader Ed Miliband is facing calls to apologise for the ""disastrous"" voting system being used to elect his successor.",33976474
"It is not clear whether the test was authentic, and if it was, whether it will be considered a success by the North.
A successful test would be significant because submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) are hard to detect.
It comes as North Korea gears up for a rare and significant party congress next month.
North Korea is banned from nuclear tests and activities that use ballistic missile technology under UN sanctions dating back to 2006.
""North Korea launched a projectile which was believed to be a submarine-launched ballistic missile around 6:30 pm (0930 GMT) in the East Sea (Sea of Japan) near the north-eastern port of Sinpo,"" a South Korea defence ministry spokesman said.
""We are keeping close tabs on the North Korean military and maintaining a full defence posture,"" he said.
North Korea has yet to report the test in its own official media. The secretive state has claimed to have carried out similar tests before but some doubt those claims.
The US says photographs supposedly showing one launch in December were manipulated and others think the North has fired missiles from submerged platforms, but not submarines.
Regarding this latest test, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that the missile travelled about 30km (19 miles), whereas a typical SLBM can travel at least 300km (186 miles).
North Korea has so far conducted four nuclear tests - the first one in October 2006 and the latest in January this year.
The UN Security Council responded to the latter by imposing  its strongest sanctions to date over the North's nuclear weapons programme.
Last month North Korea said it had developed nuclear warheads small enough to fit on ballistic missiles, although experts cast doubt on the claims.
Analysts believe the North may be gearing up for a fifth test as a show of strength ahead of the North Korean Workers' Party Congress, the first since 1980.","North Korea appears to have fired a ballistic missile from a submarine off its eastern coast, South Korea says.",36119159
"The report, in the journal PLOS Medicine, analysed genetic data from 21 studies - a total of 42,000 people.
It found every 10% rise in body mass index (BMI) - used as an indicator of body fat - led to a 4% drop of available vitamin D in the body.
As vitamin D is stored in fatty tissue, the authors suggest the larger storage capacity in obese people may prevent it from circulating in the bloodstream.
BMI it is calculated by taking weight (in kilograms) and dividing it by height (in metres) squared. Those with a BMI of 30 or above are considered obese.
Lead author Dr Elina Hypponen, from the University College London Institute of Child Health, said the study ""highlights the importance of monitoring and treating vitamin D deficiency in people who are overweight or obese"".
Vitamin D is made in the skin after sun exposure and can be taken in dietary supplements.
Healthy levels are about 50 nanomole per litre - less than 30 nanomole per litre can cause the softening and weakening of bones, leading to rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults.
Prof David Haslam, from the National Obesity Forum, said: ""Food intake and genetics all play a part in obesity - but this research is a reminder that physical activity, like walking the dog or going for a run out in the sunshine, shouldn't be forgotten and can help correct both weight and lack of vitamin D.""","Obesity can lower vitamin D levels in the body, a study suggests.",21339107
"Announcing the move in Paris, Theresa May said the internet must not be ""a safe space"" for extremists.
Speaking alongside President Emmanuel Macron, she said they would also look at proposals to fine social media firms if they fail to take down such content.
It is the PM's first foreign trip since losing her majority at the election.
It comes as UK officials gear up for the start of Brexit talks on 19 June - Mrs May confirmed those negotiations would begin on time despite the unexpected election result and the ongoing talks with the DUP to shore up a minority Conservative government.
Both France and the UK have faced multiple terror attacks in recent years. Three French citizens died in the attack on London Bridge earlier this month, and a British man, Nick Alexander, was killed in the attack on the Bataclan concert hall in Paris in November 2015.
Mrs May and Mr Macron had a working dinner before travelling to the England v France football friendly at the Stade de France, where there was a minute's silence before kick-off to honour those killed in the Manchester and London attacks.
At their joint press conference, Mrs May said the UK was already working with internet companies ""to stop the spread of extremist material that is warping young minds"".
But she said she and President Macron agreed those firms must do more ""and abide by their social responsibility to step up their efforts to remove harmful content"".
The joint UK-French campaign will explore options for creating ""a legal liability"" which would allow companies to be punished if they fail to take steps to remove terrorist content.
More meetings would be held in the coming days between the UK home secretary and the French interior minister to push forward those plans, the PM added.
Mr Macron said they wanted to ""strengthen the commitment"" of internet companies to removing extremist material.
The Metropolitan Police's head of counter-terrorism Mark Rowley echoed the prime minister's concerns that terrorist material was too easily accessible online.
Writing in the Times, Assistant Commissioner Rowley said: ""We need communities to be more assertive at calling out extremists and radicalisers amongst us. It's not just overseas propaganda inspiring attacks.
""And we need communications and internet-based companies to show more responsibility.
""It is too easy for the angry, violent or vulnerable to access extremist views, learn about attack methodologies, conspire on encrypted applications and then acquire equipment to kill, all online.""
Mr Rowley said ""an internet going darker"" was making it harder to look into people who may be of concern, but he welcomed Theresa May's efforts to look at strategies for dealing with extremism.
The government's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, Max Hill QC questioned whether heavy fines for tech companies that failed to take down extreme content was ""absolutely necessary"".
He told BBC News: ""I've sat with the relevant police unit as they identify extreme content. I've seen them communicating with tech companies and I've seen the cooperation that flows from that.
""It's a question of the bulk of the material rather than a lack of cooperation in dealing with it.""
Google says it already invests heavily in combating abuse on its platforms and is working on an ""international forum to accelerate and strengthen our existing work in this area"".
Facebook has also insisted it works ""aggressively to remove terrorist content from our platform as soon as we become aware of it"".

"The town hit the headlines last year when local police officers were linked to the disappearance of 43 students.
The government said corrupt officers from Cocula and nearby Iguala abducted the 43 and handed them over to a local drug gang, that then killed them.
The case highlighted high levels of corruption not just in the local police force but also in local government.
Mr Penaloza Santana was arrested on 16 December on suspicion of having links with ""a criminal group which operates in northern Guerrero state"", the prosecutor's office said.
Officials did not give any further details, but local media reported that a suspect in the students' disappearance had linked Mr Penaloza Santana to the Guerreros Unidos  (United Warriors) drug gang,
The 43 students from a teacher training college went missing on 26 September 2014.
The 43 were all students at an all-male teacher training college in the town of Aytozinapa, in south-western Guerrero state. The college has a history of left-wing activism and the students regularly took part in protests.
They disappeared from the town of Iguala on the evening of 26 September 2014 amid a confrontation between municipal police and the students in which six people were killed.
Independent forensic experts have matched charred bone fragments reportedly found at a rubbish dump near Iguala to Alexander Mora, one of the 43 missing students. They also say there is a high probability another set of remains could belong to Jhosivani Guerrero de la Cruz, another of the students. However, experts from the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights say the chain of evidence was broken and they could not be sure the bone fragments had been found at the dump.
According to the official report, the students were seized by corrupt municipal police officers who handed them over to members of a local drugs gang. The gang mistook the students for members of a rival gang, killed them and burned their bodies at the dump before throwing their ashes into a nearby stream.
They think officials have failed to investigate the role soldiers from a nearby barracks may have played in the students' disappearance. The government has refused to let the soldiers, who were in the area at the time of the disappearance, be questioned by anyone but government prosecutors. The families also point to the report by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights which said that there was no evidence the bodies of the 43 were burned at the dump.
A government investigation concluded that they were seized by corrupt municipal police officers, who handed them to members of the Guerreros Unidos.
According to the investigation, the students were killed by the gang, who mistook them for members of a rival group.
Their bodies were then burned at a rubbish dump outside of Cocula, the report said.
DNA tests revealed that bone fragments police said they had found at the rubbish dump were those of one of the missing students, Alexander Mora.
However, an independent investigation into the students' disappearance has since rejected the government's account of events.
The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights said in September that it had found no evidence that the bodies were incinerated.
The commission urged the government to continue looking for the missing students but did not offer any further clues as to what might have happened to them.","A court in Mexico has charged the former mayor of Cocula, Cesar Penaloza Santana, with links to organised crime.",35204835
"Now for the first time, Palestinian Catholics will also venerate two saints who lived in the Holy Land in modern times and were native Arabic speakers.
Marie Alphonsine Ghattas and Mariam Bawardy are among four 19th Century nuns who are being canonised by Pope Francis in Rome on Sunday.
At the house of Marie Alphonsine in Ein Karem, Sister Agatha shows around a large tour group of Christian women from Nazareth, in northern Israel.
""Every week parishioners come here,"" she tells me. ""They're very proud of her. She was Palestinian and she started her work here in Palestine.
""She was our first teacher, the first one to educate Arab girls and women. Now, we're continuing her mission and we're famous because of our students.""
Today, the Congregation of the Rosary Sisters, co-founded by Marie Alphonsine, runs many kindergartens and schools across the wider region.
At the Carmel Convent in Bethlehem, flags and banners have been put up to celebrate the canonisation of Mariam Bawardy, born in the Galilee.
A mystic, she is said to have carried out many miracles and to have experienced stigmata - wounds representing those suffered by Jesus on the cross.
""She's special because she was very simple, very humble,"" says Sister Feryal. ""This is really the way for being a saint.""
""Mariam was known as 'the little Arab' but she always said, 'I am the little nothing.' This was her way and she teaches us to follow her in this simplicity.""
Both nuns lived through tough conditions, overcoming male dominance in Ottoman society, poverty and ill-health while helping others.
They are said to have received apparitions of the Virgin Mary and remained in close communication with her.
By granting these women sainthood, the Church is celebrating their good works but it also showing support for Christians in the birthplace of their religion.
It is one year since Pope Francis visited the Holy Land, praying for peace at the high concrete wall in Bethlehem, part of Israel's controversial separation barrier.
Thousands of the faithful from the occupied Palestinian territories and Israel turned out to greet him and attend an open-air mass.
The total number of Christians in Israel and the Palestinian territories has declined to less than 2% of the population.
This is partly because of growing Jewish and Muslim populations, but also because of the conflict and the chance of better opportunities abroad.
This week the Vatican officially recognised the State of Palestine in a new treaty, to be signed in the coming months.
""I do not see the Pope taking this Palestinian-Israeli question off his agenda. It will remain there,"" comments Gerard O'Connell, Vatican correspondent and associate editor of America magazine.
""He is anxious to encourage the two peoples, to push and prod them to somehow make initiatives, so they take the next step. He's trying to use his moral authority to get them to come together.""
Palestinian church leaders and politicians, including the Muslim President, Mahmoud Abbas, will attend Sunday's consecration mass in Rome. Israel is sending a diplomatic delegation.
There will also be bishops from Jordan, Lebanon, Lebanon, Iraq, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Cyprus.
The hope is that this will send a message of hope for the wider Middle East, where Christians are fleeing war and persecution.
""Everyone is interested in this event to celebrate those two new heroes in a special way,"" says Father Jamal Khadr, head of the Latin Patriarchate Seminary in Beit Jala.
""They are heroes of peace, of education, of justice and fraternity with others. We need those role models in our lives when we suffer from so much violence and hatred.""","Each evening in May, Palestinian mothers and nuns come to the church at the Rosary Sisters Mamilla Convent in Jerusalem to pray to the Virgin Mary.",32757345

"BBC Sport brings you the five things you may have missed from another the thrill-a-minute Saturday in the Football League.
Some say 2-0 is the most dangerous scoreline in football - a lead big enough to prompt relaxation, but far from insurmountable - and Colchester fans will probably agree.
Going into their trip to Bury, the U's had not won a league game since 20 October, a run of 17 games.
So when they went 2-0 up inside the first 20 minutes, thanks to goals from Chris Porter and Gavin Massey, it looked as though they might be starting to claw their way back from the foot of League One.
But Tom Eastman was sent off for two bookings, and the floodgates did not just open, they were blown off their hinges.
Ryan Lowe pulled one back immediately after the red card before the Shakers hit four goals in 11 second-half minutes, including a hat-trick for Andrew Tutte, as the gap between Colchester and League One safety increased to 10 points.
""I'm sure they [the young players] will be better for the experience, even though it's a tough one to learn from,"" Colchester boss Kevin Keen, whose only win as boss came against Charlton in the FA Cup, told BBC Essex.
""I can't feel sorry for myself, I'll just keep working hard. It's about the club and the players.""
It might be all going wrong at Colchester, but the team directly below them in the Football League standings cannot do anything wrong.
After being endorsed by basketball legend Shaquille O'Neill this week, Northampton Town now boast a 10-point lead at the top of League Two following a club record ninth-successive league win.
Danny Rose netted his first goal for the Cobblers since a deadline-day move from Oxford United to seal victory against notoriously hard-to-beat Wycombe.
Surely promotion is a slam dunk now for Northampton?
Lloyd Doyley. He's not really a household name outside Hertfordshire, but after spending 14 years at Watford, he left the Hornets in the summer.
It took the 33-year-old until this week to find a new club, when Neil Warnock brought him and fellow free agent Paddy Kenny to Rotherham United.
Kenny was on the bench for the 2-0 loss at Burnley, and Doyley might have wished he was sat next to him as the Jamaica international gave away a penalty 27 minutes into his debut.
The Millers went on to lose 2-0, meaning Warnock is still looking for his first win since replacing Neil Redfearn as manager earlier this month.
A new boss who was smiling was Derby County's Darren Wassall.
After Paul Clement was surprisingly sacked earlier this month, 47-year-old Wassall was thrust into the limelight from the relative obscurity of the Rams' academy.
He lost his first game in charge during the week when Championship promotion hopefuls Derby went down 1-0 at home to relegation-threatened MK Dons.
It looked like he might lose his second as well, but his men scored three times in the final 10 minutes to win 3-1 at Brentford and chalk up Derby's first victory since Boxing Day to lift them to fifth.
Until this week the closest Bristol Rovers had been associated with Jordan was when Katie Price drove out of town on the M32.
But this week the men from the Mem were watched by the man from Amman for the first time, as new club's new Jordanian President Wael Al-Qadi cast his eye over his new acquisition.
His family have taken a 92% stake in the Pirates, with hopes of building a new ground and finally leaving the Memorial Stadium.
And he will no doubt have been pleased with what he saw, as Rovers came from a goal down to beat Morecambe 2-1 and move into the League Two play-off places.

Mr Najib, who has also been accused of misappropriating funds, has been cleared by Malaysian authorities.
The political scandal has gripped Malaysia, which has seen protests calling for Mr Najib's resignation.
The full background to the 1MDB scandal
Asia Business correspondent Karishma Vaswani: Malaysia PM in the clear?
In a statement, 1MDB's board acknowledged there had been lapses, but that it was strengthening its corporate governance.
It said it had been paying off its debts, which it had to incur because it had insufficient equity to make its investments.
The board members said their offer to resign ""has been a difficult decision to take but we believe is the right thing to do, given the circumstances, in order to facilitate any follow-up investigations as recommended"" by the parliamentary committee which conducted the inquiry.
The committee recommended that former chief executive officer Shahrol Azral Ibrahim Halmi be investigated.
It concluded that there were certain restrictions and weaknesses in 1MDB's management and board of directors, and that Mr Shahrol must take responsibility for those, according to the Malay Mail online.
Mr Shahrol has yet to comment.
Its report stated that 1MDB's management did not follow the board's instructions and made decisions without board approval, while the board ""was not proactive in scrutinising"" the management or the fund's cashflow.
It cited at least two examples:
The report also called for the fund's advisory board, which is chaired by Mr Najib, to be removed.
Opposition Member of Parliament Tony Pua, who was on the committee, said the report ""confirms gross mismanagement and wanton neglect of all principles of good governance and accountability"", and said Mr Najib should be held responsible.

"Goals from Cyprus internationals Nektarios Alexandrou and Pieros Sotiriou did the damage for TNS, who held Apoel to a goalless draw in the first leg at Park Hall last Tuesday.
Tomas de Vincenti added a late penalty for the hosts in injury time.
""I am immensely proud,"" said New Saints boss Craig Harrison.
""The second goal made it a huge ask and took the wind out of our sails.
""We had our chances, but that is me being ultra critical.""
Saints were left to rue missing two key chances in a contest in which scoring opportunities for the visitors were few and far between.
Jamie Mullan had a shot saved when he went clean through in the first period and Adrian Cieslewicz's goalbound shot was blocked on the hour as the Welsh side searched for an equaliser.
However, the Cypriot champions kept captain Paul Harrison busy throughout.
Nuno Morais, formerly with Chelsea, fired a dipping effort just wide before Sotiriou missed a free header.
Vander Vieira crashed the ball against the crossbar as Nicosia pressed, before Sotiriou's header was brilliantly cleared off the line by defender Phil Baker, whose 31 appearances in Europe is a new record for a Welsh club player.
However, the quality of Sotiriou eventually told after the interval, his movement allowing captain Alexandrou to fire through a crowd and beat Harrison at his near post on 53 minutes.
Sotiriou hit the inside of the right hand post as Saints clung on, but when he was given too much space with 20 minutes remaining he swivelled and fired home from close range to end any hopes of a comeback.

However, alcohol sales remain 17% higher than in England and Wales.
This was said to mainly be due to higher sales through supermarkets and off-licences in Scotland, particularly of lower-priced spirits.
Since their peak in 2009, alcohol sales have declined by 9% - equivalent to about nine million fewer bottles of wine, three million fewer bottles of spirits or 38 million fewer pints of beer per year.
Although alcohol-related deaths have fallen by 35% since 2003, the report said they remained 1.4 times higher than 1981 and hospital admissions were 1.4 times higher than 1991/92.
The report also showed that the proportion of alcohol sold at below 50p per unit (ppu) in Scotland's off-sales - the initial price proposed for minimum pricing - was declining.
Clare Beeston, principal public health adviser at NHS Health Scotland, said: ""Alcohol sales are falling in both Scotland and England and Wales, and it is likely that declining affordability of alcohol, due to the economic downturn across the whole of Great Britain in recent years, is responsible for some of these improvements.
""However, the ban on multi-buy promotions for alcohol and the increased number of people accessing specialist services are also likely to be contributing to the improvements seen in Scotland.""
Health Secretary Shona Robison said: ""The Scottish government is committed to tackling Scotland's difficult relationship with alcohol, so it is encouraging to see a downward trend in alcohol-related harm, and for this trend to be particularly evident in our most deprived communities.
""However, the fact remains that on average almost 700 people per week are admitted to hospital in Scotland due to alcohol, which is why we are absolutely committed to introducing minimum unit pricing.
""This is about targeting the cheap high-strength alcohol that causes so much harm within our communities, often in the most deprived areas of Scotland.""
She added: ""Given the link between consumption and harm, and evidence that affordability is one of the drivers of increased consumption, addressing price is an important element of any long-term strategy to tackle alcohol misuse.""",Alcohol consumption in Scotland has fallen by the equivalent of 38 million pints of beer a year since 2009.,30382290
"An application by RWE Innogy for the 415ft (126m) turbines at Hemswell Cliff, near Gainsborough, was rejected in 2013 but the company appealed.
The government cited a number of issues it had with the project including the impact on the landscape and the effect on designated heritage sites.
RWE said it was ""disappointed"" with the Secretary of State's decision.
The main issues for Mr Clark were the effects on ""designated heritage assets"" like the Hemswell Conservation Area.
He also stated that the turbines would have a ""significant"" impact on the landscape for about 3km (1.86 miles) from the site.
The plans had been met with a number of objections from local residents who formed the campaign group Villages of the Cliff Against Turbines.
They said the development would have ""ruined the countryside"".
The group was backed by the MP for Gainsborough Sir Edward Leigh who said he was ""delighted"" the plans were turned down.
RWE Innogy had argued the wind farm could power 11,600 homes.
Mark Crawford, its regional development manager, said: ""We are disappointed that the Secretary of State has refused planning permission.
""At a time when onshore wind farms like Hemswell Cliff could make a real positive difference to climate change, energy bills and local investment, it is a shame that the project will not proceed further.""

"If Rombertik's evasion techniques are triggered, it deletes key files on a computer, making it constantly restart.
Analysts said Rombertik was ""unique"" among malware samples for resisting capture so aggressively.
On Windows machines where it goes unnoticed, the malware steals login data and other confidential information.
Rombertik typically infected a vulnerable machine after a booby-trapped attachment on a phishing message had been opened, security researchers Ben Baker and Alex Chiu, from Cisco, said in a blogpost.
Some of the messages Rombertik travels with pose as business enquiry letters from Microsoft.
The malware ""indiscriminately"" stole data entered by victims on any website, the researchers said.
And it got even nastier when it spotted someone was trying to understand how it worked.
""Rombertik is unique in that it actively attempts to destroy the computer if it detects certain attributes associated with malware analysis,"" the researchers said.
The malware regularly carries out internal checks to see if it is under analysis.
If it believes it is, it will attempt to delete an essential Windows system file called the Master Boot Record (MBR).
It will then restart the machine which, because the MBR is missing, will go into an endless restart loop.
The code replacing the MBR makes the machine print out a message mocking attempts to analyse it.
Restoring a PC with its MBR deleted involves reinstalling Windows, which could mean important data is lost.
Rombertik also uses other tricks to foil analysis.
One involves writing a byte of data to memory 960 million times to overwhelm analysis tools that try to spot malware by logging system activity.
Security expert Graham Cluley said destructive viruses such as Rombertik were quite rare.
""It's not the norm,"" he said.
""That's because malware these days doesn't want to draw attention to itself, as that works against its typical goal - to lie in wait, stealing information for a long time.""",A computer virus that tries to avoid detection by making the machine it infects unusable has been found.,32591265

"The XH558 has been based at South Yorkshire's Robin Hood Airport since March 2011 after the RAF Lyneham base closure was announced.
It has been decided that ""challenging modifications"" to both wings would not be sustainable to the old aircraft.
The Vulcan to the Sky Trust said it decided not to fund the repairs.
Trust chief executive Dr Robert Pleming told supporters: ""At the end of next year, she will need a Â£200,000 modification to her wings to increase her flying life.
""We know that you would do your utmost to fund this work, but for a number of reasons we have decided not to ask you to take this risk.""
In May, Doncaster Robin Hood Airport was forced to close temporarily after the Vulcan bomber aborted take-off due to an engine fault.
The trust's engineering director Andrew Edmondson added: ""There is no possibility of rectification if an error is made. We are not saying we cannot do it, just that it is risky so other factors must be taken into account.
""From the start of the 2014 season, it is unlikely that we could accommodate any engine failures.
""There are no more airworthy engines available, and refurbishment would be so difficult and costly that there is no possibility that it will happen.""
The Vulcan to the Sky Trust, which has kept the bomber in the skies for six years, said it needed in excess of Â£1m to carry out repairs and maintenance in coming months.
It was restored at Bruntingthorpe in Leicestershire with the majority of the funding coming from public donations and the Heritage Lottery Fund.
The Vulcan XH558 took its first flight on 25 May 1960 and was originally built to carry nuclear weapons but was only ever used as a nuclear deterrent.
The bomber retired from service in 1993 and is the only one left of the 134 that were built for the Royal Air Force.","The last airworthy Vulcan bomber will fly for the final time next year, the trust which funds the aircraft has confirmed.",19926464

"The company also said it had secured additional funds from shareholders and was close to announcing its biggest ever investment.
The news came just ahead of a midnight deadline for the renewal of its Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) licence.
Last weekend Monarch was forced to deny ""negative speculation"" about its financial health.
It has struggled under intense competition and a fall in demand for holidays in Turkey and Egypt.
A Monarch spokesman told the BBC that all flights on Saturday were flying as normal. The company operates 130-140 outbound and inbound flights a day, and passengers had been expressing concern on social media about whether all those flights would take place.
There are more than 100,000 Monarch holiday-makers overseas at the moment.
The airline employs about 2,800 staff and is based at Luton Airport.
The 12-day reprieve has been welcomed by Brian Strutton, general secretary of the pilots' union Balpa, who said the uncertainty had been lifted ""which is good news for the pilots, crew, staff and customers"".
He added: ""Although the Monarch licence has been extended temporarily for 12 days, my understanding is this will be sufficient to satisfy the regulator that long-term funding is secure and details of this will emerge over the next few days.""
Monarch is protected by the CAA's Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (Atol) scheme - the scheme that refunds customers if a travel firm collapses, and ensures they are not stranded.
But for the licence to be renewed, allowing Monarch to continue to sell package holidays, the company had to prove it was financially robust.
The company has been majority owned by Greybull Capital since 2014, when the investment firm bought a 90% stake in the airline.
Greybull has now put extra funds into the airline, enabling the CAA to grant a temporary extension to the airline's licence until 12 October.
By that time Monarch is confident it will have secured the ""largest investment in its 48-year history"".
Chief executive Andrew Swaffield said he was ""excited about the additional capital coming into the group which will help us fund our future growth"".
It is believed that some of the money will be used to proceed with an order for 30 Boeing aircraft.
In its statement, the CAA said it was able to extend the licence ""by requiring the shareholder to provide additional funding and because customers' money will be protected"".
""Monarch now has 12 days to satisfy the CAA that the group is able to meet the requirements for a full Atol licence.
""Monarch will remain Atol licensed until this extension expires. The CAA always advises consumers to ensure they book Atol-protected air holidays and consumers who choose to book an Atol-protected flight or holiday with the company during this time will continue to be protected by the Atol scheme.""
Monarch says Atol offers consumers security ""where a flight and accommodation have been booked together, some flights booked separately and applies in certain other circumstances"".
Earlier this year Greybull bought a division of Tata Steel, as well as 140 M Local convenience stores from Morrisons, which subsequently went into administration.
A former managing director of Monarch, Tim Jeans, told BBC Breakfast the company had been having difficulties for some time.
""They certainly have to come up with the money and the investment to satisfy the CAA in those 12 days, otherwise the future does look rather bleak.
""One has to trust in the reassurances the company has given, and hope that Monarch, which has a great heritage as a British airline, carries on well into the future.""
And the Independent's travel editor Simon Calder told the BBC that Monarch was a ""much smaller and less agile"" operation than the giants of low-cost aviation, Ryanair and Easyjet.
He added: ""The fall in sterling means many of Monarch's costs, the leases on its aircraft, the fuel in its tanks, are much more expensive and there is generally a weakness in demand.""",Budget airline Monarch has received a temporary extension to its licence to sell package holidays.,37524259

"Ahead of a visit to the UK, Mr Sisi told the BBC that Egypt was threatened by extremist groups and feared the collapses suffered by its neighbours.
He underlined that Egypt's situation was different to that of Europe.
The retired field marshal led the army's overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi in 2013 following mass protests.
Since then, hundreds of people have been killed and more than 40,000 are believed to have been jailed in a crackdown on dissent.
Most of them have been supporters of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, but secular and liberal activists have also been prosecuted for breaking a 2013 anti-protest law that gives the interior ministry the power to ban any gathering of more than 10 people.
In an interview with the BBC in Cairo before he embarked on his first official visit to the UK, Mr Sisi said Egypt was still on a path to democracy that started with the 2011 revolution that toppled President Hosni Mubarak, but needed time to achieve its goals.
""We want to carry out the will of the Egyptian people,"" he said. ""They have been calling for change for four years. We want to honour their choice and will do our best to achieve a better democratic future for them.""
""What has been achieved in our experience may not be the best, but we are going ahead with it and we will make further progress,"" he added.
Mr Sisi said the low turnout in the first round of the parliamentary elections last month was neither unexpected nor evidence of growing disillusionment with his rule.
He also defended the anti-terrorism legislation he enacted in August, which activists said further eroded basic rights and enshrined a permanent state of emergency.
President Sisi knows he has a case to make to convince the West - and some in his own country - that he is taking Egypt on the road to what he calls a real democracy.
It's a case he seems confident he can make even if critics deride him as a dictator. He appears at ease fielding questions on everything from his harsh counter-terrorism law to the West's failure to stop the rise of the so-called Islamic State in his region.
The former army chief wants to dispel any impression he's still a military man who now wears a smart blue suit.  But security is still clearly uppermost in his mind even as he invokes the spirit that inspired Egyptians nearly five years ago to rise up for greater freedom as well as jobs and bread.
After all, he says, if Egyptians decide they don't want him in power they can now vote him out. But he speaks with the confidence of a man who believes he will be at the helm for a while.

""We want some stability,"" he explained. ""We don't want to do this by force or suppression. We want to regulate and organise society.""
The president said critics in the West had to appreciate the threats faced by Egypt, where jihadist militants have killed at least 600 security personnel over the past two years.
""Give me the environment in Europe to be available here in Egypt, and you will never need anything of the kind,"" Mr Sisi insisted.
What millions of Egyptians wanted most of all, he added, was a decent standard of living.
""It's fine to check on human rights in Egypt. But the millions who are in difficult economic conditions - wouldn't it be better to ask about them?""
The president also stressed that the hundreds of people sentenced to death in connection with the unrest surrounding the overthrow of Mr Morsi were unlikely to be executed, either because they were convicted in absentia or due to the appeals process.
The UN has said fair-trial guarantees appear to be increasingly trampled upon in Egypt, while the Brotherhood has said the trials of its leaders and supporters are politically motivated and attempts to give legal cover to a coup.
Asked whether the Muslim Brotherhood - a group he had vowed last year to ""wipe out"" - could once again play a part in Egypt's future, Mr Sisi said: ""They are part of Egypt and so the Egyptian people must decide what role they can play.""","President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has defended Egypt's sweeping security laws, insisting he is still taking the country on a path to democracy.",34712217

"The offshore patrol vessels (OPVs) will be built in Glasgow by BAE Systems under a Ministry of Defence contract.
Workers at BAE's Clyde shipyards are already building three similar vessels for the Royal Navy.
The move will fill a gap in the order book at the yards, where work is due to begin on eight Type 26 frigates next summer.
The contract was confirmed by Defence Procurement Minister Harriett Baldwin during a visit to Govan shipyard.
She said: ""This contract will deliver two more modern Offshore Patrol Vessels, HMS Tamar and HMS Spey, for the Royal Navy and safeguard vital shipbuilding skills and hundreds of jobs in Scotland.""
HMS Tamar and HMS Spey will be manufactured at the Govan shipyard before being floated to Scotstoun to be fitted out. They are expected to be delivered in 2019.
Iain Stevenson, managing director of BAE Systems Naval Ships, said: ""Securing this contract for two further River Class OPVs is testament to the proven capability of the design and the tremendous skill and dedication of employees on the programme.""
According to the MoD, work on the five new vessels is sustaining 800 jobs at shipyards on the Clyde, as well as posts at more than 100 companies in the UK supply chain.
The GMB union said the latest contract was ""good news for the workers and good news for the Scottish economy"".
GMB Scotland organiser Gary Cook said: ""This OPV work provides continuity for our members on the Upper Clyde between now and the manufacture of the Type 26 frigate programme.
""The yards support over 2,700 directly employed jobs, generating over Â£92m in wages - a massive contribution towards the prosperity of communities on the Clyde and the Greater Glasgow area - and we cannot do without them.""
The contract announcement comes a month after Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said that he hoped to conclude negotiations on the two additional warships ""before Christmas"".
The government announced plans to order two extra offshore patrol vessels during its Strategic Defence and Security Review last November.
They are used to support counter-terrorism, counter-piracy and anti-smuggling operations.
In August HMS Forth, the first patrol vessel from the earlier order for the Royal Navy, was unveiled on on the Clyde.
It took to the water for the first time as it travelled from the shipyard at Govan, where it was built, to Scotstoun, where it is being finished and tested.
The warship is expected to be delivered to the Royal Navy next year.
Earlier this month Defence Secretary Michael Fallon confirmed that work on eight Type 26 frigates would start at the same yards in 2017.
He said the move would safeguard hundreds of skilled jobs until 2035.
The frigates are principally designed for anti-submarine warfare and the first vessel is due to enter service in the early 2020s.
The promise of new Royal Navy orders to secure the Clyde shipbuilding industry was made before the Scottish independence referendum in 2014.
An Â£859m initial development deal to build the combat ships, at BAE's Govan and Scotstoun yards on the River Clyde in Glasgow, was signed in February 2015.
But the project has been scaled back from an initial 13 ships to eight and hit by repeated delays, with concerns that jobs could be lost as a result.
The MoD now plans to build a number of smaller, general purpose Type 31 frigates in addition to the Type 26s - but it has not been confirmed where these would be built.
Last week an independent report on Britain's shipbuilding programme, by Sir John Parker, suggested that construction might be shared between different companies across the UK.
A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""Clyde ship-building has a world-class reputation and the contract awarded to BAE Systems proves yet again that the company and its workforce have the skills and capabilities to deliver the highest quality vessels.
""It is crucially important that the work promised to Scottish shipyards by the Ministry of Defence is delivered as pledged.""","Two more Royal Navy warships are to be built on the Clyde under a deal worth Â£287m, the UK government has confirmed.",38241903
"One measure of that borrowing is used to calculate the annual budget deficit. Public borrowing was around £154bn in 2009-10 and is expected to fall to just over £90bn in 2014-15 - so we have seen the deficit fall by around a third.
The coalition government oversaw a generally smooth decline in the deficit. The Labour administration, which ran from 1997 to 2010, witnessed a very different path in government borrowing. Between 1997-98 and 2000-01, Labour reduced government borrowing and actually ran a surplus for three years (where the government received more money than it spent). However, between 2001-02 and 2009-10, the Labour government saw the deficit rise from £1bn to £154bn.
Looking ahead, the Conservatives want to eradicate the whole deficit, and even run a surplus, by the end of the next parliament.
Meanwhile Labour is chasing a different target. Rather than eradicate the whole deficit - covering all public sector borrowing - Labour hopes to eradicate only one part of the deficit: the current budget deficit.
This measure of the deficit only looks at borrowing to cover day-to-day spending. Under Labour's plan, the government would still be allowed to borrow money to invest in long-term projects, such as infrastructure. So the Conservative plan is stricter.

"The Grecians made a blistering start and were 2-0 up inside the first six minutes. The first came after great play by David Wheeler and Reuben Reid, who teed-up Jordan Moore-Taylor to rifle in a fourth-minute opener.
Then, as Barnet struggled to clear their lines, Jake Taylor poked the ball to Wheeler who managed to squeeze the ball past Jamie Stephens from barely two yards out.
Ruben Bover forced goalkeeper Christy Pym into a smart stop with a fierce free-kick and Simeon Akinola glanced a header wide as Barnet responded, while Harry Taylor was also foiled by Pym with a shot from distance.
Wheeler was off-target on the hour mark for Exeter before John Akinde reduced the arrears in the 69th minute when he smashed the ball into the back of the net from 10 yards.
As Barnet pressed for an equaliser, Pym saved well to deny Mauro Vilhete and Akinde headed a great chance over the crossbar in stoppage time.

"Patients in England will also be able to enter symptoms online and receive tailored advice or a call back from a health professional.
The NHS.uk website will allow patients to book appointments, access medical records and order prescriptions.
The initiatives are part of moves towards a paperless NHS.
It was announced in February this year that £4bn had been set aside for the IT initiative.
The new online triage system is part of an expansion of the current NHS 111 non-emergency phone line service.
The service is being developed with leading clinicians and will be piloted before the public can use it.
The re-launched NHS website will also allow patients to compare how well their local health services perform in areas of dementia, diabetes and learning disability services.
Data on maternity, cancer and mental health data will be added in the autumn.
The site will also have a new collection of NHS-approved health apps to guide patient choice.
Mr Hunt said: ""We are going to make very big moves in the next 12 months into apps and wearables,
""I wear a Fitbit, many people use apps. What is going to change with apps is the way that these apps link directly into our own medical records.
""And by March next year NHS England are going to publish a library of approved apps in areas like mental health and chronic conditions like diabetes.
""We will also in the next 12 months be having a competition because we think we need better apps than the ones that are available in the market.
""We don't want to develop them ourselves but we want them to be developed by entrepreneurs who have the specialist knowledge and creativity to do this.
""These will link into people's medical records.""
In 2012 ministers had promised that within three years patients in England would be able to book GP appointments and get test results online.
In 2013 Mr Hunt said he wanted the NHS to be paperless by 2018 - with the first step, giving people online access to their health records supposed to be available by March 2015.

"Greece has also expressed ""displeasure"" after the controls left thousands of migrants stranded in the country.
Thousands of migrants have been trapped in Greece after Macedonia barred entry to Afghans, days after Austria brought in new controls.
Latest figures show a huge rise in the numbers of migrants arriving in Europe.
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) says more than 100,000 asylum seekers have arrived so far this year, compared to fewer than 4,000 in the first two months of 2015.
Greece is the main arrival point for the migrants and refugees, having been smuggled across the sea from Turkey.

Europe's migrant crisis
""We are concerned about the developments along the Balkan route and the humanitarian crisis that might unfold in certain countries especially in Greece,"" a joint statement by EU migration commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and Dutch migration minister Klaas Dijkhoff said.
""We call on all countries and actors along the route to prepare the necessary contingency planning to be able to address humanitarian needs, including reception capacities.
""In parallel, the commission is co-ordinating a contingency planning effort, to offer support in case of a humanitarian crisis both outside and within the EU, as well as to further co-ordinate border management.""
The head of the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) also warned on Tuesday that border closures in EU states would cause ""further chaos and confusion"".
Filippo Grandi, visiting the Greek island of Lesbos where many migrants arrive, said it would increase the burden on Greece ""which is already shouldering a very big responsibility"".
Greece expressed ""displeasure"" at the border restrictions, the office of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said, and also complained to the EU that it had not been invited to a conference on migration in Vienna on Wednesday which will be attended by Balkan states.
Austria has rejected the criticism.
On Tuesday, Greece began sending hundreds of Afghans back to Athens from its border with Macedonia.
Macedonia suspended all border crossings on Monday after Afghans staged a sit-down protest and occupied a railway line.
Macedonian police said Afghans had been stopped because Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia had ""decided to reduce their numbers"" and started sending them back to Macedonia.
""We can't allow Macedonia to become a buffer zone and refugee camp,"" a foreign ministry official was quoted as saying.
The move came two days after Austria controversially introduced a daily limit on asylum applications and on migrants travelling through the country.
Mr Avramopoulos has said the cap is ""plainly incompatible"" with Austria's obligations under EU and international law.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker also criticised the Austrian move, saying that ""solo national approaches were not recommended"".
EU leaders have announced they will hold a summit in early March with Turkey to attempt to seek fresh solutions to the crisis.
Turkey is home to nearly three million refugees, most of them from Syria.
Many of them pay smugglers thousands of dollars to make the crossing to Greece. They then head north, trying to reach Germany and Scandinavia.
A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.",The EU says it is making plans to deal with a possible humanitarian crisis as new border controls halt migrants moving through the Balkans.,35643951
"Andrew Griffiths said the joined-up nature of NHS Wales and a Â£11m computer investment meant fewer vulnerabilities.
His department coordinates computer systems across seven health boards.
Friday's cyber attack disrupted health organisations in England and Scotland.
But speaking exclusively to BBC Wales, Mr Griffiths, director of NHS Wales Informatics Service (NWIS) warned against complacency and said the organisation needed to be vigilant and to continue to invest in cyber-security in the face growing threats.
""We weren't lucky we were prepared and that preparedness stood us in good stead,"" he said.
""No system is 100% certain but we did have the systems processes and people in place to make sure the attacks couldn't get through.
""Because we had invested in infrastructure, because we've got a common infrastructure across Wales, we were able to patch more easily and keep up to date - because we were less fragmented it removed a lot of vulnerabilities from the system.""
Mr Griffiths praised a superb effort from staff working around the clock to tackle the threat
""I'm immensely proud of on-call colleagues who came in. They called other colleagues - people who weren't on-call to come in.
""There wasn't a question about coming in... and everybody's worked superbly across the NHS. It was a brilliant exercise in cooperation.""
But he warned against complacency and said lessons will be learnt
""Clearly we don't want cyber attacks, clearly we can't be complacent and we have to be vigilant and continue to make the right investments and continue to make sure our processes are working,
""There will be things too learn from this experience... But I think it's a good moment to recognise that planning and the fact we were prepared, that we've invested in common systems and processes have really paid off.""

He has not yet said which way he will campaign in a future referendum.

The prime minister has said he wants a ""better deal"" for the UK within the European Union ahead of an in-out referendum by the end of 2017. He is expected to set out the changes he wants to see in more detail in a letter to EU officials next week ahead of a key summit next month.

"It will see 84 turbines installed in the Outer Moray Firth, which will generate 588MW of power once operational in 2019.
The Scottish government gave the project consent in March 2014 and it was granted an investment contract by the UK government in May that year.
Construction work is expected to start next year.
The harbour at Wick will be used for the shipping in and out of equipment, turbines and construction workers.
SSE has the largest stake in the project - 40% - with organisations Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners having a 35% stake and SDIC Power 25%.
The project will be one of the largest private investments ever made in Scottish infrastructure, according to SSE.
It has claimed the farm would generate enough electricity for 450,000 properties and support about 890 jobs.  Ninety staff would be needed to maintain the farm once it was operational.
Conservation group WWF Scotland said the scheme would help to tackle climate change, while Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) said it would bring important investment and jobs to the Highlands and Moray.
Paul Cooley, director of renewables at SSE, said: ""Contracts have already been placed with many UK based suppliers, and Siemens intend to undertake turbine blade construction from Siemens' new manufacturing facility in Hull.

""Until we have closed those two gaps, it's not realistic to talk about title challenges.""
Ferrari had their worst season in 21 years in 2014, the nadir of a slump in performance that convinced Fernando Alonso to leave the team two years before the end of his contract because he had lost faith that they could give him a car in which he could win a third world title.
Ferrari have made significant progress this season, thanks in large part to a big step forward in performance from their engine, their biggest weak point in 2014.
But Allison said there was no reason at this stage to revise the aims the team set for themselves at the beginning of the season.
""We thought it was realistic to score a couple of wins,"" Allison said. ""We'll take whatever comes our way and will do our best to close up [the gap] as much as we can.
""But sticking with the objectives we set at the beginning of the year is still realistic.""
Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was second fastest to Hamilton in practice at the Chinese Grand Prix on Friday, and the team looks set to be Mercedes' closest challenger over the weekend in Shanghai.
Hamilton appeared to have an advantage in pace of at least half a second a lap in both single-lap, qualifying trim and on race-simulation laps.
But it seemed clear from Friday practice that Ferrari continued to have lighter tyre usage than Mercedes, an asset that was a key factor in Vettel's win in Malaysia two weeks ago.
But the conditions are significantly cooler than in tropical Malaysia - the forecast is for dry weather, with temperatures expected to rise to about 20C in the race  from 16C on Friday - so it should be easier for Mercedes to keep the tyre situation under control.

"The 24-year-old was ""assaulted daily"" by Gavin Pascoe and Vicki Jepson at their home in Aspley, Nottingham, where she was kept for five months.
The city's crown court heard on Friday Jepson also stole the woman's benefits.
Pascoe, 37, was jailed for four years and Jepson, 29, for two-and-a-half years.
The court was told how the woman was taken to the couple's house in Rosslyn Drive in August 2014 by someone she met online.
Using threats of violence against the victim and her family, they kept her prisoner.
She was made to sleep on the kitchen floor or in a duck pen, while during the day she was subjected to beatings, threats and intimidation.
If she refused to do as she was told, she was soaked with cold water. On one occasion Pascoe attacked her with a hockey stick, the court heard.
She suffered a broken wrist and ribs and a medical exam found scarring on her back, thighs and arms.
The victim escaped when a relative of Pascoe's visited and told her to get out. She ran to a neighbour's house and the police were called.
Pascoe pleaded guilty to forced labour, one count of grievous bodily harm and committing actual bodily harm on at least 10 occasions.
Jepson admitted forced labour, theft and committing actual bodily harm on at least five occasions.

There was also a 20% rise in the number of households who were re-housed outside their local area.
According to the figures, 18,600 households were re-located, the highest number ever. Almost all of them were in London.
The number of children who were in temporary accommodation - and therefore classified as homeless - rose to 103,430 in the quarter, the highest number since 2008.
""These figures are a heart-breaking reminder that thousands of families will wake up homeless this Christmas morning - many hidden away in a cramped and dingy B&B or hostel room, sometimes miles away from everyone and everything they know,"" said Campbell Robb, the chief executive of Shelter.
The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has announced a new fund worth £5m, to be spent across 25 of the worst-affected local authorities.
The authorities, most of which are in London, will be able to apply for up to £200,000 each, but the money must be spent before April next year.
""Time spent in temporary accommodation ensures no family is without a roof over their head,"" said Communities Minister Marcus Jones.
""The number of households living in temporary accommodation is still significantly lower now than the peak in 2005, but we recognise that many councils still face significant challenges.""

"Initial advice was the Osprey's sprained ankle would require a long rest, but he will play against Scotland in Cardiff on Saturday.
Gatland said: ""The medics thought that it was a three-to-five-week injury.
""But the scan came back clear and he's worked really hard. He's made a pretty miraculous recovery really.""
Biggar has been ""icing"" his injury every two hours since the match in Dublin.
But his inclusion in the team was only confirmed after he took part in a full training session on Thursday morning.
""It was just a normal training session,"" added Gatland.
""He was a little bit sore yesterday so he had to get through today's training.""
Gatland joked that Biggar's recovery had earned him the nickname ""Lazarus"" among the players - a title previously given to centre Jamie Roberts.
""He's taken that mantle now off Jamie,"" said Gatland.
New Zealander Gatland has named an unchanged starting line-up to face Scotland. He had contemplated changes after the poor opening against Ireland when Wales trailed 13-0 after 28 minutes.
""We debated whether we'd make some changes particularly with a six-day turnaround,"" he said.
""But we felt that we hadn't started well so there's an opportunity in terms of those players that started the game last weekend to make sure they start the game well this weekend.
""We could have started with some of those players on the bench, but we felt there was a chance in terms giving them another chance to go and potentially put things right.""
Wales have not lost a game against Scotland under Gatland, with their last defeat coming in 2007 in Edinburgh.
The Scots have not won in Cardiff since 2002, but Gatland dismissed the notion there is a gulf between the teams.
""A lot of those matches have been very close,"" he said. ""And in a couple of them we got out of jail.

Pakistan are 146-3 after day three and have a lead of 74 runs over England, who must win to avoid a series defeat.
""We're confident in chasing whatever target they set us,"" Taylor, 25, told BBC Sport.
""The wicket is playing better than it has done all game and everyone can see that we are playing spin a lot better.""
England have the disadvantage of batting last on a pitch that has offered assistance to the spin bowlers throughout, with Pakistan's slow bowlers taking eight wickets between them in England's first-innings total of 306 all out.
""It's close,"" former England captain Michael Vaughan told BBC Test Match Special. ""It is on an edge but I would still prefer the runs on the board.
""I would prefer to be in Pakistan's dressing room now - but only just.""
Pakistan looked set to take control on day three when a century stand between Mohammad Hafeez and Azhar Ali wiped out England's first-innings lead of 72.
But three wickets in the evening session, including one each to the excellent pace pair of James Anderson and Stuart Broad, dragged the tourists back into contention.
Taylor, who made 76 on his recall to the Test side after a three-year absence, added: ""I think it's firmly in the balance.
""The way Jimmy and Broady bowled was unbelievable. They showed a lot of character and discipline and got their rewards.

"Trevor Gray was jailed in May 2012 for attacking a woman in her home, but then cleared last month after a retrial.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it was examining whether steps were taken to identify and locate significant witnesses.
Nottinghamshire Police said it ""fully supported"" the IPCC's investigation.
In 2012, Mr Gray, 49, was found guilty of rape, attempted rape and sexual touching. He was given an eight-year jail sentence.
Mr Gray appealed against the decision on the grounds police had failed to locate a significant witness who would have assisted his defence.
At the appeal hearing, evidence from a witness traced by Mr Gray's wife Alison led to the conviction being quashed.
A retrial was ordered at which Mr Gray was found not guilty of all charges.
Mr Gray said he found it difficult to understand why the witness had been overlooked by police.
IPCC Commissioner Derrick Campbell said: ""Where justice has not been properly served, there are many victims.
""Our investigation will look at whether Nottinghamshire Police properly and thoroughly followed all lines of inquiry into this matter.
""It will also look at whether there are lessons for Nottinghamshire Police to learn from these events.""
The IPCC added it would also look at what information was given to the Crown Prosecution Service.
The Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, condemned the original investigation.
Phil Matthews, from the Federation, had previously said it ""beggars belief"" that a vital witness who was not traced by police was found by Mr Gray's wife in four days.

"Deputy Darren Duquemin suggested rebranding as ""Guernsey Air"" would be more effective in promoting the island.
Deputy Treasury Minister Jan Kuttelwascher said it would be discussed by the Treasury Department, the company's shareholder, on Tuesday.
Mark Darby, the airline's chief executive officer, said changing the airline's 45-year-old name was not currently among their priorities.
This week the States accounts revealed the airline's debts had grown to Â£12m by the end of 2012.
They also showed the States was guaranteeing a loan of Â£14.9m for the purchase of two aircraft and a separate Â£7.8m loan for the Aurigny Group, which is the airline and an aero engineering company.
Deputy Kuttelwascher, a former airline pilot, said the idea was discussed during the last term of government but did not receive much support.
""I'm neutral on the issue,"" he said. ""It's primarily an operational issue for [Aurigny] to decide.
""In the current climate and Aurigny's financial situation, to try to put forward a business case which is acceptable for an expenditure which may or may not result in a benefit would not be an easy thing to do.""
Deputy Duquemin said changing stationery and livery would not cost much and the change would ultimately benefit the Bailiwick.
He said: ""If we can put 'Guernsey' in big letters on the side of a big, shiny new jet at Gatwick airport... people are going to be impressed that Guernsey has its own airline.""
""At the moment, it's almost the island's best kept secret,"" he said.
He said the rebrand could happen with routine maintenance over a number of years, rather than happening ""in one go"".
Mark Darby, the airline's chief executive officer, said: ""A name change would involve a large investment to rebrand all our aircraft, signage, websites, uniforms, stationery and marketing and there would be re-launch costs too.""
He said the idea would ""require careful thought by our board and consultation with our shareholder"".
Aurigny was purchased by the States in 2003, in order to secure slots at Gatwick and secure the future of flights to and from Guernsey.

"US composer Dan Messe will write the score for a new musical adaptation of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's movie, according to the Facebook page of his band, Hem.
Messe will collaborate with playwright Craig Lucas and composer Nathan Tysen.
Amelie tells the story of a shy waitress who sets out from Paris' Montmartre district on a mission to make others happy.
The film, which sold 8.6m tickets in France and earned $152m (Â£97m) worldwide, cast a nostalgic eye on contemporary Paris and catapulted Tautou to stardom.
Messe confirmed his role in the project after several leaks in the media.
""So not the best kept secret, but still I'm happy to announce that I've been commissioned to adapt the film Amelie for Broadway,"" he wrote on Facebook.
A fan of the film for many years, Messe told Paste Magazine that Hem's 2007 song Half Asleep was influenced by a scene from the movie.
""I wrote that imagining that scene where Amelie and Nino are speaking between the door,"" he says, ""So I'd already written a song for those characters, but then it took years and years to get the rights.""

"They increase borrowing powers for Wales and allow Welsh and UK ministers to reach legal agreement on water flowing across the border with England.
Changes under the Wales Act also mean the assembly could change its name to Welsh Parliament if members wished.
But some AMs have said the legislation claws back powers in some areas.
In November, Mr Cairns described ending his ability to block some laws made in Wales about water as putting right a ""long outstanding injustice"" 50 years after the flooding of a Gwynedd village to create the Tryweryn reservoir to supply Liverpool.
The Welsh Government can now borrow up to Â£1bn for infrastructure projects, rather than the current Â£500m.
Other measures in the act that now apply include the reaffirming of the assembly and Welsh Government as permanent features of the British political landscape.
It also enshrines the convention that Westminster will not normally pass laws on devolved matters without permission from AMs.
""From today, the assembly can decide on a new title if that's what assembly members want,"" Mr Cairns said.
""I and my successors will no longer be entitled to a seat in the assembly, nor will we be required to give an annual address to the assembly on the Queen's Speech.
""Together, these changes reflect the coming of age of the devolved institutions in Wales and mark the beginning of the transition to the new settlement that the Wales Act will put in place.""
The powers came into force automatically on Friday, two months after the Wales Bill received Royal Assent on 31 January.
The date when many of the act's other provisions will take effect has not yet been decided.
They include changing the way the assembly's powers are defined to a ""reserved powers"" model.
This would specify what Westminster controls, with everything else assumed to be the responsibility of Cardiff Bay,
The current system lists what is a matter for the assembly, with other powers deemed to belong to the UK Parliament.
Some Welsh politicians have claimed the reserved powers model actually rolls back devolution in some areas.

"Shinzo Abe said he wanted to ""build trust"" and ""work together for prosperity and world peace"", before leaving for his trip.
The meeting in New York comes amid concern over the foreign policy direction of Tokyo's biggest ally.
Mr Trump has said Japan needs to pay more to maintain US troops on its soil.
He also condemned a major trade deal struck by President Obama with Japan and other Pacific Rim countries.
The US and Japan have been key allies since the end of World War Two, when the US helped Japan rebuild its economy.
Mr Abe is stopping in New York on his way to an Asia-Pacific trade summit in Peru.
But details of Thursday's meeting are unclear, with a Japanese official saying exactly where it will happen has not been firmed up.
""There has been a lot of confusion,"" a Japanese official told Reuters news agency.
The BBC's Paul Adams in Washington says Mr Trump has toned down some of his more strident rhetoric since the election, but that hasn't stopped observers wondering whether the fundamentals of post-war US policy on Asia can survive.
Mr Trump has also yet to select his new cabinet and other positions. He has denied that the transition to the White House is in a disarray.
Mr Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have spoken with 29 world leaders since the election, according to a statement from the transition team.
It remains unclear who else might be at the meeting with Mr Abe.
High-level talks are rarely held in such an informal context and Tokyo is keen to minimise uncertainty during the long handover of power.
""We want to safeguard our alliance with the United States during the transition,"" said a senior Japanese foreign ministry official, Tetsuya Otsuru, when the meeting was announced.
But there are some key points of difference between the two countries.
Donald Trump has suggested the US could pull troops out if Japan does not start paying more for them. Tokyo currently spends $1.7bn (Â£1.3bn) on their support, including the costs of running US bases, which are unpopular with many in Okinawa where most are located.
The president-elect also stunned Japan on the campaign trail by floating the idea that it and South Korea might be better off acquiring nuclear weapons to protect themselves against North Korea.
Japan, the only country to have had nuclear weapons used against it, has a pacifist constitution and is resolutely opposed to arming itself with nuclear weapons.
China
Both men distrust Beijing, but the focus of their concern is different. Mr Trump accuses China of engaging in the biggest ""theft"" of US jobs in history, by exploiting ""terrible"" trade deals he will renegotiate or rip up. For Mr Abe the main concern is likely to be Beijing's increasingly aggressive tone towards territory Japan controls but which China also claims.
Japan is an export-led economy, heavily dependent on trade. It needs the US to stay open to its products and to back trade deals that keep other countries open to them too. Mr Trump has expressed concerns about Japanese imports and has promised to ditch the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, even though many saw it as a way to contain China, which is working on a rival deal.","Japan's PM is set to become the first foreign leader to meet US President-elect Donald Trump, since the election last week.",37946613

"Samia Shahid, 28, from Bradford, was strangled last month in Northern Punjab, police in Pakistan said.
Cleric Syed Sibtami Kazmi said he was ""threatened"" after Ms Shahid's second marriage in September 2014.
Her second husband Syed Mukhtar Kazam believes she was killed because her family disapproved of their marriage.
Ms Shahid's family claims she died from natural causes.
Mr Kazmi, a prayer leader at Anjuman-e-Haideria, a Shia mosque in Bradford, said Ms Shahid approached him in May 2014 seeking an Islamic divorce from her first husband Choudhry Shakeel.
""She told me under oath that her first marriage was a forced marriage, which happened without her free will as she was pressurised into the marriage by her family,"" he said.
She was accompanied by two witnesses who signed her divorce papers.
Mr Kazmi said after writing to her first husband, who declined to give his version of events, he declared the marriage void.
He also performed the religious ceremony for Ms Shahid to marry her second husband.
Ms Shahid converted to her new husband's Shia denomination of Islam prior to her second marriage, although her family are Sunni.
The cleric said that once the Shahid family became aware of the marriage they contacted him for clarification.
He said he expressed ignorance so as not to compromise Ms Shahid's safety and, some months later, he received a threatening call from a family member.
Mr Kazmi quoted an unnamed member of her family as saying: ""(Ms Shahid) is missing from home and you know where she is. The issue will be resolved but you will have to pay a high price for your role.""
The cleric said: ""I recorded all these threats and handed them over to police without any delay.""
He said on the basis of his complaint the police spoke to the family and officers had given him safety advice.
The prayer leader said he initially went to the police station to lodge his complaint and police visited him later.
""It was a long process which continued from two to three months,"" he said, adding that apart from these two visits there were numerous contacts on telephone and text messages.
Mr Kazam confirmed to the BBC he was aware of Mr Kazmi's claim and that both he and his wife had also been threatened by a member of Ms Shahid's family around the same time.
Ms Shahid's family could not be contacted for comment, but have previously said she died of a heart attack.
West Yorkshire Police said it was reviewing the case.
""Her death remains a matter for the Pakistani authorities and we are continuing to liaise with them and with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office,"" the force said.

Work is expected to take up to three years to complete, and will begin in late 2018.

Most of the 17 people charged are still at large, including gang leader Dairo Antonio Usuga David, known as Otoniel.
The United States says it will try to secure the extradition of the alleged Clan Usuga members.
The announcement of the indictments was made by President Juan Manuel Santos in Bogota, at a joint media conference with American officials.
""We will continue to act strongly against these criminals who poison our youth, who sow violence, who promote corruption not only in Colombia but across the world,"" said Mr Santos.
The US has previously offered up to $5m (Â£3.4m) for information leading to Otoniel's arrest.
Otoniel has been in charge since his brother, Juan de Dios, was killed on 1 January 2012 when police raided his New Year's Eve party.
The gang is mainly engaged in drug trafficking, but it has also been accused of extortion, illegal mining, forced disappearances and murder, says the BBC's Natalio Cosoy in Bogota.
Colombian police estimate the gang has some 2,000 active members.
Over the past five years, the security forces have captured 6,700 members of the group.
""Your operatives will continue to be dismantled; they will be captured and your government, our ally in Colombia, will work with us to secure your extradition,"" said Wifredo Ferrer, US attorney for the Southern District of Florida at the presidential palace in Bogota.

"Former Wales midfielder Trollope, 43, had been part of Slade's coaching team since February 2015.
Slade was removed as manager of the Championship club at the end of the season and has taken up a new role as head of football, in which he will oversee scouting, among other duties.
""We have to be ambitious and create a belief within the club,"" Trollope said.
""The target is the play-offs and hopefully promotion.""
Trollope, in his new role in charge of the first-team, will not report to predecessor Slade.

""There are areas that need addressing within the team and we will be looking to add quality and also the right people,"" added Trollope.
""I had no reservations, it is a good club with a good fan base.
""Every coach has own philosophies and way of doing things. I have clear ideas what I want. I will bring my own style to that. Anyone who knows me will know that.""
Malaysian businessman Vincent Tan is prioritising style and promotion.
In a statement on the club's website he said: ""I believe Paul will improve the team in several areas. In particular, I hope he will lead the team to play an attractive style of football that Cardiff City fans love.
""We hope that under Paul's leadership, Cardiff City will return to the Premier League.
""I'd like to thank him for what he's done for us so far whilst wishing him the best of luck for the future. He has our full support.""

"Ryan Lock, 20, from Chichester in West Sussex, died fighting alongside Kurdish forces near Raqqa on 21 December.
It is believed he turned a gun on himself to avoid being taken hostage.
Dozens of people, including members of the Kurdish community, held roses and framed pictures of him, as his coffin arrived at Heathrow Airport.
The former chef, who had no previous military experience, joined the Kurdish armed fighting forces, the YPG, after telling his family he was going on holiday to Turkey in August.
The YPG told the BBC that ""trace of a gunshot wound was found under the chin"", suggesting suicide.
Staff at Heathrow were rather caught off guard as Ryan Lock's body arrived home.
No-one at the cargo bay of Royal Jordanian Airlines expected to see a crowd of mourners arriving on their forecourt.
With just a couple of hours notice, Kurds young and old turned out to pay tribute to a man from Chichester whom they had never met.
""This is not just a foreign war, this is a fight for humanity"", one told me.
""International solidarity"" they chant as they place flowers over the private ambulance carrying Ryan Lock's coffin.

"The move in Chorley means supplies in all areas south of the River Ribble are back to normal, while 100,000 homes are still affected, United Utilities said.
Up to 300,000 homeowners had to boil drinking water for more than three weeks after cryptosporidium, a microbial parasite, was discovered.
The bug was found at a treatment works near Preston on 6 August.
Water has been treated with ultraviolet (UV) light to kill the bug, which can cause diarrhoea and cramps.
United Utilities said it expected to be able to lift the restrictions for the ""vast majority of remaining customers"" by the end of Sunday.

"SNP Treasury spokesman Stewart Hosie hit out at ""metropolitan sneering"" by some journalists ahead of the vote.
But shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said the campaign for independence was looking for someone to blame in the event of a ""No"" result.
The exchanges came during a BBC Scotland TV debate from Stirling.
The debate came on the day a large crowd gathered outside BBC Scotland's Glasgow HQ to say its coverage was biased against independence.
The broadcaster said it believed its coverage had been fair and impartial.
Mr Hosie said output such as the TV debate in which he was appearing had shown ""impeccable balance"", adding: ""However, we then get the metropolitan sneering of certain journalists.""
'Reaching decisions'
The SNP MP added: ""There are people who I know are voting, senior people who have not declared, who are now likely to declare publically because of their absolute outrage at the way in which certain parts of the media have chosen to portray this debate.""
Mr Alexander, a Scottish Labour MP and member of the Better Together campaign to keep the Union, said of the claims: ""What we've seen is another example of dog whistle nationalism.
On the ""Yes"" campaign, he added: ""They want , after they lose on Thursday, to be able to say it was London-based newspapers, it was the BBC.
""We are smarter than that as Scots - we are reaching our own decisions.""
Also appearing on the programme, actress and independence supporter Elaine C Smith said ""The fact that we are actually neck-and-neck in the polls is nigh on a miracle I think at the moment, given one Sunday newspaper in Scotland - the Sunday Herald - has come out in favour of independence, and even then only a couple of months ago.

"Some officers were given a standing authority to carry guns following the creation of a single Scottish force.
The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla) agreed to the principle that officers should not carry firearms on regular duties.
A report criticised a lack of consultation and the effect on the public's perception of the force.
Strathclyde Police, Tayside Police and Northern Constabulary allowed specialist officers to carry guns on routine patrol before the creation of the new single force.
The approach was adopted across the country in April last year.
Earlier this year by independent MSP and former Northern Constabulary officer John Finnie raised concerns about the rollout of the policy.
Highland councillors have also questioned the deployment of officers visibly carrying handguns in routine incidents in a region with low levels of violent crime.
The Cosla report, backed unanimously by council leaders meeting in Edinburgh, invited them to agree ""to the principle that police officers should not carry firearms on regular duties"".
It also asked leaders to agree to write to Police Scotland to seek clarification and respond to three separate reviews of the policy being carried out by Police Scotland, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland and the Scottish Police Authority.
The report accepts that the deployment of armed officers is an operational matter decided by the chief constable.
But it notes that there is ""no clear recourse for local government, or indeed Scottish government, to hold the chief constable to account"" if there is dissatisfaction.
It also suggests inviting Police Scotland Chief Constable Sir Stephen House to a meeting with council leaders.
Police Scotland has said that it has 275 firearms officers - 1.6% of the force's personnel - and they are deployed on a shift pattern basis.
For every 1,000 officers there will be 10 officers armed and on shift.
These specialist officers carry a Taser stun gun and a holstered handgun.
A Scottish Government spokesman said: ""Decisions on the use of resources, including armed police officers, are clearly a matter for the Chief Constable of Police Scotland.
""However, it is important there is appropriate oversight to ensure transparency in decision making and to reassure the public and Parliament, which is why scrutiny of Police Scotland is in place through the statutory role of the SPA as well as the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner and HMICS.
""In addition, the Parliament's Justice Sub-Committee on Policing is able to scrutinise all aspects of policing in Scotland and is currently looking at the issue of armed policing in more detail.""",Council leaders have opposed the policy of allowing police officers to carry guns while on routine patrol.,29362166

Assistant manager Keane has told the players to be prepared to ""take out"" an opponent if needed, in a game they must win to reach the knockout stages.
""My advice would probably be, yes, take him out,"" he said.
""We saw Italy do it against Belgium - a player did it on the halfway line and got a yellow card.""
The Republic are hoping striker Jon Walters may be fit to start after being dogged by an Achilles problem.
Keane has called for drastic action from the players to avoid a repeat of Saturday's 3-0 defeat by Belgium, which has left them struggling to make the last 16.
It's not a crime. You might get a yellow card - you might even get a red - but your team might win.
It was the nature of the defeat in Bordeaux which disappointed former national team captain Keane, with missed tackles by James McCarthy and Ciaran Clark contributing to both of Romelu Lukaku's goals.
Keane said: ""We're not here to make friends - the fans are doing that.
""You have got to be streetwise in this game.
""But from the players' point of view, if you smell danger, if you can hold the player up and you can win the ball, fantastic.
""But if you think, 'We're in trouble here', then yes, you do whatever you can to get the right result and if that's fouling, then you foul.
""It's not a crime. You might get a yellow card - you might even get a red - but your team might win.""
Stoke City striker Walters started the Republic's 1-1 draw with Sweden in the Stade de France but was substituted after 64 minutes when his Achilles problem flared up again.
He was then forced to sit out the Belgium game altogether.
""Hopefully he can do something. It's still very much touch and go,"" said Keane at Monday's press conference at the team's base in Versailles.
""If you speak to the player, he's improving every day but the game is coming up quickly.""
Walters has scored 10 times in 40 appearances for his country and Keane added: ""We know the type of lad Jon is and I think if there's any chance he thinks he can get through it he'll have a go"".
""Even if we managed to get Jon on the pitch for an hour, it'd be fantastic.
""Of course, you have to look after the player's welfare - if he doesn't feel right, it's highly unlikely he'll be involved.""

Over a series of qualifying heats, riders have to navigate a course full of humps, bumps and jumps while trying to outmanoeuvre - and avoid crashing into - their opponents.
The drama is heightened by a winner-takes-all, one-run final.
BMX has come along way from the skate parks and dirt roads it was first popularised on in Britain in the 1980s.
Anyone looking to replicate the competitors' adrenaline-fuelled moves can do so on the Olympic Park: the track is being reopened to the public.
The effort of riding a BMX bike at speed for an hour can burn approximately 610 calories. This not only helps aid weight loss but increases endurance, promotes agility, develops physical coordination and builds muscle strength.
Pedalling a BMX bike strengthens and tones various leg muscles, while lifting the handlebars to perform tricks can increase muscle mass in the biceps and triceps.
Whether practising to compete in races or perform tricks, BMX boosts self-discipline, motivation, self-esteem and confidence.
Training sessions are an excellent way to develop communication skills and learn to work effectively with other people. Clubs also offer a variety of social events beyond simply taking part in the sport.
There are currently more than 50 dedicated BMX tracks throughout the UK. Find your local club by using British Cycling's club finder.
It is essential to wear safety equipment such as a full-face helmet, cycling gloves and elbow and knee pads. It is recommended that trousers and a long sleeved top be worn for added protection.
For people looking to try out the sport, you can hire BMX bikes, gloves and helmets from tracks throughout the country. Good quality starter bikes can also be purchased at around £200-300.
Club membership often entitles people to receive coaching and equipment hire at reduced rates, plus entry to in-house races.
Training days and taster schemes are run for people of all ages and abilities throughout the year. Visit the British Cycling, Cycling Ireland, Scottish Cycling and Welsh Cycling websites for more information.
For regional and national events, membership of British Cycling or Cycling Ireland is required. There are a number of bands related to how regularly you wish to compete.
Small race fees are also often required to take part in meets.
For parents looking to get their children started in competitive racing, British Cycling are running a number of events for under-16s throughout the United Kingdom this year. Visit the Go-Ride Racing website for more details.
BMX racing can trace its origins back to the early 1970s when children, taking inspiration from the motorcross superstars of the time, started competing on dirt tracks on their pedal bikes in southern California.
The Oscar-nominated 1971 documentary 'On Any Sunday', featuring Steve McQueen, which opens with kids imitating motorcyclists by riding their bikes on a dirt track, is widely credited with popularising the nascent BMX across the USA.
It steadily grew in popularity and by the mid-point of that decade people were racing standard road bikes off-road, around purpose-built tracks throughout the state.
Manufacturers soon latched on to its growing status, and specifically modified BMX bikes began to be mass produced.
George Esser set up BMX's first sanctioning organisation, the National Bicycle League, in 1974. Three years later, the American Bicycle Association was formed to help with governance, with the International BMX Federation following in 1981.
BMX World Championships have been held since 1982 and the sport has featured prominently at the extreme sports event, the X Games.
BMX became the most recent cycling discipline added to the Olympic programme when it was introduced at Beijing 2008.

Apple is charging $149 in the USA for the service that will only be available on phones that are ""in working order"".
In a statement on its website, Apple said it had ""determined"" that displays on some iPhone 6 Plus handsets flickered or became unresponsive if the device was dropped several times on a hard surface and was then subjected to ""further stress"".

Apple said that customers who had already paid to get their phone cured of ""touch disease"" should get in touch to be repaid for the amount they spent beyond the programme fee.
The repair programme will run for five years beyond the initial date on which the iPhone 6 Plus went on sale, said Apple.
Stuart Miles, founder of gadget news site Pocket-lint, said: ""I think if it's a known defect that isn't caused by the user then it should be the responsibility of Apple to fix the phone free of charge regardless of the age.""

In a blogpost about the problem posted in August, iFixit said there were ""pages and pages"" of messages from aggrieved iPhone 6 Plus owners on the Apple support site complaining about the fault.
An investigation by iFixit and specialist repair shops found the cause of the fault was the placement of the touchscreen controller chip.

"Eight people died in a 2009 militant attack on the Sri Lankan team in Lahore, which ended international cricket tours to Pakistan.
But Sunday's test of a major match - the Pakistan Super League Twenty20 final - ended without incident.
Thousands of troops, backed by air support, patrolled the area.
Since the 2009 attacks, Pakistan has played its home games in other venues, such as the United Arab Emirates, as foreign teams refused to tour the country.
A rare exception in 2015, with the Zimbabwean team, was marred by a fatal suicide bombing outside the Lahore stadium.
Even the Pakistan Super League itself - which drafts foreign players - has been played in UAE, with Sunday's final being its first true home game.
Several international players dropped out of Sunday's final over security fears.
But among those who chose to play was West Indian Darren Sammy, who led Peshawar Zalmi to victory.
Sammy's fellow West Indian, Marlon Samuels, and Englishmen Chris Jordan and Dawid Malan also played.
""I felt tonight I brought a lot of smiles in Lahore and Peshawar,"" Sammy told the Associated Press in the sold-out stadium. ""I am glad I came to experience the atmosphere here.""
His team easily defeated rivals Quetta Gladiators, but the result is seen as less important than the peaceful conclusion of the event.
Militant attacks in February killed 130 people - the worst spell of violence in years - and sparked fresh concerns over the ability to provide security at a high-profile sporting event.
The venue, Gaddafi stadium, was the same as the scheduled game eight years ago, before the Sri Lanka team was attacked en route.

"They say a long-term census of mammals in the area has shown that wildlife numbers are likely to be ""much higher than they were before the accident"".
Professor Jim Smith of the University of Portsmouth led the study, published in the journal Current Biology.
He stressed that this ""does not mean that radiation is good for wildlife"".
""It's just that the effects of human habitation, including hunting, farming, and forestry, are a lot worse,"" Prof Smith said.
With the help of with colleagues from the Polesky State Radioecological Reserve in Belarus, the researchers examined data from aerial surveys that counted large mammals including roe deer, elk, wild boar and wolves.
They also carried out tracking studies in the winter - using footprints in snow to calculate the numbers of different mammal species. And measuring the levels of radioactive contamination in those tracks.
""The numbers of animals we see in Chernobyl is similar to the populations in uncontaminated nature reserves,"" Prof Smith said.
The number of wolves was particularly striking - up to seven times higher than in nearby nature reserves of a comparable size. Prof Smith attributed this to the lack of hunting in the exclusion zone.
A 30km exclusion zone now surrounds the infamous Chernobyl nuclear power plant. And Prof Smith says the picture from this study reveals what happens in terms of wildlife conservation ""when you take humans out of the picture"".
But, he said, the study did not look at the health effects of radiation on individual animals.
That is something that Prof Tim Mousseau from the University of South Carolina, has spent many years trying to unpick in his studies of wildlife - particularly bird populations - in the exclusion zone.
Prof Mousseau said the study was a ""very positive move forward in conducting research concerning the potential health and environmental impacts of nuclear accidents"".
""Much more research on this is desperately needed,"" he added.
But Prof Mousseau is also troubled by ""the characterisation that Chernobyl and the surrounding area is teeming with wildlife"".
""This study only applies to large mammals under hunting pressure, rather than the vast majority of animals - most birds, small mammals, and insects - that are not directly influenced by human habitation,"" he told BBC News.
In their study of mammal tracks, however, Prof Smith and his colleagues did compare the abundance of animals in different areas of the exclusion zone. They found that more contaminated areas had just as many animals as less contaminated sites.
Prof Mousseau said that the study simply showed that, ""if left unchecked, some populations of animals will grow exponentially and eventually overpopulate a region"".
""There is no evidence that the animals of Chernobyl are achieving the levels of population growth that are frequently seen in other regions where they are protected from predation or hunting,"" he added.","Removing humans from what is now the exclusion zone around the damaged Chernobyl nuclear reactor has allowed wildlife to return, researchers say.",34414914

Harrison took a hat-trick of wins over the course of the meeting, with Dunlop also securing a treble of victories.
Harrison, Dunlop and BMW pilot Kneen each enjoyed spells at the front as they traded positions regularly throughout the feature event.
""I've been trying to win that race for five years and I'm over the moon,"" said Bradford man Harrison after his 'big race' success.
""Everyone is pushing really hard so it's a hard race to win. The lead swapped and changed a few times but I just kept braking as late as I could and kept the head down.
""I had some bad luck issues with the bike over the last few days and missed two races but this makes it all worthwhile,"" added the Yorkshire rider.
Earlier in the day, Dunlop, 28, surpassed the previous best lap benchmark with a speed of 115.267 in winning a keenly fought Senior race.
The Ballymoney man enjoyed an advantage of less than a second over Kneen at the chequered flag, with Jamie Coward completing the podium, some 25 seconds behind Dunlop.
Dunlop also narrowly saw off Kneen in Tuesday's opening 1000cc race and continued his fine form by winning Wednesday's seven-lap Senior race.
Harrison won the 600cc opener on Wednesday and then got the better of runner-up Dunlop and third-place finisher Cowton in the second event for that class on Thursday, Dunlop having the consolation of a new lap record at 111.335.
Ivan Lintin took a slender triumph over Cowton in Thursday's Supertwins outing to complete a double in that class, Rob Hodson occupying the final rostrum position.
Ballymoney's Darryl Tweed made it two wins from two by ending 5.6 seconds in front of Seamus Elliott in the 400cc/125cc, with Paul Gartland third.

"Natalia Doherty, 50, a mother-of-three, was last seen in Eastbourne, East Sussex, in April 2003, prompting a murder inquiry.
Police have been searching the garden of a house in Icknield Way, Luton.
Two men, aged 66 and 39, from Luton, have been arrested on suspicion of murder and are in police custody.
Updates on this story and others from Bedfordshire
Police said early indications suggested that the remains were those of a female, but no formal identification had taken place.
The older man had previously been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender and preventing a lawful burial.
'Skeletal remains'
A 71-year-old man from Port Glasgow, Scotland, is on bail on suspicion of the same crimes.
Det Insp Jerry Waite, of the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit, said recent inquiries had led them to the garden.
""Police have been working here since last Monday, where we have been conducting ground survey work and we have discovered the skeletal remains of a person,"" he said.
""As yet there appears to be no formal identification, but we have informed the family of Natalia Doherty that we believe it could be her and we are supporting them.
""Due to the intelligence we had, we strongly believed Natalia would be here.""
Detectives believe that shortly before her death, Ms Doherty travelled to Luton to stay with her late ex-husband, Gerald, at the Regents Arms in Hastings Street.
Det Insp Waite said he wanted to hear from anyone who knew the pair around the time of the last confirmed sighting of Ms Doherty on 15 April 2003.
""We would appeal for them to come forward - especially if they knew them in or around 2003 - and were aware of them being in Luton during February to April 2003,"" he said.",Human remains have been found in a garden by police investigating the disappearance of a woman who went missing 12 years ago.,35051816

As of next term, a Football Association panel will review footage each Monday looking for cases and any player found unanimously guilty would be banned.
Webb says that the football authorities ""need to shift the balance"" on diving.
""The risk/reward for players to dive is not in the right place,"" he said.
""If a player is thinking 'if I hit the deck I can get away with it and get a penalty and if I get caught I get a yellow card' that is not much of a deterrent. This new measure will be hopefully.""
The FA says it will act ""where there is clear and overwhelming evidence to suggest a match official has been deceived by an act of simulation"".
But only incidents that result in a player winning a penalty or lead to an opponent being sent off - through either a direct red card or two yellow cards - will be punished.
The panel will consist of one former match official, one ex-manager and one ex-player.
Webb, who is overseeing the introduction of video refereeing in Major League Soccer, explained that retrospective suspensions for simulation already occur in the US.
He told BBC Radio 5 live's Friday Football Social: ""On a Monday morning, the disciplinary committee look at all the controversial plays from the weekend.
""If they involve simulation then - providing the five-man panel are unanimous - that player will then get suspended.
""It works. Players come here knowing that if they dive and got away with it on the day they will pay the price later down the road.""

"The 40-year-old was detained on suspicion of attempted murder after one shooting left a man with a leg injury.
Two shots were fired from a moving car at a cyclist outside St Edmund's primary school in Rosebery Street on 21 June, but nobody was hurt, police said.
A man, 32, suffered the leg wound in another drive-by shooting two days earlier in Western Road, Winson Green.
Officers executed a warrant at a flat in Selwyn Road in the Winson Green area just before 05:30 BST, the West Midlands force said.
A vehicle parked near Selwyn Road has been seized for forensic examination while searches are ongoing at another address in Birmingham connected to the suspect.
Detectives are still searching for the cyclist who is believed to have been the intended target of the Rosebery Street shooting.

"Official figures show that £7.7bn has been raised from stamp duty land tax (SDLT) during the first eight months of the 2016-17 financial year.
That is 12% more than was raised during the same period the year before.
But this has come despite a 10% drop in the number of homes being sold in the UK.
Between April and November this year, 782,000 homes were sold, down from the 868,000 sold in the same eight months of the previous financial year.
Even if that trend continues, the exchequer's revenue from stamp duty may still exceed the previous record of £10.7bn raised during 2015-16.
The increased tax take reflects two big changes to stamp duty in the past two years, as well as the impact of the continued rise in average house prices, which have gone up by 7% in the past year.
In December 2014, the whole SDLT system was overhauled and new tax rates were brought in.
These range from 0% on homes worth £125,000 or less, up to 12% on the top slice of homes worth more than £1.5m.
The overall effect of the new system is that stamp duty has been cut for the 95% of buyers who buy homes worth less than £1m, but has been raised for those buying more expensive properties.
Then, in April this year, a SDLT surcharge was brought in for anyone buying a second home.
This added a further three percentage points to the rates they would have otherwise paid.
Property commentator Henry Pryor said these changes were now depressing the number of transactions at the top end of the market.
And he warned this might eventually feed into the government's tax take.
""While there has been a direct impact on transactions at the top of the market, there is as yet no evidence to support those who have been calling for the chancellor to rethink the rates applicable to buyers of the most expensive properties,"" he said.
""But estate agents estimate that more than 40% of SDLT revenue comes from within the M25.
""And the number of all transactions in London was, in August, 39% down on a year ago, so this will inevitably create a hole in the chancellor's accounts in due course.""
Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, said: ""Buy-to-let investors will understandably feel aggrieved at the stamp duty surcharge they now face, but their calls for April's increase to be reversed are likely to fall on deaf ears.""","The UK government is on track to raise a record amount of tax from property sales, despite a fall in the number of home sales.",38391971
"It came after the UK defence secretary told BBC Scotland that the SNP should ""forget"" about holding a second referendum.
But Sir Michael Fallon would not be drawn on reports he had suggested the UK government would block a vote.
SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that Sir Michael had ""seriously backpedalled"" on the issue.
A spokeswoman for Prime Minister Theresa May later said that the referendum in 2014, when Scotland voted by 55% to 45% to remain in the UK, was ""legal, fair and decisive"".
She added: ""We believe that this issue was settled in 2014. Recent polls don't suggest that there has been a big change in the views around a second referendum.""
The Scottish first minister has said another independence referendum was increasingly likely in the wake of the Brexit vote, but she would need the UK government's permission in order to hold a second legally binding vote.
Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Sir Michael said the SNP ""need to forget all that stuff and get on with what they were elected to do.""
But he did not directly answer questions on whether or not the UK government would allow a vote.
He said: ""We don't see the need for a referendum - this is a diversion.
""What the Scottish government should be focusing on is what it was elected to do, which is to improve schools standards, get to grips with the problems in Scottish hospitals and reverse the serious rise in unemployment.""
The minister urged the SNP to focus on their ""day job"" and ""not get into the theology of whether or not a second referendum should be held"".
The Herald newspaper said it had asked Sir Michael whether the UK government would facilitate a referendum during the lifetime of this parliament.
It quoted the Conservative politician as replying: ""No, forget it. The respect agenda is two way.
""She [Ms Sturgeon] is constantly asking us to respect the SNP government, but she has to respect the decision of the Scotland to stay inside the UK in 2014 and the decision of the UK to leave the EU.
""Respect works both ways.""
Sir Michael was speaking ahead of a visit to Midlothian engineering firm MacTaggart Scott designs, at which he said the Treasury had approved the initial business case for a training school for naval crews working on the UK's nuclear submarines.
The submarine school would be built at the Faslane naval base on the Clyde, which will be home to all 11 Royal Navy submarines from 2020 in a move which will see the number of people employed there rise from 6,800 to 8,200.
Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson opposes a second referendum being held - but said last year that she did not believe the UK government should block one.
The UK government White Paper setting out its Brexit plans pledges to ""ensure that more decisions are devolved"" after the UK leaves the EU.
But while the government will ""champion devolution"", it stressed there would be a ""whole UK"" approach to the Brexit negotiations.
Ms Sturgeon tweeted that there had been ""serious backpedalling from Michael Fallon on GMS on blocking #indyref2"" and that he ""must have realised what a disastrous move it would be for Tories.""
She later told Holyrood: ""If this parliament voted to have a referendum on independence, then absolutely I agree that no Westminster Tory should stand in the way of the voice of this parliament.
""The mandate of this government in relation to this is unequivocal - it was the Tories after all who put us in the position of being taken out of the European Union against our will, and with the support of only one of the 59 MPs in this country.

"Tim Farron is expected to say outgoing UKIP leader Nigel Farage and French far-right leader Marine Le Pen should not be allowed to ""dictate our policy"".
He is also expected to call for protection for EU workers in the UK.
Ms Le Pen has welcomed the Brexit vote, but Mr Farage has previously rejected ties with her party.
The Liberal Democrats are committed to continuing to campaign for the UK's EU membership.
Mr Farron will tell the centre-left think tank the IPPR that the 23 June referendum has left the UK ""bitterly divided"" and ""we are in danger of letting malevolent forces hijack the result"".
He will tell his audience in Manchester: ""Plenty of my mates voted Leave, and I can tell you that the majority of those who did vote Leave are utterly appalled that Farage, Le Pen and their ilk now seek to claim the result as a victory for their hateful brand of intolerance, racism and insularity.

France's National Front leader, Marine Le Pen, has said the UK's Brexit vote was ""the most important moment since the fall of the Berlin Wall"".
She and a number of other far-right leaders in Europe say they would like to hold their own referendums on EU membership.
Mr Farage has always rejected similarities between UKIP and the National Front, accusing the French party of ""anti-Semitism and general prejudice"".
Ms Le Pen, in turn, has accused Mr Farage of ""aggression"" against her party, for labelling it racist.
In his Manchester speech, Mr Farron will also say that there is ""justified"" anger among voters because ""we have a political class, which I don't particularly like having to accept I'm a member of, which has abandoned people disastrously to their fate"".
He will add: ""We have a Treasury so cut off from reality that they urged people not to vote for Brexit because it might mean property prices would rise more slowly.
""As if people weren't struggling now to get a foot on the housing ladder.""
He will argue that the Leave vote has created ""new political boundaries which chop the old certainties of Tory and Labour into little pieces"" and there is now a battle ""between the forces of tolerant liberalism and intolerant, closed-minded nationalism"".
A majority of voters backed leaving the EU in the vote in June - but, within days, 10,000 new members had applied to join the Liberal Democrats.
The party campaigned for a Remain vote and, following the result, Mr Farron said he would campaign to keep the UK in the EU at the next general election.
Mr Farron is also expected to back giving people from other EU member states living and working in the UK the right to stay, saying: ""We can say to those from other countries who have committed their lives alongside us in the UK, 'We will stand by you, no matter what.'""

"It follows the apparent suicide in September of activist Elliott Johnson, who had claimed he was bullied by party youth organiser Mark Clarke.
Number 10 said the PM was awaiting the results of an internal investigation, but Mr Johnson's father has called for an independent and external inquiry.
Mr Clarke denies all the allegations.
Allegations of bullying, sexual assault and intimidation have engulfed the party since 21-year-old Mr Johnson was found dead in September.
Mr Cameron said it was a ""tragic loss of a talented young life"".
He said: ""I feel deeply for his parents it is an appalling loss to suffer... There needs to be and there is a proper inquiry where we ask all the questions, interview all the people who've come forward - that will take place.
He said an independent lawyer was overseeing the whole process to ""make sure it reaches clear conclusions from the evidence that comes through"".
His father, Ray Johnson, called for an external inquiry to be set up saying he believed the current investigation was ""a cover up"" and that he had no confidence in current party chairman Lord Feldman, who is conducting the inquiry.
He also called on Lord Feldman and former party chairman Grant Shapps to resign over claims they ignored repeated warnings about Mr Clarke - who was in charge of a campaigning initiative which bussed young volunteers around the country.
""I can't see how their inquiry can have any veracity at all... I complained that an inquiry run by themselves without independent oversight can't possibly be considered to be valid,"" he told BBC Newsnight.
""I want to get to the bottom of what happened to my son and I will fight for justice for him and for the other activists.""
The Conservative Party has said that it received no written complaints until this summer about Mr Clarke's behaviour.
However, former chairwoman Baroness Warsi says she wrote to Mr Shapps, her successor, in January asking for action to be taken against Mr Clarke.
Lady Warsi has published the letter containing her concerns in the Guardian. In it she complained that Mr Clarke had sent a tweet which implied she had offended a Jewish member of a local Conservative Party.
Mr Clarke has said Lady Warsi is pursuing a personal vendetta against him.
The BBC's Newsnight programme has also seen an email written by a young Conservative activist, sent to the party in July last year, that complains of threats at the hands of Mr Clarke. The activist says nothing was done with the complaint.
Earlier this month, Mr Clarke was banned for life from the Conservative Party.
He says he strongly refutes all allegations of bullying, harassment, assault or attempted blackmail.

"It was in that summer Dante Gabriel Rossetti met his muse, Jane Morris, who was Jane Burden at the time, and who came to embody the Pre-Raphaelite ideal of beauty.
And at the same time she met her future husband, Rossetti's friend William Morris.
For Harriet Drummond, curator at Christie's: ""The enduring popularity of Pre-Raphaelite images is underlined by the popularity of the images we see today reproduced on cards, calendars, posters and book covers.""
After passing down generations of his family, one of Rossetti's paintings of Jane Morris is now up for auction for the first time.
Proserpine, unfinished, was painted nearly two decades after they met, when they had become lovers.
Sitting alongside it in the auction is a far earlier picture.
Placing the two next to each other charts the tumultuous development of the relationship between painter and muse.
Over the summer of 1857 three Oxford undergraduates, Rossetti, Morris and Edward Burne-Jones, shared rooms in George Street.
They spent a hedonistic summer painting the Oxford Union debating chamber.
Rossetti and Burne-Jones spotted Jane at the theatre and asked her to become one of their models, who they nicknamed ""stunners"".
Ms Drummond said: ""It was over one summer holiday. They're literally at the beginning of their careers.""
Rossetti was already engaged to Lizzie Siddell, another great pre-Raphaelite beauty.
Jane married his friend William Morris, later to gain fame as a socialist writer and artist.
The poet Swinburne, also at Oxford, wrote of her: ""The idea of his marrying her is insane.
""To kiss her feet is the utmost man should think of doing.""
But after Siddell's death, Rossetti and Jane Morris began an affair that spanned most of her life.
At the top of a Rossetti painting of Morris, he wrote in Latin: ""Famous for her poet husband, and famous for her face, may my picture add to her fame.""
The two pictures now at auction recall her fame again.
In the 1861 drawing, Rossetti depicts Morris as Lachesis, one of the three mythological fates, spinning the thread of life.
The auction house said it could be seen ""as a hidden allusion to her power to determine his destiny on both personal and artistic levels"".
By the time of the painting from 1872, never before sold, Rossetti's depiction of his lover as Proserpine was far more sexualised.
""You see the distinctive voluptuous lips.
""It's not a finished study - you can see the blue underdrawing, showing his technique"", Ms Drummond said.
The woman in the pictures represented a triumph of re-invention.
She was born Jane Burden in St Helen's Passage off Holywell Street in Oxford, now marked with a blue plaque.
She was the daughter of a stableman who worked at Symond's Livery Stable.

"""Even if I am withdrawing into prayer, I will always be close to all of you... even if I remain hidden to the world,"" he told a meeting of Roman priests.
The pontiff, 85, shocked the world's biggest Christian Church on Monday when he announced his resignation.
He cited his advanced age as the reason for resigning.
According to the Vatican's semi-official newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, the Pope took the decision to resign after his trip to Mexico and Cuba in 2012.
The Vatican confirmed on Thursday that Pope Benedict had hit his head during the March trip to Mexico, but denied the accident had any role in his decision.
According to a report in Italy's La Stampa newspaper, the Pope was lightly injured after getting up in the middle of the night in an unfamiliar bedroom during the trip, with blood staining his hair and sheets.
Earlier this week, the Vatican said for the first time that Pope Benedict had a pacemaker, and that he had undergone surgery to replace the batteries three months ago.
The Pope appears to be planning a complete retreat from the public eye, the BBC's Alan Johnston reports from the Vatican.
However, he is expected to spend his retirement in a monastery at the Vatican and his relationship with his successor as pope is bound to be an endless source of speculation, our correspondent adds.
A new pope is expected to be elected by cardinals before Easter, which falls on 31 March this year.
Pope Benedict made his remarks at the Vatican in what amounted to a farewell address to hundreds of priests who serve in the Diocese of Rome, our correspondent says.
He appealed to the spirit of the reformist Second Vatican Council of the 1960s.
How many Catholics are there in the world?
How does a Pope resign from office?
""We must work for the realisation of the real council and for a real renewal of the Church,"" he said.
Speaking earlier, some of the unnamed priests gave their reaction to the pontiff's decision to resign.
""People are divided, some say that he was right in doing so, since he did not feel able to continue any longer, others on the contrary feel dejected,"" said one.
""As for me, I am grieved and I hope and I pray for Benedict XVI, hoping that the Church again finds strength.""
""It was certainly a surprise for everybody,"" said another.
""Maybe in this moment we cannot easily understand it since all of us are feeling shocked but it is a sign that our pontiff wanted to act for the good of the Church.
""He steps aside not because he abandons Peter's boat, but because he wants this boat to be led with the help of the Holy Spirit through a person who is strong.""
Next week the Pope will carry out no public engagements after which he will hold one more public audience on 27 February, in St Peter's Square.
On 28 February he will fly off to the papal retreat at Castel Gandolfo, where he will stay while Church leaders go through the complicated ritual of choosing a successor.","The outgoing head of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Benedict XVI, has hinted he will withdraw into seclusion after stepping down at the end of this month.",21458783

"Zhou's son Zhou Bin was imprisoned for 18 years while his his wife Jia Xiaoyue will serve nine years.
Zhou Yongkang was once one of the most powerful officials in China, running the internal security forces.
He was jailed for life after his corruption conviction last year, partly as a result of his family's testimony.
Zhou is the most senior official to fall as part of President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign, which was launched in 2012.
A court in the central city of Yichang found Zhou Bin guilty of taking 222 million yuan ($34m; Â£24m) in bribes and running an illegal business trading in restricted commodities, the CCTV state broadcaster reported.
The court confiscated what it said were his illicit gains and fined him a total of 350 million yuan ($53m; Â£37m), CCTV said.
The same court also imprisoned Zhou Yongkang's wife Jia Xiaoye - a former TV journalist - for taking bribes. She was fined 1m yuan ($150,000; Â£105,000)
Zhou Bin initially escaped arrest by going to the US in early 2013, sources told the Reuters news agency. But he returned to China after negotiations with Chinese authorities. It is not clear whether he had legal representation.
Zhou Bin used his father's influence ""in collaboration with others""  to accept valuable property, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
Zhou Yongkang was a member of China's elite Politburo Standing Committee and was responsible for the police, the judiciary and domestic surveillance.
But he became one of the most senior leaders to be imprisoned by the Communist Party took since the early 1980s, when the Gang of Four were put on trial for instigating the chaos of the Cultural Revolution.
Scores of Zhou's associates have also been arrested, mostly in the southern province of Sichuan where he was head of the Communist Party from 1999 to 2002.

"Students have also protested in the capital, Nairobi, ahead of a candle-lit vigil demanding more protection from the al-Qaeda-linked Somali militants.
The assault on Garissa University on Thursday killed 148 people.
Five Kenyans have appeared in court for suspected links with the attackers.
The court in Nairobi agreed to the prosecution's request to detain them for another 30 days, while police investigate whether they supplied weapons to the attackers, Kenya's Capital FM reports.
A sixth suspect, a Tanzanian, is being held in the north-eastern town of Garissa, which is about 150km (90 miles) from the border with Somalia.
Last Thursday's attack was the deadliest in Kenya by al-Shabab, which was formed in neighbouring Somalia about eight years ago.
The militants have promised a ""long, gruesome war"" against Kenya after Kenya sent troops to Somalia in 2011 to fight them.
The BBC's Bashkash Jugsooda'ay in Garissa says both Muslims and Christians took part in the march and promised to co-operate with the security forces to flush out militants who may be hiding in their community.
However, protesters were also critical of the security forces, saying they were slow in their response to the assault, he says.
They pointed out that both the army and police had bases in Garissa. Yet, four gunmen managed to storm the campus, taking students hostage in dormitories and killing them in a day-long attack.
Analysis: Anne Soy, BBC Africa, Nairobi
There is a hashtag trending on Twitter - #147notjustanumber in memory of the people killed in the Garissa attacks last week.
Kenyans are angry. They feel the government has not done enough to ensure security, especially as there had been material circulating on social media warning about attacks.
Unfortunately it looks like this is leading to profiling of Kenyans of Somali ethnicity - and there are many of them.

Thirteen people were shot dead on 30 January 1972 when British paratroopers opened fire at a civil rights march.
Hillsborough campaigner Margaret Aspinall said the families ""must carry on"" the pursuit for truth and justice.
The Bloody Sunday inquiry, led by Lord Saville, took 12 years to complete and exonerated those who died.
Following the findings of the report Prime Minister David Cameron said he was ""deeply sorry"".
In April, a jury found that the 96 football fans who died in the 1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster were unlawfully killed.
Margaret Aspinall's 18-year-old son James died at the FA Cup semi-final.
She said families of victims of the Troubles should never give up the pursuit of justice.

""Stay strong and keep the hope going like the families of Hillsborough had to, that's what kept us going, the hope that one day we would get it.
""With other people, the Bloody Sunday families, we are united in truth and justice. It is very, very important to stick together and show your support to each other.""
Margaret Aspinall, Sue Roberts and Jenni Hicks have campaigned for 27 years to uncover the truth of the 1989 stadium disaster.

"In the first quarter of 2015, it said that 0.89% of applications for current accounts came from criminals.
The figures mean that bank accounts have overtaken mortgages as the biggest source of attempted fraud.
In comparison, 0.83% of mortgage applications were fraudulent over the same period.
The main reason for the rise was ""an exponential increase"" in identity fraud, when criminals use somebody else's personal details to set up an account.
Of those trying to open accounts fraudulently, 49% used a stolen identity. That was up from 32% in the first three months of 2014, said Experian.
The firm is employed by many High Street banks to detect criminal activity.
Criminals opening current accounts are then able to access other financial products, such as credit cards, which are also used to steal money.
Many will have obtained personal details through phishing emails, which trick account holders into revealing numbers and passwords.
""Knowing what your bank can and cannot ask you for will help you avoid phishing scams,"" said Nick Mothershaw, a director of identity and fraud at Experian.
""Making sure sensitive mail is shredded is also important.""
Customers who are the innocent victims of fraud are usually reimbursed by their bank. Nevertheless account holders are being warned to be vigilant.

"Countries in the oil cartel Opec and several other oil nations started to reduce production at the start of 2017.
The move initially pushed up the oil price, but it has dropped in the last few weeks on fears the limits would not be enough to deal with an oil glut.
A group of ministers agreed on Sunday to review extending the cuts by six months, taking them to the end of 2017.
At a meeting in Kuwait, they requested that officials report next month ""regarding the extension of the voluntary production adjustments"".
Opec countries and 11 other oil-producing nations, including Russia, agreed in December 2016 to slash production, the first time in 15 years that a global pact had been struck.
The price of Brent crude peaked at over $57 a barrel in January, before slipping back to below $51 a barrel in recent weeks.
That was after Opec revealed a surprise jump in global crude stocks in February, and US oil producers - who are not part of the cuts - started to increase production again.
Abhishek Deshpande, an oil analyst at Natixis, told the BBC the price had fallen after oil traders became ""jittery"" about the market.
In particular, they were uncertain about the commitment of Russia and Saudi Arabia, Opec's biggest member, to the cuts, Mr Deshpande said.
The oil countries now need to show ""discipline"" and cut back on production in the coming months because stocks are still too high, he said.

"Townsend, 68, died at home on Thursday after a short illness.
The first of her comic series, The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, aged 13 3/4, was published in 1982 and the eighth instalment, Adrian Mole: The Prostrate Years, was released in 2009.
Her other best-selling novels included The Queen and I.
Townsend, who was left blind after suffering from diabetes for many years, achieved worldwide success following the publication of the books about teenager Adrian Mole.
The series followed the main character from adolescence under Margaret Thatcher's government, to maturity in Tony Blair's Britain.
Townsend said that, in many respects, her hero mirrored her own experience.
In March 2013, she told the Oxford Literary Festival that publication of the next Adrian Mole book had been pushed back as a result of a stroke she had suffered.
She was diagnosed with diabetes in the 1980s and underwent a kidney transplant in 2009. She had the stroke in December 2012.
Comedian and writer Danny Wallace is one of a number of those who have paid tribute to Townsend.
Wallace told the BBC: ""If ever I saw that she was in a town close to me - and I'd never been to book readings or book signings before - but I always made sure I went to hers.
""She was incredibly sweet to her younger fans and I've got all these books at home that she had signed and she would say, 'To Daniel, from Sue Townsend aged 43 and three quarters' or '45 and a half'.
""So she really understood what people loved about Adrian Mole I think.""
Actor Stephen Mangan, who played Adrian Mole in a 2001 television adaptation, told Radio 4's Today programme that Townsend took him ""under her wing"" during filming.
""There was something really special about Sue. She was a hero of mine when I read the books as an adolescent - I was pretty much the same age as Adrian - but when I met her I just fell in love with her really,"" he said.
""She was warm, she was funny, she was self-deprecating. She was incredibly encouraging.
""It was the first time I'd ever played a lead part in a series and, however confident I must have tried to appear, she instinctively knew how difficult it was for me to come and lead a company with people like Alison Steadman and Zoe Wanamaker and Helen Baxendale. I'll miss her a lot.""
Harry Potter author JK Rowling paid tribute on Twitter, writing ""So sad to hear about Sue Townsend. She gave me so many laughs.""
She added: ""#AdrianMoleWillLiveForever.""

Crime writer Ian Rankin described her death as ""a real loss"".
Writer Caitlin Moran tweeted that Townsend was ""one of the funniest women who ever lived.""
Townsend was born in Leicester in 1946, and set her most famous work in her home city.
The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, aged 13 3/4, was followed by The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole in 1984.
The two books made her the best-selling novelist of the 1980s and they were followed by others in the Mole series, including The True Confessions of Adrian Albert Mole.
Several of her books were adapted for the stage, while the Mole series was adapted for radio, television and theatre.
Townsend was awarded an honorary Masters of Arts from Leicester University and in 2008 was made a Distinguished Honorary Fellow of the university.
She was also an Honorary Doctor of Letters at Loughborough University and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.
In 2009 Townsend was given the Honorary Freedom of Leicester.

"The Ofsted boss said while standards were rising overall, the number of poorly performing schools in the north and the East Midlands would continue to fuel the sense of a divided nation.
He said the situation was very serious.
The government said 89% of schools were good or outstanding.
In an interview with the BBC in Manchester, Sir Michael said the economic future of the north of England relied on addressing the poor performance of some schools.
He said the European Union referendum result had revealed a wider malaise, with communities feeling their needs were being ignored.
Although some northern city centre areas voted strongly to stay in the EU, large parts of Greater Manchester and some Merseyside towns voted in great numbers to leave.
""The situation is very, very serious. If you look at Manchester, the city we're in, nearly one in three schools [is] not good. In Liverpool, half are good. If you look at satellite towns, things are worse.
""It's feeding into a sense that the people of Liverpool, Manchester and the North are not being treated fairly - that their children have less of a chance of educational success than people south of the Wash.
""And that's feeding into a wider malaise that I sense with the Brexit vote, that actually this wasn't just about leaving Europe, it's about 'our needs being neglected, our children are not getting as good a deal as elsewhere'.
""Parents want to see their children doing well; they want to see them going off to university; they want to see them getting a good job.
""Well, they have less of a chance of that in this city, in Liverpool and elsewhere and that feeds into this sense of discontent in the North and in the Midlands.""
His report said there was considerable evidence that schools in isolated and deprived areas where educational standards are low are losing out in the recruitment stakes.
It added that heads in north-west England are reporting an ""auction"" for teachers - particularly in Greater Manchester for hard to recruit subjects.
But there are also shortfalls in secondary subjects in south-east England.
Sir Michael said addressing education must be a government priority.
The Ofsted annual report, published on Thursday morning, highlights that overall standards are rising, with 1.8m more pupils in good or outstanding maintained schools in 2016 than in 2010.
During this period, the curriculum and assessment regime had become more rigorous and children from poor backgrounds were gaining ground on their peers in national primary tests.
But the report also said to become truly world class, England needed to have:
It also highlighted the poor quality of education in the more geographically and economically isolated parts of the country, including coastal areas.
School Standards Minister Nick Gibb said good and outstanding schools now made up 89% of all schools inspected in England but  acknowledged there was more to do.
""That's precisely why we have set out plans to make more good school places available, to more parents, in more parts of the country - including scrapping the ban on new grammar school places, and harnessing the resources and expertise of universities, independent and faith schools,"" he added.
Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the reasons for educational underperformance in some areas were complex.
He said: ""Industrial decline, generational unemployment and high levels of deprivation have had a devastating impact on many parts of the country, creating extremely challenging social conditions.
""Schools in these areas often find it difficult to recruit staff and are hit particularly badly by the on-going nationwide teacher recruitment crisis.""
Sir Michael retires as head of Ofsted at the end of the year. He will be succeeded by Amanda Spielman, who currently chairs exams regulator Ofqual.

"Speaking during a week-long visit to the United States, he said those issues are his ""immediate priorities"".
Mr Kenny will return to Dublin on Saturday, having met US President Donald Trump on his trip to America.
Critics within his Fine Gael party have been pressing for him to give a timetable for his departure as leader.
Last month, the Irish coalition government, made up of Fine Gael and the Independent Alliance, survived a vote of no confidence in parliament.
Before leaving Ireland for his annual engagements in the US to mark St Patrick's Day, Mr Kenny told his party that he would address his future ""effectively and conclusively"" when he returned.
But during the St Patrick's Day parade in New York on Friday, he said that political talks in Northern Ireland and forming a standpoint on Brexit would ""take precedence over everything else"".
""I have a number of immediate priorities on my desk when I arrive back tomorrow morning,"" he told Irish journalists.
""You can't have a situation where you have no leadership in Northern Ireland.
""Do you not think it is appropriate that the immediate priority is to have an executive functioning in Northern Ireland?""
Talks between Northern Ireland's political parties and the UK and Irish governments are continuing with a view to restoring a power-sharing executive at Stormont after this month's assembly election.
Mr Kenny also said that it was important for him to ""get an agreed negotiating stance"" with other European Union member states ahead of talks with the UK over its withdrawal from the union.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will begin the Brexit process by the end of this month, a move that looks set to have major implications for the neighbouring Republic of Ireland.
""It's going to affect everybody in our country - these are two immediate priorities,"" Mr Kenny said.

"Ms Chacón was found dead at her Madrid home, aged 46, after a neighbour had raised the alarm. A congenital heart problem was the likely cause of death.
She was Spain's first woman defence minister, symbolising the change of culture since the end of military rule.
Her son Miquel is eight years old.
In 2007 Ms Chacón also served as housing minister in the Socialist government led by ex-Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero.
Spanish politicians were among the many Spaniards who expressed shock and sympathy over Ms Chacón's sudden death.
Mr Zapatero said he was ""heartbroken at the death of my comrade and friend"".
He said ""we feel emptiness, because of the enormity of this loss, for Spanish democracy and for all socialists"".
The current Popular Party (PP) defence minister, Dolores de Cospedal, said ""I deeply mourn the ex-minister"". ""My heartfelt condolences to her family, friends and the Socialist Party. RIP.""
At the age of 37, and seven months pregnant, she visited Afghanistan, five days after being appointed defence minister.
She told Spain's El Pais daily ""pregnant or not, I was clear that my first duty was to visit those who are able to put their lives at risk for higher values: for other people's freedom"".
""A pregnant woman is not sick. Sure, it's harder when you're pregnant and on your feet all day. I wanted to express society's gratitude to those who put themselves in danger to bring peace to regions of conflict.""
Spaniard Victor Orive-Martin tweeted the famous photo, in a tribute to Ms Chacón, calling her ""a wonderful human being"".
After the Afghanistan trip she also reviewed troops in Madrid while pregnant in May 2008.
She joined the Socialist Youth at the age of 18, and began her political career as a local councillor in 1999-2007. Later she served as an MP representing a Barcelona constituency. She was born in Llobregat, Barcelona, in 1971.
She was the daughter of a fire service official in Barcelona and his lawyer wife. As a girl she had been advised to lead a calm life because of her heart condition. But she ignored the advice repeatedly - including the suggestion that it would be risky to have children, El Pais reports.
Ms Chacón had also taught political science at Miami Dade College, in Florida, whose president Eduardo J Padrón said her contribution had ""left an indelible mark"".

And Spanish women are losing someone who always took a stand to emphasise the importance of women's roles in modern society, and among the college's faculty and students.""","Spain is mourning Carme Chacón, the former defence minister who died on Sunday and was famously photographed in 2008 reviewing troops in Afghanistan while seven months pregnant.",39551922

"Two separate Air Transat flights were diverted to Ottawa airport on Monday due to bad weather, leaving passengers on one of the planes stuck for more than five hours.

Another passenger tweeted videos from inside the aircraft, which at one point lost power and air conditioning prompting reports that a child fell ill from the heat in the cabin.
When a third passenger called the 911 emergency services number, the Montreal based Air Transat crew were filmed asking the caller to come forward, leading to angry responses on social media.
One Twitter user posted: ""Heard your pilot sounding annoyed that someone had RIGHTFULLY CALLED 911..!!! Seriously, what's wrong with you people?""
In the other diverted flight from Rome to Montreal passengers could not get out of the plane for four hours.
News media in Canada reported at least one passenger on that flight also requested help from the emergency services.
Ottawa International airport which became congested following a number of diverted flights tweeted it is the airline's decision on whether or not passengers can disembark.
It also confirmed that the emergency services had received several 911 calls from passengers on flights at the airport.
Krista Kealey, spokesperson for Ottawa International Airport Authority said: ""We had a gate available and air stairs ready in the event that the airline decided to deplane. We also had buses on the tarmac ready to shuttle passengers to the terminal - buses the Authority purchased specifically for situations such as this.
""Neither the ground handling service nor the airline requested either of these during the event.
""We keep a supply of water, food, diapers and other personal hygiene necessities to support passenger needs in irregular operation scenarios, and were prepared to deploy these supplies.
""Although our staff tried several times to contact the aircrew through the handlers to provide further assistance, the air crew was non-communicative and did not take us up on our offers to assist further.

"This includes a pay increase for staff, putting into law the mandatory minimum number of staff per patient and funding training for health professionals.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Labour's shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said the money for these pledges would be raised by increasing corporation tax.
How much will need to be raised has not yet been confirmed.
Corporation tax - the tax on companies' profits - has been cut from 28% in 2010 to 19%, and is due to come down to 17% by 2020.
Labour used official figures to calculate that between 2016-17 and 2021-22, cuts to corporation tax would amount to £64bn less in the public purse.
We are talking about the NHS in England only since health is a devolved matter and the other nations' administrations generally set their own policies.
For example, although the recommendations of pay review bodies are UK-wide, nations get to choose whether to accept them.
It is unlikely that the precise figures behind Labour's policies will be available until the party's manifesto is published, next month.
Even then, we probably will not know exactly by how much pay will be increased and what level the minimum staffing will be set at, so it's difficult to say exactly how much this all going to cost.
However, we can estimate how much various elements of the pledge might cost.
Labour said it would  increase pay to a ""sustainable level"" and lift the pay cap currently in force that means NHS staff pay has not increased by more than 1% a year for the past six years, although many staff also get incremental pay-rises to reflect progression within their roles.
We don't know exactly what a ""sustainable increase"" will be.
Mr Ashworth said the decision would be taken by an independent pay review body.
Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, has estimated that every 1% pay rise would cost £500m a year.
Labour's own estimates put it at £350m, but this excludes doctors.
When the government cut funding for health students by replacing grants with loans, it calculated this would save the Treasury £800m, so we can reasonably say reversing this cut would cost the same amount.
Labour also set out plans to introduce mandatory minimum staffing levels.
Sir Robert Francis' report into the failings at the Mid-Staffordshire Foundation Trust published in February 2013 found low levels of staffing were linked to poor care and recommended minimum safe staffing levels should be drawn up.
The Public Accounts Committee, a cross-party group of MPs responsible for overseeing government expenditure, estimated last year that the NHS was short-staffed by about 50,000. Employing this number of extra people could cost about £2-3bn depending on how many of them were nurses, doctors or in other roles.
The NHS spends about £40bn a year on front-line staff.
Another 50,000 staff would be about a 6% increase to the total number of NHS staff caring for patients, amounting to an extra £2.4bn on the pay bill.
This is a very rough estimate.
Mr Ashworth also pointed out that hiring more staff and raising their pay would help reduce the NHS's dependency on agency workers who cost the health service more than salaried employees.
In 2015, agency nurses cost, on average, an estimated £39 per hour, compared with £27 per hour for NHS staff bank nurses.
However, this is not the only way Labour has promised to spend the extra money from raising corporation tax.
Since Jeremy Corbyn became leader of the party, in 2015, Labour has pledged to raise corporation tax to fund:

During Wenger's time at the club, Arsenal moved to the new Emirates Stadium close to their old ground at Highbury.
Wenger, who became the longest-serving manager in England when Sir Alex Ferguson retired from Manchester United in May 2013, is credited with bringing new ideas about sports science and nutrition to English football.
""This is a guy who works 24 hours a day all year around,"" former Arsenal goalkeeper Bob Wilson told BBC Radio 5 live.
""He hates to lose. He totally revolutionised all sorts of things in the game in this country. People tend to think he has too much power, (but) a guy who dedicates himself to the game in the manner that he does is someone you treasure.""
Wenger has not enjoyed the easiest of seasons, and a 6-0 thrashing by Chelsea in March during his 1,000th game in charge led to suggestions this season could be his last at the club.
Arsenal chairman Sir Chips Keswick said: ""Arsene is a man of principle, who lives and breathes Arsenal.
""He has established Arsenal for its exciting playing style around the world, continues his commitment to young players and has the ability to bring top-class players to the club.""
With the FA Cup back in Arsenal's trophy room once more and the winning feeling back at the club, along with Champions League football again, Wenger's commitment to the future became a formality.

Wenger has won three league titles, five FA Cups and four Charity/Community Shields during his time at Arsenal.
His greatest achievement was when his 'Invincibles' remained unbeaten in winning the 2003-04 Premier League.
Arsenal have not won the title since, and, despite being in contention for much of this season following the club record signing of Mesut Ozil for £42.4m, they faded to finish fourth for the sixth time in nine years.
Stan Kronke, Arsenal's major shareholder, said: ""Sustained excellence is the hardest thing to achieve in sport.
""The fact Arsenal has competed at the top of the game in England and Europe throughout the time Arsene has been manager is the ultimate testimony to his consistency of performance, talent and ambition.
""We are delighted with the FA Cup success which has added to his already outstanding record. Under his guidance, we look forward to adding more trophies.""",Arsene Wenger has signed a three-year deal to remain Arsenal manager.,27635264
"Patrick Flinders, from Jersey, suffered a fractured skull and was flown to the UK on Sunday with fellow survivor Scott Bennell-Smith, 16, from Cornwall.
Patrick's father said he was a ""hero"" for trying to fight off the bear that killed Horatio Chapple, 17, on Friday.
Two expedition leaders with ""severe"" injuries will be flown home later.
Michael ""Spike"" Reid, 29, from Plymouth and Andrew Ruck, 27, who is from Brighton but lives in Edinburgh, are said to be in a ""stable"" condition.
The British Schools Exploring Society, a youth development charity which organised the expedition, said in a statement they would be admitted to hospital on arrival.
Mr Reid shot the bear dead, but was also mauled himself.
All four survivors injured in the attack on Spitsbergen island, Norway, had been receiving treatment at a hospital in Tromso.
Patrick's father Terry Flinders said his son was being treated at Southampton General Hospital, while he believed that Scott, from St Mellion, was taken to a hospital in Plymouth.
Mr Flinders said doctors in Southampton had told him that his son suffered a fractured skull and that some of the polar bear's teeth had to be removed from his head during surgery in Norway.
His parents had previously thought he had only been bitten on the arm and swiped in the face by the bear.
Patrick is said to be conscious and lucid and under observation by the medical team at the hospital.
Mr Flinders had earlier said his son had attempted to defend the group, saying he ""tried to jump on it and smash the polar bear's nose"" when the animal attacked the boys in their tent.
Scott shot but did not kill the bear, which then ""went for Patrick, he bit his arm and then just swiped his face and top of his head. And then the same with Scottie,"" Mr Flinders said.
Referring to a conversation he had with his son, he said:  ""I told him 'you're a hero here mate, the way you attacked that bear'.
""He said he can't remember doing it, but I suppose it might come back to him later.""
Doctors are set to assess Patrick on Monday in a bid to ascertain when he can be transferred home to Jersey.
Scott's father, Peter, said in a statement that Friday was the worst day of his life.
""It will never leave me to think how close Scott came to being killed that day,"" he said.
""I am so sorry for the loss of his new friend and fellow adventurer, Horatio. It is every parent's worst nightmare.""
The family of Horatio paid tribute to him in a statement, describing him as ""strong, fearless and kind"".
They said Mr Chapple had been ""so excited about his plans to be a doctor"" and praised his ""amazing sense of humour and ability to laugh at himself"".
Eton College, where Mr Chapple was a pupil, expressed its deep sadness at the schoolboy's death and offered its condolences to his family and friends.
The attack on the campsite near the Von Post glacier about 25 miles (40km) from Longyearbyen, took place early on Friday.
The BSES, based in west London, organises scientific expeditions to remote areas to develop teamwork and a spirit of adventure. There were 80 people on the trip to Spitsbergen, which had been scheduled to run until 28 August.
Its statement said the eight uninjured members of the group involved in the incident had returned to the UK and were with their families.
The other groups would return on Tuesday, it added.","A 16-year-old boy injured by a polar bear in Norway had some of the animal's teeth removed from his skull during emergency surgery, it has emerged.",14439244

"The Castlebawn development was to include a 20,000 sq metre shopping centre, business park, hotel and care home.

The firm's director Fearghal Eastwood said the administration was a consensual arrangement and that he was continuing to work with Cerberus in an advisory capacity.

"In a T-shirt emblazoned ""REAL MEN WEAR TIGHTS"", Andrew McNicol directs his young cast with the authority and self-assurance of a seasoned professional.
""That was about 40%,"" the 18-year-old tells his cast after an energetic run-through of a party scene.  It was clearly not quite energetic enough. They hit 60% on the next attempt.
It is a humid afternoon at Tring Park School for the Performing Arts in Hertfordshire, and rehearsals are well under way for Ballet Chocolat - the highlight of the National Youth Ballet's 2011 season.
Following a world premiere in Tonbridge, Kent, a gala performance of Ballet Chocolat and several other works takes place at Sadler's Wells on 11 September.
The season includes the premiere of Feeling Groovy, choreographed by Antony Dowson, which marries classical ballet with the songs of Simon and Garfunkel; and Jo Meredith's Cowardly Affair with music by Noel Coward.
McNicol came up with the idea of putting on a ballet version of Joanne Harris's 1999 novel after he was principal dancer in last year's NYB season.
He pitched it to NYB's founder Jill Tookey, who quickly secured permission to use Rachel Portman's Oscar-nominated score from the 2000 film version.
'Love and courage'
""I've always like the challenge of the impossible,"" laughs the 74-year-old Tookey, who established the National Youth Ballet in 1988 and has run it on an unpaid basis ever since.
""The skill was to reduce a feature film to a 35-minute ballet and keep the atmosphere.""
What made Chocolat ideal ballet material? ""It's a tale of acceptance of one's self and others,"" McNicol explains.
""It's a tale of love and courage and that's such a great universal message. You can read it on many levels and it's appropriate for a huge audience range.""
Winner of the Kenneth MacMillan Choreographic Award in 2008, McNicol is enjoying the challenge of working on a longer project.
""I've been wanting to do a much larger work,"" he says. ""All my choreography is quite narrative based.
""It's a real challenge to get anything across when you only have five or 10 minutes. I've always wanted more time - and this seemed like the opportunity to say more.""
McNicol, who turns 19 next month, is about to enter his final year at Central School of Ballet.
He made his professional stage debut aged eight in 2000 in the Northern Ballet Theatre's A Christmas Carol.
""It was just a small children's part, but I must have caught the bug then,"" he says. ""I made the conscious decision to follow a career in ballet when I was about 12.
""I was at a normal school at the time, and I really hated it. I didn't belong there. I wasn't interested in what they were doing.
""I went on tour with Ballet West Scotland, and I lived the dream, but I had to come back to school.""
McNicol auditioned and got into the Royal Ballet School's White Lodge in 2007.
""I was transported to another entirely different world that I didn't know existed. No one in my family has ballet background.
""Sometimes I go home and say what I've been doing and my mum says she doesn't understand what I'm talking about!
""It's good to have that grounding and real normality because sometimes you can get a bit lost in things.""
So how does Jill Tookey see McNicol's career developing? ""I ultimately see him as a director of his own company or one of the major companies,"" she says.
""He has this terrific focus that embraces all the arts. It's really important for a ballet company or a youth company like us to see that wider picture.""
McNicol agrees. ""I've wanted my own company for quite a while - that's my ultimate goal.
""But I do want to dance first and gain more skills which will help with choreography and directing.""
Even when he unwinds outside the world of ballet, McNicol is never far from the arts. ""I love literature,"" he reveals. ""Poetry is my real escape.
""I used to paint, and I've really missed that with being so busy. And I love going to Paris - but I always end up going to the Paris opera!""
National Youth Ballet will perform at the EM Forster Theatre in Tonbridge, Kent from 25 to 27 August. A gala night will be held at Sadler's Wells, London, on 11 September.","A rapidly rising star in the world of ballet, teenager Andrew McNicol, is taking on his biggest challenge yet - choreographing the National Youth Ballet's production of Chocolat.",14504774
"Ofsted downgraded Darul Hadis Latifiah in Bethnal Green, saying pupils were not being ""prepared for life in modern Britain"".
Inspectors found ""grimy"" facilities and ""inappropriate"" literature.
The school, for boys aged 11 to 20, said it was ""preparing a formal complaint"" in response. It said the camera only viewed the ""washing area"".
Ofsted reported a CCTV camera was found ""in the communal area of the toilets"" and displayed images in ""plain view"" of the reception area.
Changing rooms and showers were labelled ""grimy and disgusting"" after mouse droppings and sharp metal were found on the floor.
During a two-and-a-half day inspection in October a book was found in the school library which ""promoted inappropriate views of how girls and women should behave"".
School leaders said they were ""unaware"" of the book's presence, but claimed the book referred to the belief women should ""dress modestly"".
Ofsted concluded ""there are too few opportunities to learn about women in modern society"" at the school.
Very few pupils were able to name ""the new British prime minister or were aware of the first female presidential candidate in the elections taking place in the United States of America"" during the inspection.
Respect for women was taught, but was limited ""to the roles of motherhood and families"" during Islamic studies, the report added.
Some pupils told the inspector that if they asked questions about sex and relationships they would get a detention.
Inspectors concluded the government's flagship counter-terrorism strategy was not being implemented at the school.
Failing to identify any risks to pupils in line with the government's ""Prevent strategy"" left pupils ""exposed to being drawn into situations which put them at risk of harm"", Ofsted concluded.

"She was referring to the massive US aid programme for Europe launched after World War Two.
Her comments came after Sierra Leone was immediately granted more than $80m (Â£52m) to help end the Ebola outbreak and recover from its effects.
The IMF has pledged a $187m financial aid package for Sierra Leone.
Nearly $5bn has been pledged internationally to the Ebola effort, but less than half of the help has materialised.
About 600 delegates from around the world met in Brussels on Tuesday to talk about Ebola and long-term plans to fight the disease.
Nearly 10,000 people have died in the outbreak, the vast majority in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
This meeting is not a donor pledging conference - it marks the beginning of a new conversation, whose objectives could be difficult to achieve.
It comes at a time when new cases of infection are significantly down.
Compared to HIV 30 years ago, this Ebola epidemic was met by a better organised international community. But even so, the pledges for support and actual disbursement of aid were slow to come. With the epidemic seemingly under control, the next phase - recovery - is going to be longer and more challenging.
The call is for a process led and owned by the affected countries. But real recovery will only be achieved if there is complementary long-term commitment from donor countries - a clear intervention with definitive objectives and timelines.
And the bar for transparency and accountability will no doubt be raised.
Speaking in Brussels, Ms Sirleaf said: ""We believe that a regional approach would achieve the best recovery results. This can only be achieved with your support, the support of partners who will be willing to allocate resources to a regional plan that is home-grown.""
""There is no doubt that this will require significant resources, perhaps even a Marshall Plan... We believe however that this can be achieved through allocation of the additional resources committed by the European Commission"", she said.
""Resources can also be sourced from the CCR [Catastrophe Containment and Relief] Trust Fund established by the International Monetary Fund and by regional envelopes by the World Bank and the African Development Bank.""
On Monday the UN said that the struggle to contain the epidemic was reaching a ""second phase"".
UN experts say the spread of the disease in West Africa has dropped to almost 10% of what it was six months ago.
Liberia in particular continues to have a low level of transmission, with only one new confirmed case in the week leading to 22 February. This compares to 34 in Guinea and 63 in Sierra Leone.
But the UN special envoy on Ebola, David Nabarro, told AP that the international community should not become complacent as getting to zero cases was ""the hardest part"".
""It's a really difficult, painstaking task,"" he said.
The BBC's Anne Soy, in Brussels, says that there is a danger of donor fatigue, even though the Ebola outbreak has received a lot of attention from the international community.
The healthcare systems of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone will also need help to recover from the effects of the outbreak.
Scarce healthcare resources have had to be directed to controlling the epidemic and it has become harder to get treatment for other diseases.

"In part one, a County Antrim surgeon decides to go public after 15 years of keeping her abortion a secret.
Doctor Eunice Minford said women who choose to have an abortion should not have to be diagnosed as being mentally ill in order for a termination to take place.
She said she was breaking her silence as she could no longer tolerate women who have had terminations being made to feel that they are hiding ""some kind of dirty little secret"".
Dr Minford had an abortion in 2001.
She said she hoped that by speaking up it would inspire others to do the same and ""claim what is true for them"".
""To show we don't have to hang our heads in shame; we can walk tall and know that we make a true choice that was right for us at the time we had the abortion,"" she added.
Dr Minford became pregnant when she was studying for her final surgical exams in England in 2001.
Aged 35, she said discovering she was pregnant was her worst nightmare come true.
""I was hard on myself,"" she said. ""I beat myself up.
""I judged myself even more so because I am a doctor and doctors are supposed to know better - we aren't supposed to make mistakes.
""There was very little compassion for myself at the time.
""This became, as it did for many others, their dirty little secret that they can't feel they can tell people about.
""I told my partner at the time and one other person and it was like that for years.""
Unlike the rest of the UK, abortion is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or there is a permanent or serious risk to her mental or physical health.
Dr Minford said it was wrong and unacceptable that women who find themselves unexpectedly pregnant have to be examined by a psychiatrist with a risk of being diagnosed with a mental health problem before they can access abortion services.
""We do not have to be deemed mentally ill in order to make that decision,"" she said.
""Again this is part of the patriarchal supremacy and the domination of a woman that we have tended to submit to.""
She said women had to stand up and say ""no, this is not acceptable - we know our own bodies, our own minds"".
""We are the world expert on our own life and we are capable of making that choice without needing those assessments and being deemed mentally unwell.""
I asked how she was able to marry her conviction that women should be allowed to choose to abort a foetus, with her role as a doctor who often saves lives.
""Yes, I work in the health service helping people, but what motivates me is my love of God, of helping people and the truth,"" she said.
Dr Minford is planning to publish a blog about her abortion experience, and she hopes it will both help and inform others.
During the interview, she recalled the fear instilled in young women in Northern Ireland about becoming pregnant while unmarried.
""I don't believe any young girl or woman grows up thinking: 'Oh, when I grow up I'm going to have an abortion', or that she wants to have an abortion,"" she said.
""It is not something we desire or aspire to or plan.
""I did not consider myself that sort of person who has an unplanned pregnancy.""
Northern Ireland's abortion debate has stepped up a gear.
The recent suspended sentence given to a young woman who bought abortion pills online has thrown the issue back onto the news agenda.
Dr Minford described herself as being like a closed book.
But she said she was so passionate about informing the debate that she was prepared to risk her reputation.
""There is very much pro-life and pro-choice,"" she said.
""It becomes them and us and who is right and who is wrong.
""But at the end of the day there is no them and us - there is only us and I feel we need to develop more understanding and compassion for women and where they are at.
""We are only human.""

He becomes Accies' second signing of this week after the arrival of full-back Jack Breslin, released by Celtic.

Matthews has already had two loan spells with Burton Albion and ended last season playing nine times for Doncaster Rovers in England's League One.

"In truth it has all happened so quickly - little more than a year from the germ of an idea to Elysian omnipotence - that the country feels slightly dazed.
People are looking at their new leader, and many more than voted for him are honestly impressed by his calibre. But many are also wondering: so where do we go from here?
For there is an unknown aspect to the coming mandate that sets it apart from all that went before.
It is not just the newness of it all:  the fact that President Macron's party didn't exist until he dreamed it up, and that half of the new parliamentarians will need lessons (literally) in how to do their jobs.
And that never before - at least not since Charles de Gaulle in 1958 - has a head of state had such a powerful majority, made up of men and women who depend on him so personally for their new careers.
And that the opposition has been reduced to a rump, thanks to the dÃ©gagiste (kick 'em out) imperative that wipes out sitting MPs in droves.
It is also that at heart Emmanuel Macron himself remains something of an enigma.
When he was 22, and already a precocious high-flier, the president spent several months as the amanuensis of one of France's then most respected philosophers, Paul Ricoeur.
The name will mean little to most people, but according to the experts, one of the key elements of Ricoeurian philosophy is the ""ability to think at the same time two ideas that are apparently opposed"".
For example - in a political context - that could mean supporting the freeing up of the labour market and protecting the most vulnerable. Or slimming down the state and ensuring that France's social contract remains intact.
The heart of the philosophy is a generous one: the recognition that neither side in an argument holds a monopoly of the truth, and that the best policies are ones that combine some elements of both.
Macron's adherence to this scheme of thought was most obvious in the pre-presidential debates, when his use of the phrase ""au mÃªme temps"" (at the same time) was much noted upon - implying as it did a constant bid to reconcile apparently contradictory ideas.
All this is very well - and his sincere desire to bring together left and right no doubt contributed greatly to his success.
But the enigma is this: when it comes to acting, rather than talking, which way will the president jump?
After all, the problems he will face in the coming months will be the classic ones that face all democratic leaders. Should I give way to demonstrators? Or should I use force to enact my manifesto? How do I balance the budget? Which is worse, a massive deficit or cuts in social spending?
Or on another current issue: should I give way to the human rights lobby and provide accommodation to the new Calais refugees?  Or should I be hard-headed and turn them away, because housing them only encourages more?
On these and a host of other questions, no-one really knows the president's thinking.
He has promised to leave the old left and right behind, but maybe the old left and right don't want to go away. And maybe not everything is reconcilable by his magnificent Elysian fiat.
What we have seen so far is an object lesson in how to win power, carried out by a truly remarkable individual, who is half Machiavelli, and half Cary Grant. But that story is over now.  Let the new story begin.","So the legislatives have been won, and the final part of what future history books will record as the Macronian conquest is complete.",40322516

Immediately after the shooting, Mr Scott's daughter posted a Facebook Live video from the scene, in which she angrily accused officers of shooting her father ""for being black"".
""He got out of his car, he walked back to comply, and all his compliance did was get him murdered,"" said Taheshia Williams, whose balcony overlooks the car park where Mr Scott was sitting on Tuesday afternoon.
Officers have not said if Mr Scott pointed the gun towards them, but insist that he posed a threat even if he had not.
In the footage, Rakeyia Scott tells her husband to get out of his car as Charlotte police surround him.
The clip does not show the actual shooting, or make clear if Mr Scott was carrying a gun, as police say.
An officer is heard shouting: ""Hands up!""
Mrs Scott cries: ""Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him. He has no weapon.
""He has no weapon. Don't shoot him.""
An officer says: ""Don't shoot. Drop the gun. Drop the [expletive] gun.""
Ms Scott says: ""He doesn't have a gun. He has a TBI [Traumatic Brain Injury].""
She adds: ""He just took his medicine.""
After shots ring out, she rushes forward shouting: ""Did you shoot him? He better not be [expletive] dead!""
Mr Scott's neighbours knew him as a ""family man"" with seven children.
Several recalled how he would sit in his car in order to be out of the sun while he waited for his son to return from school.
Neighbours said that he had a disability caused by a bicycle accident, which would cause him to have seizures if he was too hot.
Officer Vinson, 26, grew up in Charlotte and joined the same police force where his father had worked.
His American football coaches said that he dreamed of becoming a federal police officer.
He enrolled in the police academy in July 2014 and was assigned to Charlotte's Metro Division later that year.
He has not previously faced any disciplinary actions, according to police personnel files, and was placed on administrative leave following the shooting.","Two opposing narratives are being told in Charlotte, North Carolina, where 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott was shot to death by police on Tuesday.",37442521
"Ten Protestant men were shot by the IRA in County Armagh in 1976, in an attack known as the Kingsmills massacre.
An inquest has been told the original Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) investigation was short of manpower.
The court also heard RUC Special Branch denied police detectives permission to question a number of prime suspects.
The Kingsmills victims were travelling home from their jobs in a textile factory when an IRA gang ambushed their minibus.
The gunmen ordered the only Catholic man on board the bus to leave the scene, before lining up the Protestants and opening fire.
More than 150 bullets were fired at the defenceless men - 10 died and one survived but was very seriously injured.
The RUC's investigation was led by Det Ch Insp James Mitchell, an experienced officer who had joined the police force in 1959.
He rose from the rank of constable to a leading position in the RUC's Criminal Investigation Department, investigating some of Northern Ireland's most grisly murders.
Giving evidence to the inquest in Belfast, Mr Mitchell said that he arrived at the scene of the murders within 20 minutes of receiving the emergency call.
He was greeted with what he described in court as ""one of the most gruesome murder scenes of the Troubles"".
Mr Mitchell said that while responsibility for the attack was originally claimed by a group calling itself the South Armagh Republican Action Force, he had no doubt it had been carried out by Provisional IRA members from north County Louth and south County Armagh.
The former officer faced questions over the RUC's handling of the investigation - including issues that had been raised in a 2011 review of the case by the Historical Enquiries Team.
Mr Mitchell told the court that he required between 40 and 50 detectives to work on such a huge murder investigation, but the maximum he was given was 12 detectives and two sergeants.
He said that from ballistics reports, the RUC knew that 11 weapons had been used in the Kingsmills attack - some of which had also been used in a string of other IRA murders.
These included the IRA gun attack on Tullyvallen Orange hall in 1975, which led to the deaths of five men.
A barrister acting for some of the families of the Kingsmills victims questioned Mr Mitchell about claims that the RUC failed to interview a number of witnesses.
The former officer confirmed that the RUC had planned to interview a suspected IRA man but RUC Special Branch officers denied them access to the suspect.
The court also heard that the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) had reported a sighting of a hijacked van - which was believed to have been used by the Kingsmills gunmen - parked outside the home of another suspected IRA member.
Mr Mitchell was asked why that man not brought in for questioning but he was unable to explain the decision.
The former detective was also asked why his officers had apparently failed to respond to a number of entries in the RUC's serious incident log.
One entry related to a phone call from a young woman who told police she saw a large group of men behind a shop in County Armagh on the afternoon of the Kingmills attack.
The court heard she was also able to describe the hijacked van used by the gunmen.
Mr Mitchell said he could not say why her report did not appear to have been acted on by the RUC.
The inquest also heard that the RUC failed to trace or question several eyewitnesses who came across the scene in the aftermath of the attack.
These included three men described in court as ""potentially important witnesses"" and a woman who gave a lift to the Catholic man who the gunmen had ordered to flee the scene.
The court heard that the woman, who had been driving a small car, brought the man back to his home after the shootings.
However, she was never identified let alone interviewed to check if she could help with the investigation.
Speaking outside court, Colin Wharton - who lost his brother in the Kingsmills attack - described the failures in the RUC investigation as ""staggering"".",The detective who led the investigation into the Kingsmills murders has faced questions over failures to trace and interview potentially vital witnesses.,40047047
"More than 1,000 schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have signed up to a project putting them in touch with local employers.
The National Association of Head Teachers says it wants to raise the aspirations of children.
Education Secretary Nicky Morgan says the project will ""inspire children"" to think about different opportunities.
There have been widespread calls for improvements to careers advice in school - the education secretary recently saying that this had been overlooked for too long.
A report from an advisory body set up by the government said last month that careers services for young people needed to be urgently improved.
The Primary Futures project has been launched by head teachers, with the Education and Employers Taskforce, to develop a scheme to link schools with the workplace.
NAHT general-secretary Russell Hobby says that primary school children are ""right at the age where they are beginning to develop their aspirations and ambitions"".
The project will create links between schools and employers, providing primary teachers with people they can invite to talk about their jobs.
A survey for the head teachers' union found that there was widespread demand from primary schools to make connections with local employers - if it was straightforward to arrange.
They were also keen to have careers links which could show pupils the value of improving their skills in literacy and numeracy.
Primary Future is promising a wide range of potential job types to invite into schools, from ""archaeologists to zoologists"".
CBI director-general John Cridland said he wanted all businesses to ""increase their engagement with schools because they have a key role to play in raising ambition and inspiring pupils to pursue exciting careers"".
""We know that even at an early age, the more that young people get an understanding of and interest in the workplace and different jobs, the better they will be prepared for life outside the school gates,"" said Mr Cridland.
Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said: ""We want schools to connect with industry and the business community in order to inspire children to consider the vast array of different opportunities available to them.""
Getting people from different types of jobs into school ""will help to show children what they could achieve and that no occupation should be closed to them because of their gender. It is exciting to see schools taking the initiative in this way,"" said the education secretary.",Head teachers want primary school pupils to learn more about the links between learning and the world of work.,29616978
"The new measures, which will ensure compensation is paid to victims, are contained in the Modern Slavery Bill, which was announced in the Queen's Speech on Wednesday.
The bill would change the maximum jail sentence from 14 years to life.
The Home Office wants the bill to become law before the general election.
The initial version of the bill, published last year, was criticised by a parliamentary committee for being a ""cut and paste job"" of existing offences.
Since then that committee, led by Frank Field MP, has made a series of amendments which place a much stronger focus on victims.
Under the proposed law, courts will be able to demand that offenders with assets pay compensation for the exploitation and loss of dignity that slavery victims have suffered.
The bill could also enforce a statutory defence against the prosecution of victims who have been compelled to commit crimes after being trafficked or held against their will.
The Anti-Slavery Day Act 2010, which established an annual anti-slavery day to raise awareness of the issue, described slavery as including:
Currently victims are liable for prosecution if there is evidence to prove that they have been involved in illegal acts such as prostitution or cultivation of drugs.
Modern slavery can include men, women and children who are brought into the country from overseas and forced to work in illegal brothels or immigrants who are forced to work in cannabis farms, the Home Office said.
It can also include vulnerable people forced to work in any number of industries, from farms to nail bars, against their will.
""Sandra"", 24, was 13 when her grandmother died. She was taken to work for a woman in Uganda as a housemaid but soon found herself being regularly raped by the lady's husband.
When she was 17, a friend of the couple she was living with took Sandra to England. She was told she had to sleep with men and could not return to Uganda until she had paid back the cost of bringing her to the UK.
A few months later, she was taken to another house by a man who said he had paid for her. Other men would visit the house regularly and she was only allowed to leave her room to go to the toilet.
The man later abandoned her on the side of the road when she fell pregnant. It was the first time she had been outdoors in the UK. She was helped by a passer-by and given help by the Salvation Army.
You can listen to an interview with Sandra here.
The independent think tank Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) welcomed the bill being included in the Queen's Speech.
Its director Christian Guy said: ""There are high hopes that this new bill will force modern slavery from the shadows and bring Britain's fight against it into the 21st Century.""
A Home Office spokesman echoed his sentiments and said: ""We want to ensure that victims of this horrendous crime get the reparation they deserve.
""The bill will also strengthen action against the criminals involved in this disgusting trade in human beings to prevent them from ruining any further lives.""
The new measures - which the Home Office has said will be the first of its kind in Europe - will only apply specifically to England and Wales, but ministers have previously said they wanted it to have the ""broadest UK-wide effect"".
A consultation process on slavery and human trafficking has recently closed on 15 April in Northern Ireland, and the results are yet to be published.
The UK and Scottish governments have also previously agreed to work together while ensuring Scotland's ""distinctive approach"" to the issue is maintained.
The plans for a Modern Slavery Bill were first unveiled by Home Secretary Theresa May in August 2013 and the government want to see it enforced before the 2015 general election.

"West Midlands Fire Service (WMFS) has announced two trials to see how services could be protected with fewer staff.
WMFS said the public would see ""no change to the service they receive"" throughout the trials.
The Fire Brigades Union (FBU), warned it would mean fewer firefighters working more hours.
Steve Price-Hunt, acting brigade secretary of the FBU in the West Midlands, said the changes were ultimately expected to lead to 150 frontline cuts, taking the overall number of posts closed to some 400 over five years.
John Edwards, chair of the West Midlands Fire and Rescue Authority, said the trials would ""produce the evidence we need to consider any permanent changes in staffing to deal with another deficit in our budget of £3.5 million that we face in 2016-17"".
He said any long-term job cuts would be made through retirement and there would be no compulsory redundancies.
The two trials approved by the fire service mean watches will be merged at some stations, while others will see the number of staff reduced on each watch.
In the first trial, firefighters are expected to ""self-rota"", rather than being confined to specific shifts.
The FBU said the shift changes could force the service to call in firefighters at late notice to ensure engines were staffed.
Chief Fire Officer Phil Loach said WMFS faced ""extremely challenging cuts"".
A report to the fire authority said £21m in grants had been lost since 2011.
WMFS currently employs 1,322 full-time firefighters, who work from 38 fire stations serving a population of 2.7 million people.

"Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien answered questions at a passionate forum hosted by Swansea City Supporters' Trust.
They admitted making mistakes during last summer's takeover and in the transfer market, but defended Jenkins.
""I expect him to be here a long time,"" said Kaplan. ""He cares about the club deeply.""
Kaplan added: ""Not all his decisions are right, not all my decisions are right decisions, not all Jason's are either.
""But he cares deeply about the club. He was instrumental in getting the club to where it is.
""We have all made mistakes along the way, but Huw is our long-term partner. He's been very open to new ideas and he has been great to work with.""
Kaplan and Levien bought a controlling stake of 68% in the club in July, a transaction which saw selling shareholders such as Jenkins make millions in profit.
The Americans and the existing directors faced stinging criticism from supporters, who called on Jenkins and other selling shareholders to leave during Swansea's poor start to the season.
Fans were also unhappy that the Supporters' Trust, which owns a stake of over 21% in the club, was not fully consulted during last summer's takeover.
Media playback is not supported on this device
With the benefit of hindsight, Levien admitted he and Kaplan would have done things differently - but stood by Jenkins and his fellow directors.
""I think mistakes were made in the acquisition process. Looking back now, I would have liked to engage earlier with the Trust,"" said Levien.
""I cannot speak for the shareholders, but I know for more than a decade they led the club to great success. I think the board who were here during that period deserve respect.""
Swansea have endured a torrid season, plunging to the bottom of the Premier League table earlier in the campaign before finding themselves in their current difficult position of 17th spot, one place and one point above the relegation zone.
Mixed dealings in the transfer window have contributed to that decline, with club-record signing Borja Baston arguably the most disappointing signing with just one goal from 17 appearances in attack since joining from Atletico Madrid for £15m.
""Do I think mistakes were made in recent transfer windows? Sure,"" said Levien.

"Adam Mudd, 20, of Hertfordshire, has already admitted offences under the Computer Misuse Act.
The Old Bailey heard he lives with his parents and the crimes were about ""status"".
He is expected to be sentenced next week.
The court heard Mudd created the Titanium Stresser ""malware"" in 2013, when he was 16 years old, and sold it to cyber criminals across the world.
The programme had 112,000 registered users who were responsible for about  1.7 million ""distributed denial of service"" attacks on websites, including gaming sites such as RuneScape, Minecraft and Xbox Live.
The court heard there were about 25,000 attacks on RuneScape and the company which owns it spent Â£6m trying to defend itself.
Prosecutors said Mudd carried out 594 attacks himself, including one on West Herts College where he was studying computer science.
He also attacked 70 other schools and colleges, including the University of Cambridge, University of Essex and University of East Anglia, as well as local councils.
Mudd had been in his bedroom when he was arrested at his home in Toms Lane, Kings Langley, in March 2015 and he refused to unlock his computer until his father intervened.
Jonathan Polney, prosecuting counsel, said the malware caused ""incalculable"" damage to organisations.
""This is a young man who lived at home. This is not a lavish lifestyle case,"" he said.

"It is hoped the levy will cut the 7.6bn bags given to shoppers at major supermarkets every year, and retailers are expected to spend the money raised from the charge on good causes.
Campaigners have welcomed the move, but called for the law to include all retailers and all types of bags.
England is the last part of the UK to start charging for plastic bags.
The number of plastic bags given out by seven major supermarkets in England rose by 200 million in 2014 to exceed 7.6 billion - the equivalent of 140 per person and amounting to 61,000 tonnes in total.
Brenda Chapman said: ""I can see the logic in charging for supermarket bags but if I buy a book or clothes I expect a bag to transport it home in.""
Raymond in Bedford said: ""Very happy about the charge for plastic bags, they should never have been introduced in the first place. What an environmental disaster they have proven to be.""
Katharine in Poole, Dorset, said: ""In the 1970s, Safeways used to provide paper sacks for free but charge for plastic carriers. Why doesn't the government revert to something like this?""
Plastic bag charge: Five of the most English reactions
The government hopes the English scheme will cut use of plastic carrier bags by up to 80% in supermarkets, and by 50% on the High Street. It also expects to save Â£60m in litter clean-up costs as well as generating Â£730m for good causes over the next decade.
The price hike affects only retailers with 250 or more employees, and unlike schemes in other parts of the UK, paper bags are exempt from a charge.
Smaller shops are exempt from the rule change but may choose to charge shoppers for bags as well.
Free bags will still be provided for consumers buying uncooked meat, poultry or fish, prescription medicine, certain fresh produce such as flowers or potatoes, and unwrapped ready-to-eat food such as chips.
The exemptions mean the move may not be as successful as schemes introduced elsewhere in the UK, campaigners have argued
But Alice Ellison, of the British Retail Consortium, said the charge sent out a ""confusing, complex message"" to customers, adding England should have adopted the same policy as the rest of the UK, where all shops charge for all types of disposable bag.
All you need to know about the 5p charge
A poll for the Break the Bag Habit coalition of litter charities found 62% of shoppers in England - six percentage points higher than in 2012 - thought it was ""reasonable"" to charge 5p for carrier bags.
Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Asda all said customers were reacting positively to the charge, and it was ""business as usual"" in their stores.
Friends of the Earth said the charge would significantly reduce the number of plastic bags being used by shoppers, but also called for it to apply to smaller shops.
Environment minister Rory Stewart said it could make a huge difference, ""meaning we can all enjoy a cleaner, healthier country"".

"However, the cautious recommendations from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) will, initially at least, insist on a fully licensed driver being behind the wheel, ready to take over in an emergency or if the technology fails.
California has been the testing ground for most of the development, and so regulations in the state are considered to be precedent-setting.
Prospective users of self-driving cars will need to undergo special training, and manufacturers would be required to monitor the cars' use.
Answering a common query, regulators said any traffic violations or accidents would remain the responsibility of the human driver.
Many firms are investing heavily in researching and creating self-driving vehicles, such as Ford, Uber and Tesla.
Google, which leads the research field, has made a self-driving car without any controls such as steering wheels or pedals.
But the DMV's proposals would mean such vehicles would not, for the foreseeable future at least, be made available for consumers.
A statement from the DMV read: ""Given the potential risks associated with deployment of such a new technology, DMV believes that manufacturers need to obtain more experience in testing driverless vehicles on public roads prior to making this technology available to the general public.""
Instead, any car offering self-driving capability must also be fitted with traditional controls - such as the adapted Lexus Google has been testing on roads already.
This slightly dampens hopes that self-driving technology would enable those who are currently unable to drive - such as people with disabilities - to get on the roads.
However, the DMV said it would reassess the safety of fully-autonomous vehicles in the future.
A public consultation on the draft will take place in the new year.
The draft also adds requirements for manufacturers to ensure that vehicles are protected from cyber attacks.

"Writing in the Mail on Sunday, David Cameron said the country should be ""far more muscular"" in promoting its values and institutions.
He backed the promotion of ""British values"" in the classroom amid claims conservative Muslim governors had tried to influence some Birmingham schools.
This should include teaching children about Magna Carta, Mr Cameron said.
Mr Cameron wrote that in recent years, the UK had sent out a ""worrying"" message: ""That if you don't want to believe in democracy, that's fine; that if equality isn't your bag, don't worry about it; that if you're completely intolerant of others, we will still tolerate you.
""This has not just led to division, it has also allowed extremism - of both the violent and non-violent kind - to flourish.""
Education Secretary Michael Gove has promised ""decisive action"" after Ofsted inspectors said that in several schools in Birmingham, the governors had wielded ""inappropriate influence"".
Its report followed claims they had sought to influence the ethos and curriculum of schools in the city.
Culture Secretary Sajid Javid warned even a small number of people wielding their influence could have a ""great impact"".
""It's always a small minority that spoils it for everyone and although it's a small number they can have a great impact,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show.
""That's what we've seen in these schools - that's what we're potentially seeing with British people going over to fight in Syria, which I think is unacceptable.""
Mr Javid said he supported the prime minister's plans to take ""a more muscular attitude"" to promoting British values in schools.
But he added that the ""vast majority"" of British Muslims were important parts of the community who played the same roles as others and had tolerance and respect for British values.
In the wake of Ofsted's findings, Mr Cameron said ""British values"" included: ""A belief in freedom, tolerance of others, accepting personal and social responsibility, respecting and upholding the rule of law.""
These were ""as British as the Union Flag, as football, as fish and chips,"" he wrote in the newspaper article.
The Muslim Council of Britain said it had ""deep concern at the tone and tenor over the debate on British values"".
In a motion passed at its AGM, the MCB said it had ""no objection to British values"" and believed in a ""tolerant, more free and more equal society"".
But it said it wanted a ""real debate that does not regard us as conditional Britons.... It is not Islam or Muslims that stand in the way of full participation; It is the active and vociferous campaign to exclude Muslims from the public space.""
In 2015 it will be 800 years since King John put his seal on the Magna Carta, the document which first established the king was subject to the law.
Mr Cameron said he wanted all pupils to take lessons on the charter to mark the anniversary.
""The remaining copies... may have faded,"" he wrote. ""But its principles shine as brightly as ever, and they paved the way for the democracy, the equality, the respect and the laws that make Britain, Britain.""
Mr Cameron said he also wanted ""towns to commemorate it [and] for events to celebrate it.""","People in the UK should stop being ""bashful"" about being British, the prime minister has urged.",27853591
"The current £1 coin will be discontinued this year, as a 12-sided coin enters circulation on 28 March.
Asset manager M&G has calculated that, if left in a piggy bank, inflation since 1983 would have corroded its buying power to the equivalent of 32p.
Investing in shares would brought a much higher return, it said.
If the £1 had been invested in shares in 1983 and tracked the rise in the FTSE all-share index, it would have had a value of £11.66 by the end of 2016, after allowing for inflation. This would have required any income to be reinvested each month - to make the most of compounding over time.
Ritu Vohora, investment director at M&G, said that the replacement of the old round pound coin was a ""timely reminder"" of the corrosive effects of inflation - the rising cost of living. Any investment carries a risk of losing money, unlike saving, but Ms Vohora argued that there were potential rewards.
""Our analysis shows that you can turn even a modest investment into a healthy pot of money if you are willing to accept an element of risk and are in a position to make a long-term investment,"" she said.
This investment in shares would outstrip investing in gold, which would have had a real value of £1.05 by the end of 2016, and a cash savings account (real value of £1.33).
However, the appeal of shares over cash was challenged by Susan Hannums, director at independent savings advice site Savingschampion.co.uk.
""For some people, cash is the most appropriate asset to hold, certainly for some of their money, but it should still be looked after properly to make sure that it works as hard as possible,"" she said.
""The secret to making sure that cash is not a wasted asset, is to keep switching in order to ensure it is earning the best rates of interest possible. This can prove invaluable.""
The M&G calculations suggest that investing one pound in government bonds would have seen it grow to a real value of £4.93 by the end of 2016.
Putting the money in UK residential property would have seen the real value grow to £2.42 over the same period, M&G said.
However, this only measured the growth in value of property which, unlike shares, could not be reinvested each month, so this comparison is questionable.

"The left-wing MP said politics should be ""comradely and friendly"".
Former Cabinet minister Alan Milburn followed Tony Blair in warning against a victory for Mr Corbyn, saying Labour had a ""death wish"" if it shifted left.
Another candidate, Liz Kendall, said a win for Mr Corbyn - who topped a recent poll - would be a ""disaster"".
Labour party donor John Mills told the Guardian the election of Mr Corbyn could trigger an ""SDP-style split"" and the withdrawal of support from wealthy donors.
The Labour row comes after a YouGov poll for the Times that put left-winger Mr Corbyn ahead in the race and Ms Kendall fourth.
Mr Blair has warned the party would not win from a left-wing position, and one of his former advisers said MPs who helped Mr Corbyn onto the ballot paper but did not support him were ""morons"".
Asked about the criticism, Mr Corbyn told the BBC: ""I think politics should be conducted on a comradely and friendly basis, and if people disagree with each other then say what they disagree on, and let's keep these silly remarks to themselves.""
Ms Kendall dismissed calls for her to withdraw from the contest to ensure Mr Corbyn is beaten.
She told the BBC: ""I'll be fighting for what I believe in until the very end.""
She said a victory for Mr Corbyn would be a ""disaster"", saying that turning back to the politics of the 1980s and losing elections ""does nothing to help the people"" the party wants to help.
At-a-glance profiles of the four contenders
Mr Milburn told the BBC the party would only win the next election if it occupied the centre ground.
He added: ""The alternative is that Labour lurches to the left.  If it does that, frankly, it has a death wish.""
Mr Mills, a donor to the Kendall campaign, told the Guardian: ""If Corbyn won, I suspect what would happen is that there would be some sort of split.
""Then you would have an SDP-type party"" - a reference to the Social Democratic Party formed in 1981 by Labour party defectors.
Mr Mills said he suspected ""some of the major donors"" would be ""less likely to give"".
The YouGov poll suggested Mr Corbyn could receive 43% of first preference votes, ahead of Andy Burnham on 26%, Yvette Cooper on 20% and Ms Kendall on 11%.
In a subsequent poll, for Ipsos Mori, 27% of the general public said Mr Burnham would be a good prime minister, compared to 22% for Ms Cooper, 17% for Mr Corbyn and 16% for Ms Kendall.
Mr Burnham also led among Labour supporters.
On Tuesday, former prime minister Mr Blair warned Labour would not win again from a ""traditional leftist platform"".
He also said people who had Mr Corbyn's politics at heart should ""get a transplant"".

"Edinburgh University scientists examined the effects of testosterone on blood vessel tissue and found it triggered the production of hard deposits or calcification.
The deposits ""powerfully"" predict the chance of death or major problems due to heart disease, they said.
During the study mice had testosterone receptors removed.
The mice then produced fewer hard deposits as they could no longer respond to the hormone.
Calcification causes blood vessels to harden and thicken, making the heart work harder to pump blood around the body.
It can also affect the valves of the heart, preventing them opening and shutting properly.
The authors said their findings suggested testosterone played a role in calcification and the discovery may lead to new treatments to prevent heart disease.
Researchers also examined blood vessel and valve tissue from people with heart disease.
They found tissue cells containing the hard bone-like deposits also carried the testosterone receptor.
This further suggested that testosterone may trigger calcification, they said.
At least 119,000 men are admitted to hospital every year suffering a heart attack, compared to 69,000 women.
Dr Vicky MacRae, from the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute, said: ""Calcification is particularly difficult to treat, as the biological processes behind the disease are similar to those used by our body to make and repair bone.
""By finding this link between testosterone and calcification we may have discovered a new way of treating this disease and also reducing heart disease.
""This is a new pathway that hasn't really been examined before in the formation of calcification in the cardiac tissue.
""We hope that by understanding in more detail the pathways that are contributing to this, we may be able to work out therapies in future that may be able to target it and prevent calcification from happening, because at the moment there is no real therapy available to stop these calcium deposits from forming in blood vessels and heart valves.""
Prof  Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""The role of male sex hormones in the control of vascular calcification is poorly understood.
""This study, in cells taken from mice and human tissue, provides new evidence that testosterone can increase calcification.
""But significantly more research is needed to understand whether the results have implications for patients with heart disease or those taking androgen (testosterone) replacement therapy.""
Funded by the British Heart Foundation (BHF) and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), the study was published in the journal Scientific Reports.","Testosterone may be one of the reasons why men are more prone to heart attacks than women, according to new research.",36100525

Russian prosecutors accuse Mr Ashurkov of stealing contributions to Navalny's campaign for the 2013 Moscow mayoral elections. Navalny failed in his bid. He is under house arrest in Moscow.
Navalny, a vociferous critic of President Vladimir Putin, has rejected allegations that Mr Ashurkov did anything wrong.
Ms Markvo is also being prosecuted by Russian authorities. She is accused of embezzlement in connection with a Moscow book festival.

"Margaret Christopher, 81, of Southport, Lancashire, was part-way through a six-and-a-half hour drive to west Wales when she collided with David England's car at Lovesgrove near Aberystwyth.
Swansea Crown Court heard she drove straight on at a left-hand curve.
She admitted causing death by dangerous driving and was given a 14-month jail sentence, suspended for two years.
Prosecutor Francis Jones told the court Christopher, then aged 80, was en route to her daughter's home in Broad Haven, Pembrokeshire, to look after her daughter's dog while she went on holiday in March 2015.
She had taken two breaks already, the last one at Machynlleth - about 18 miles (29km) away - but felt she needed another one and had been looking for a layby to stop at when the collision occurred.
Mr England, 67, was initially conscious and able to talk to emergency services but died at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff two days later from injuries to his heart and central nervous system.
His daughter Rhian England, a passenger in the front seat, suffered fractures to her arm and leg and spent three months in a wheelchair.
The court heard doctors had thought Christopher would also die in the first two days after the crash, and she had no recollection of what had happened or why.
Mr Jones said other drivers thought Christopher had not even tried to take the bend and there was no sign she had braked.
Both cars were in good condition, the road was well-surfaced and the weather was fine while speed was not a factor, Mr Jones said.

"Denbighshire councillors agreed a new round of cuts to reduce their spending by £17m over the next two years.
It includes cutting £100,000 to finance a music service helping youth ensembles like Denbighshire Youth Brass Band.
The conductor told the audience in Rhyl  that the band's future was uncertain.
""No one asked us what should be done,"" John Powell told BBC Wales.
One parent, who did not want to be named, criticised the timing given the budget meeting earlier on Tuesday.
""The kids are devastated,"" she said before the concert. ""And now they want them to come out and play Jingle Bells.""
The brass band and Denbighshire Youth Choir played at the council fund raising carol service at St Thomas' Church.
In November parents presented Denbighshire council with a petition of nearly 4,000 names in support of the work of William Mathias Music Service to run the council's music service and ensembles for 190 children.
The council said the services were in addition to school music lessons, which all children will continue to receive.
It has also said it ""would potentially consider alternative ways of providing this type of opportunity for children and young people"" so it is not yet clear what the future holds for the ensembles.
On Tuesday, council chairman Brian Blakeley said he had received letters and social media messages from children and parents about the cuts.
He said his role as chairman was meant to be impartial and that although he shared their concerns, savings had to be found from somewhere.
But he said there may still be some hope as the budget will not be formally accepted until February.
He described the concert as ""fantastic"" and that while Mr Powell had been ""very blunt"" when they met for the first time at the concert, the pair were going to meet to try to move forward.
Meanwhile, protesters gathered outside the Scala cinema and arts centre in Prestatyn earlier on Tuesday to make their feelings known as the cutbacks mean it will lose its subsidy.
The council still needs to find £7m more savings over the next two years.

"The South Korean firm has not issued a recall of its Galaxy Note 7 in China, despite local media reports of two devices catching fire.
Samsung said it had concluded that the damage was caused by ""external heating"" so a recall was not necessary.
The vast majority of Note 7s sold in China were equipped with batteries made by a local supplier.
The callbacks elsewhere have been linked to faulty batteries made by Samsung itself.
China is the world's largest smartphone market and of key importance to manufacturers.
On 2 September, Samsung issued a recall of 2.5 million phones in certain countries, leaving out China.
The firm said in a statement that the phones sold there did not have the battery manufacturing error that has caused fires in dozens of phones in other places.
Samsung also assured customers that the Galaxy Note 7s in China that went on sale after 1 Sept were ""safe to use"".
In the last week, Chinese media have reported that two of the devices appeared to have caught fire. Pictures posted online appeared to show charred Note 7 devices.
Some Chinese consumers said Samsung's lack of action showed that it was biased against China.
""Caused by external heating? The heat of a person's body temperature can cause a phone to explode. Sure,"" said one user sarcastically on micro-blogging site Weibo.
""Samsung doesn't dare raise a fuss overseas but in China as soon as explosions are mentioned they blame other people,"" another person commented.
""China is a big market. Be careful Samsung, don't bully China,"" warned one user.
""I think consumers are pretty unhappy with Samsung,"" Ben Cavender of China Market Research Group told the Associated Press news agency.
He said Chinese consumers ""start to feel like they are being taken advantage of, that they are not being accorded the same respect here as they are abroad"".
In June, Swedish furniture company Ikea suffered a similar backlash after it recalled dressers in the US and Canada but failed to do so immediately in China. It announced a Chinese recall in July.
The Chinese battery supplier for Note 7 phones sold in China said the fires appeared to be different from those in other countries.
""We believe the heat problem comes from outside the battery. A very large likelihood exists that other factors gave rise to the heat problem,"" said Amperex Technology Ltd.
The company gave no further explanation of what might have caused the problems.
Samsung said it had investigated the first phone that was reported to have caught fire, but was unable to obtain the phone involved in the second incident.
Reports of Samsung recalling 1,858 phones also emerged on 14 September.
Chinese state newspaper People's Daily said it was ""insincere"" of Samsung to recall almost 2,000 units in China but ""one million in the United States"".

The judge started her charge to the jury on Monday at the High Court in Glasgow and told them to keep ""cool heads"" as they consider all the evidence in the case.
The Crown alleges the 46-year-old pretended to then-owner Sir David Murray that funds were ""immediately available"" on an ""unconditional basis"" to make all required payments for a controlling and majority stake in the Glasgow club.
Advocate Depute Alex Prentice QC has told the court Whyte did not have authority over the funds used in the takeover and ""induced"" the Murray Group to sell, but defence QC Donald Findlay described the accused as ""the fall guy"" in the case.
Lady Stacey laid out the verdicts available - guilty, not guilty and not proven - and told the jurors to have a ""good, hard look at what has been put before you"".
Asking the jury to retire, the judge said: ""You have listened patiently to all of the evidence and must have as much time as you do require.""",The jury in the trial of former Rangers owner Craig Whyte have been sent to consider their verdict after six weeks of evidence.,40170904
"An editorial in The Lancet Neurology says these decisions should not be made ""by those with a vested interest"".
FIFPro, the footballers' union, has called for an investigation into concussion protocols.
This follows incidents during the World Cup where footballers played on after appearing to be concussed.
""Because signs and symptoms of concussion can be delayed, removing an athlete when there is any suspicion of injury would seem to be the safest approach,"" the journal editors wrote.
They refer to a recent World Cup group match against England, when Uruguay's Alvaro Pereira returned to the pitch after appearing to be knocked unconscious by a blow to the head.
Pereira admitted to arguing with his team doctor, demanding that he should be allowed to continue playing.
The editors make the point that the decision on the player's ""fitness to play"" should not have been left in the hands of the Uruguayan team doctor and team officials.
Instead, ""return-to-play decisions should be made on an individual basis"", they said.
In the World Cup semi-final between Argentina and the Netherlands, Javier Mascherano stumbled about and then collapsed on the pitch after clashing heads with a Dutch player.
Despite appearing to suffer concussion, the Argentinean midfielder returned to the fray just minutes later.
Fifa has been criticised for failing to deal with the incidents safely, by ensuring that the players were immediately taken off the pitch and removed from the game.
While many sporting organisations now recognise the potential damage that mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause, the writers said more needs to be done to reduce how often these injuries occur.
Improving the assessment, monitoring and care of adults and children with sports-related concussion should also be a priority, it states.
Mr Antonio Belli, reader in neurotrauma at the University of Birmingham, said players don't understand how dangerous concussion can be.
""When players return to the pitch and continue playing, they are sending out the wrong message. There are lots of medical reasons not to continue.""
The long-term consequences of mild traumatic brain injuries can include dementia and other neurological degenerative diseases.
Headaches and dizziness can appear in the short-term.
What is concussion?
Concussion is an abnormal brain function that results from an external blast, jolt or impact to the head. Even if the knock does not result in a skull fracture, the brain can still experience a violent rattling that leads to injury.
What happens?
Because the brain is a soft gelatinous material surrounded by a rigid bony skull, such traumatic injuries can cause changes in brain function, such as bleeding, neuron damage and swelling. Research shows that repetitive concussions increase the risk of sustained memory loss, worsened concentration or prolonged headaches.","Decisions on whether a footballer can return to the pitch after a head injury should be taken by an independent doctor, and not the player or coach.",28262874
"The German financial services giant said its net income was 755m euros (Â£608m), hit by a larger tax bill, compared to 777m euros in the same quarter last year.
For the year so far, Deutsche Bank's profits have declined from 2011.
Net revenues grew by 18% to 8.7bn euros due to ""improved market conditions and increased market activity"".
Much of that came from corporate banking and securities trading.
""The European markets saw marked stabilisation in the third quarter of 2012 - compared with a very tense environment in the first half of the year,"" the bank said.
The results come as a European Union advisory group said earlier this month that Europe's banks should be split into separate legal entities, in order to protect ordinary retail banking from risky trading.
The EU is also moving towards banking union within the eurozone and is planning to have a eurozone-wide regulatory system, the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), which it hopes will begin its work by the start of next year.
It would allow the ECB to assume full supervisory responsibility over any credit institution, particularly those which have received or requested public funding, with all banks covered by the SSM by the start of 2014.

"On 31st December, the festivities hit places around the world at slightly different times too, due to the time differences across the world.
Check out the video below to find out how it works.
Some cultures may celebrate New Year at a different time to 31st December, because they use a different calendar to the UK.
Generally, whenever they take place, New Year traditions are designed to bring luck and good fortune in the year ahead.
Find out below how people may be celebrating the start of 2017 all over the world.
One of the most popular ways to celebrate seeing in the New Year is with big fireworks displays.
These take place all over the world, as different countries hit midnight.
In New Zealand, crowds gather at Auckland Sky Tower in the capital for an impressive fireworks display, and the same happens in Sydney Harbour in Australia.
In Toronto in Canada, people gather in Nathan Phillips Square, while in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, people flock to the city's famous Copacabana beach to watch the sky being lit up by fireworks.
If you came out of your front door to find a load of smashed plates, you might be a bit confused.
But that's exactly what people in Denmark hope to find after midnight, as it means good luck.
So, if you were Danish, you might go and smash a plate on a friend's doorstep to bring good luck over the next 12 months.
In Brazil, there is a tradition to eat lentils at New Year, as these represent money - meaning good fortune for the year ahead!
In New York in the US, huge crowds of people head to Times Square to count down to midnight.
But the thing that everyone is looking forward to is called the ball drop, which is when a glowing ball is lowered down a big flagpole, to signal the start of the new year.
As a result, other cities in the US now have their own traditions of dropping things on New Year's Eve.
In Vincennes in Indiana, people drop watermelons from high up!
In Scotland, people go ""first-footing"", which is where they aim to be the first person to step foot in their friends' or family's homes after the clock has struck midnight.
You might take a gift if you go to do this.
Don't try this at home yourself!
In some countries including Finland, there is a tradition of melting a special metal and dropping it in cold water. The metal will make a shape in the water when it cools.
People then try to read the shape of the metal to tell them something about their future.
For example, if it makes the shape of a flower, it could mean they have an unknown admirer.
When the clocks hit midnight in Spain, you'll find people reaching for grapes.
This is because there is a tradition to eat one grape each time the clock strikes at midnight.
The idea is that this will bring you 12 lucky months in the year ahead.
In Romania, there's a tradition for people to dress up as dancing bears to chase away any evil spirits.
This is because bears are special according to old Romanian stories and are able to protect and heal people.
Some countries, like Japan and South Korea, ring bells to start the New Year.
In Japan, the bells are rung 108 times, so you can expect it to be quite noisy!
In Johannesburg in South Africa, people like to start the year without any unwanted items.
They do this by throwing old furniture out of the window.
In some South American countries, you might see some people on New Year's Eve walking around with an empty suitcase.
Some believe that taking what is called a ""suitcase walk"" means they will have a year full of adventures ahead.",People celebrate New Year in a number of ways.,38341760
"Alex Neil said ministers would also look to reduce the stress of applying for social security.
Responsibility for a number of benefits is being devolved to MSPs as part of the new Scotland Bill.
They include the Carer's Allowance and benefits for the disabled such as the Disability Living Allowance.
Just over 15% of welfare spending north of the border will be devolved, with the legislation also giving the parliament in Edinburgh the power to create new benefits and top up existing payments.
Mr Neil will use a debate on Tuesday to set out the key principles that will underpin the Scottish government approach to welfare - that social security is an investment in the people of Scotland, with respect for the individual at the heart of the system.
Holyrood ministers also stress welfare services will be ""evidence based"", and provide value for money, while ""putting people first"" will be central to all policies, processes and systems.
Mr Neil said: ""With our new social security powers we have the opportunity to take a different approach and develop policies for Scotland which will help to remove the stigma attached to accessing benefits.
""These policies will be based on principles which will ensure people are treated with dignity and respect. We want to show that social security can be fairer, tackle inequalities, and protect and support the vulnerable in our society.""
""It's understandable that people who receive benefits, who are ill, retired or disabled, will be concerned about how these changes will affect them.
""I want to reassure them that our priority is for them to receive their benefits on time and with the right amount.""
He added: ""We want to ease some of the stress of applying for benefits and will make the system easier and simpler to navigate, and align it with our devolved services that support people.""","The Scottish government wants to use new welfare powers to help remove the stigma attached to claiming benefits, the social justice secretary has said.",35681735
"Clough was granted permission to speak to Forest, for whom he played more than 300 games and scored 131 goals, and who his father Brian Clough also managed.
But the 50-year-old has chosen to stay at the side he helped reach the second tier for the first time last season.
""Staying is the right thing to do,"" Clough said, with his 20th-placed Burton just one position behind Forest.
""Having started this historic season in the Championship it is only right that we should stay and continue the job of trying to achieve the miracle of keeping Burton Albion in the Championship.""
Forest are looking to replace Philippe Montanier, who was sacked on 14 January.
Clough is in his second spell as Brewers boss and, like his father and Forest legend Brian, has also managed Derby County.
The Brewers climbed out of the Championship relegation zone with Saturday's 2-1 victory over QPR, a day after Clough met with his chairman Ben Robinson to discuss Forest's approach.
He said it would be a ""difficult"" decision, but added to BBC Radio Derby: ""It would be naive for me to suggest there is no interest in a club I have had such a long association with.""
Robinson confirmed on Monday that there was an agreement between the club and Clough that if Forest made an approach, Burton would allow the parties to talk.
""Now we are happy to report that he will be staying at the Pirelli Stadium,"" said Robinson.
""Nigel and his backroom team have been fully focused on the job of keeping Burton Albion in the Championship.

"A doctors' panel told the court that, at 32 weeks, termination of the pregnancy would be ""too risky"".
Her pregnancy was discovered two weeks ago when she complained of stomach ache and her parents took her to hospital.
A lower court had earlier turned down her plea on similar grounds.
Without disclosing the details of the medical report, the judges on Friday ruled that termination was ""not good for the girl"".
They have asked the government-run Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research hospital in the northern city of Chandigarh to ensure that proper medical care is provided to her.
The top court has also suggested that the Indian government set up a permanent medical board in each state to take prompt decisions in such cases.
On Monday, the Supreme Court had ordered doctors to evaluate whether the girl could undergo abortion safely.
The court order came after lawyer Alakh Alok Srivastava filed a public interest petition saying doctors who had already examined the girl found her pelvic bones had not fully developed because of her age and the life of both mother and baby were at ""very serious risk"".
""Medical experts have categorically opined that if the 10-year-old is forced to give birth, either through normal delivery or even through caesarean-section, it may be fatal to the life of the rape survivor as well as to her child,"" the petition said.
The girl belongs to an extremely poor family, her father is a government employee and mother works as a domestic helper. The girl alleges she was raped several times in the past seven months by her uncle, who has been arrested.
Her pregnancy was only recently discovered because she herself was unaware of her condition.
Indian law does not allow terminations after 20 weeks unless doctors confirm the mother's life is in danger.
Sources: Indian government, Unicef
The tough law against abortion was introduced in 1971 to prevent illegal and unsafe abortions and curb maternal mortality.
The restrictions remain an important weapon in India's fight against a skewed gender ratio which has resulted from a deep-seated cultural preference for sons.
Millions of female foetuses have been aborted over the years by pregnant women after undergoing foetal gender testing.
In recent years, Indian courts have received several petitions, many from child rape survivors, seeking to terminate pregnancies after 20 weeks, the BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi says.
In most such cases, the pregnancy is not even discovered until after the 20-week period is over because the children are themselves unaware of their condition, our correspondent adds.
In May, a court in Haryana state asked medical experts to comment on a similar plea and a panel of doctors decided to carry out a termination.
Medical experts say girls can start menstruating and ovulating at nine, but their bodies are not mature enough for pregnancy at that age.
India is home to the largest number of sexually abused children globally, with some campaigners saying it has reached epidemic proportions. But there is a general reluctance to talk about the problem and it is rarely discussed in public.
Studies have shown that in large numbers of cases the abusers are known to the children and include care-givers like parents, relatives and teachers.","India's Supreme Court has refused to allow an abortion for a 10-year-old girl, allegedly raped by her uncle, on the grounds that she is too far into her pregnancy.",40753409

The shots, which feature the artist in poses including standing with a giant sunflower, were not published at the time and remained unseen until 2012.

"He has been accused of trying to obstruct a corruption investigation against him and intimidating lawmakers.
Mr Cunha is an outspoken critic of President Dilma Rousseff and has led an impeachment drive against her.
In a BBC interview, Ms Rousseff has vowed to ""keep fighting"".
Next week, Brazil's Senate is due to vote on whether to launch an impeachment trial against her.
If a simple majority votes in favour, she will be suspended from office for 180 days while Vice-President Michel Temer takes over as interim president.
Under Brazil's constitution, Mr Cunha was the next in line for the presidency after Mr Temer, who is facing impeachment proceedings on charges similar to those facing President Rousseff.
The dramatic suspension of Eduardo Cunha from the lower house of Congress may come too late to save Dilma Rousseff but, be in no doubt, he played a critical role in the process which now sees Brazil's first woman president on the verge of suspension from office.
Dilma Rousseff and her supporters in Congress say it was her government's decision not to give in to the Speaker's demands, specifically over an ethics committee investigation into Mr Cunha, that triggered his subsequent move to begin the impeachment process against the president.
In her wide-ranging BBC interview, while declaring her own innocence, Ms Rousseff was scathing about the man who has emerged as her nemesis.
""The one person responsible forâ€¦ the impeachment request (against me) is himself under charges. He's notorious, known to have foreign bank accounts and is under charges of money laundering and corruption,"" she said.
According to opinion polls, Eduardo Cunha is even more unpopular that the beleaguered president after details of his Swiss bank accounts, which he had earlier denied having, came to light.
Mr Cunha, a committed evangelical Christian who often quotes the Bible in his social media messages, protests his innocence and may find a way back.
He is a talented and well-connected political operator but his chances of perhaps becoming the next president of Brazil, by default as Speaker of Congress, are now almost non-existent.
Ms Rousseff has accused Mr Temer and Mr Cunha, who belong to the opposition PMDB party, of being the ringleaders of  a ""coup attempt"" against her.
Mr Cunha is suspected of obstructing an investigation into allegations he took $5m (Â£3.2m) in bribes from companies seeking to secure contracts with state-oil giant Petrobras, which he denies.

"Relativity Media filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Thursday and will now sell its TV and film arms.
However, it said it would go ahead with the releases of Kristen Wiig's Masterminds and Halle Berry's Kidnap.
But it is less clear what the future holds for around a dozen other films, including Natalie Portman's hotly anticipated western Jane Got A Gun.
Jane Got A Gun, which also stars Joel Edgerton and Ewan McGregor, had been due for release this September, and had been tipped as a possible awards contender.
Deadline reported that Relativity relinquished its share of the film's distribution rights before bankruptcy proceedings began, and that its backers now hope to release it early next year.
Relativity Media was founded in 2004 and was dubbed a ""mini-major"" studio with releases including Oscar-winners The Social Network and The Fighter.
The company also made MTV show Catfish, and said it would press ahead with a number of international versions of the show as well as a sequel called Truce.
TV drama Limitless, based on the Relativity movie of the same name starring Bradley Cooper, will be screened on CBS this year, it added.
Variety reported that the company would also ""move forward"" with a remake of 1994 film The Crow.
But Variety said around a dozen more projects were now up in the air, including The Bronze, which opened this year's Sundance Film Festival; and horrors Before I Wake and The Disappointments Room.
Others reportedly in the pipeline include Autobahn, which sees Nicholas Hoult play a getaway driver; Amanda Seyfried comedy Love the Coopers; Jonathan Rhys Meyers spy thriller Damascus Cover; and Holocaust love story The Lost Wife.
The Lost Wife writer Marc Klein told Variety: ""This isn't something I'd be able to write at a major studio. It's a story that Hollywood could tell and isn't anymore.
""The one company who did is now bankrupt. That's a bummer. They've been nothing but great to me.""
Relativity chief executive Ryan Kavanaugh said: ""We will continue to move forward with a robust production slate of scripted and non-scripted shows during the reorganisation process.""

"The officer, who has since died, used the name Rick Gibson to join Liverpool-based activist group Big Flame.
In 1976, ""Rick"" was forced out of the group amid a ""tirade of abuse"" after members apparently found birth and death records for the real Mr Gibson.
The details were released by a judge-led inquiry into undercover policing.
The Undercover Policing Inquiry is being led by Sir John Mitting. It was previously led by Sir Christopher Pitchford, who has now retired.
For two years it has reported on undercover police operations conducted by police forces in England and Wales since 1968.
In this case, the officer had tried to explain to campaigners that he adopted a pseudonym to ""avoid detection and arrest"" because he was ""wanted"" by police.
""No violence was used, but he was expelled from the group after a lengthy tirade of abuse,"" a Metropolitan Police risk assessment compiled for the inquiry said.
Big Flame, which described itself as a ""revolutionary socialist feminist organisation"", was set up in 1970 but had largely disbanded by the mid-1980s.
After the incident, the policeman was withdrawn as an undercover officer in the Special Demonstration Squad - the secretive Met unit responsible for infiltrating protest groups.
The document included details of three officers who used cover names, revealed by the inquiry after the Met decided not to oppose their disclosure.
One undercover officer used the pseudonym Douglas Edwards, and was deployed to gather information on the Independent Labour Party and the left-wing groups, Tri-Continental and the Dambusters Mobilising Committee.
The document said the government was concerned about the risk of ""large-scale public disorder"" and that the officer, who was deployed between 1968 and 1971, posed as a ""long-distance lorry driver"".
In a personal statement, the second policeman, who has since retired and did not want his real name to be revealed, said he was initially told to report on anarchist groups.
""Some of them were quite nasty pieces of work,"" he wrote.
He said problems linked to undercover policing were ""blown out of all proportion"", but added: ""Other people have fathered children and you can't have that.""
In 2014, the Met paid Â£425,000 in compensation to a woman who did not know the father of her child was an undercover officer, Bob Lambert, who was using the pseudonym Bob Robinson.
A third policeman, whose cover name was John Graham, reported on the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign in the late 1960s.
In his statement, he said: ""I regarded the people I was with as intellectuals.
""They were just people who believed that the Americans shouldn't be in Vietnam but had no idea how to get them out.""
The officer, who also gathered information on the Revolutionary Socialist Students Federation, grew a beard and was said to have been ""scruffier"" than his colleagues.","A policeman who used a dead child's identity to infiltrate a protest group in the 1970s was thrown out when his cover was blown, police documents show.",40828176

"NK News said the price spike was affecting petroleum and diesel fuel sales equally, and followed ""rumours China had been considering a halt of all crude oil sales to the DPRK"", as North Korea is formally known.
Crude oil is used for gasoline and petrol for cars and for diesel.
Foreigners in Pyongyang noticed motorists scrambling to fill up their tanks, as petrol stations started limiting what they would sell or even closing altogether.
At one petrol station, supplies were restricted to diplomats or vehicles used by international organisations, the Associated Press reported.
Queues were also much longer than usual and prices higher, it said.
The rise has prompted speculation - unverifiable - that China may be getting tough on its difficult neighbour, something other states have long been pressuring it to do.
Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump met in Florida earlier in the month, and have since talked on the phone.
Mr Trump has tweeted that China needs to do more to rein in Pyongyang. There is better US trade in it for China if it controls North Korea, according to the US president.
And China seems worried that there really is a risk of war on its doorstep, a war from which it could hardly isolate itself.
So China might be tightening the oil tap.
Alternatively, North Korean drivers - a small but growing number of privileged Pyongyang residents - might have feared that China was about to tighten the oil tap and decided to stock up, prompting a price surge.
Or the military might have requested more petrol. Or there might have been a simple glitch in supplies. We do not know.
But it does illustrate how much power China could exert over North Korea.
Figures are hard to come by because detailed data from North Korea and China on trade are not published. But it is clear that North Korea produces virtually none of its own oil and relies instead on China.
It produces abundant coal - even more abundant now since China cut down (perhaps to zero) its imports of coal from February.
Coal can fire power stations but it cannot make vehicles move. Therefore, the result of restricting oil to North Korea would eventually be a paralysis of the economy, certainly of the war economy.
According to most estimates, North Korea has about three months of oil in reserve.
In 2003, the oil pipe from China to North Korea shut a mere three days after a missile launch. China said it was a mechanical failure, but the suspicion outside was that it was China reminding North Korea where its oil comes from.
According to Stephen Haggard of the University of California: ""The objective is to send a credible signal that would make the North Korean leadership think twice.""
""It is all about shifting North Korea into a mode where negotiations would resume,"" he told Reuters.
Is North Korea thinking twice now as petrol prices rise in Pyongyang?
Not obviously. It seems to be sending irritated messages to Beijing.
A commentary on the state news site warned that a ""neighbouring country"" - widely read as China - ""will certainly face a catastrophe in their bilateral relationship as long as it continues to apply economic sanctions together with the United States"".
China might tighten the flow - but would it shut it off altogether and so halt the North Korean economy?
Would Mr Trump really punish China if it didn't?

"The biggest deficit is faced by the trust that runs Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, with a predicted shortfall of £47.9m in 2015-16.
In 2014-15 four of the 22 trusts in the East still had surpluses, but now only one - Luton and Dunstable - is predicted to break even.
The East's trusts had a £259m deficit in 2014-15, up from £159m in 2013-14.
John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund - which describes itself as an English health charity that shapes health and social care policy - said hospitals could not continue seeing year-on-year increases of 70%.
""It simply can't carry on. Trusts are in a pincer between higher demand (with more elderly people being treated, for example), higher costs and a squeezed income,"" he said.
""Quite what the implications for patients services are is difficult to say.""
Mr Appleby said he had spoken to NHS managers who said they could cut spending, but only by damaging patient care.
He said, nationally, a recent King's Fund survey of 83 trusts found that nine out of 10 hospitals were forecasting a deficit.
Mr Appleby said it was ""touch and go"" whether the Department of Health would be able to balance its books.
De Montfort University professor Rob Baggott, author of Health and Health Care in Britain, said the government could save huge amounts of money through health campaigns to cut obesity and smoking, but public health was now the responsibility of councils.
""The government is cutting the public health budget, which is madness,"" he said.
A Cambridge University Hospitals spokesman said: ""We are projecting a deficit but we are working hard to reduce this.
""We have a much better grip of our financial situation, for example we have completely cut out spend on expensive agency staff and invested in permanent staff.""

"NAB said it was looking at all options for the future of the Clydesdale and Yorkshire banking division.
The news came as the Melbourne-based bank announced a fall in profits, due mainly to problems at its UK operation.
Chief executive Andrew Thorburn said: ""We have an intention to exit the UK... What we are signalling is that's our intent, it is an absolute priority.""
Together, Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank have more than 320 branches. Earlier this year NAB announced a plan to close around 30 branches and invest £45m in its UK business.
Net profit at Australia's fourth largest bank was down 1.1% to A$5.3bn (£3bn), but cash earnings, which strip out volatile items, fell 9.8% to $5.18bn in the year to September.
Mr Thorburn told reporters: ""While our Australia and New Zealand franchises are in good shape, it is disappointing to record a full year result that includes $1.5bn after tax in UK conduct provisions and other impairments.
""Our clear focus is on our Australian and New Zealand franchises. In relation to exiting UK banking, this means we are now examining a broader range of options including those provided by public markets,"" said Mr Thorburn, who took over NAB in August.
He has already announced plans to offload the group's US operation Great Western Bank via a stock market listing.
NAB also announced profit figures for Clydesdale and Yorkshire. Annual pre-tax earnings rose by 90% to £203m, helped by a 49% drop in bad debts to £80m.
Last month the bank said that redress for Payment Protection Insurance mis-selling would cost £420m for the financial year just ended. That was up from £75m announced in August.
Clydesdale is also having to set aside £250m to repay businesses which were mis-sold complex financial products intended to protect against interest rate volatility.

"A deadly bee disease has spread worldwide through imports of infected honeybees, according to genetic evidence.
Stricter controls are needed to protect bees from other emerging diseases, researchers report in Science journal.
The virus together with the Varroa mite can kill-off whole hives, putting bee populations at risk.
Lead researcher Dr Lena Bayer-Wilfert of the University of Exeter said European bees are at the heart of the global spread of what she calls a ""double blow"" for colonies.
""This is clearly linked to the human movement of honeybee colonies around the globe,"" she told BBC News.
""It shows a piece of evidence we can't argue with.""
The pattern of the spread shows the movement of the virus around the world is manmade rather than natural, say scientists.
Co-researcher Prof Roger Butlin of the University of Sheffield said Deformed Wing Virus (DWV) was a major threat to honeybee populations across the world with the epidemic ""driven by the trade and movement of honeybee colonies"".
In the research, scientists at the University of Exeter, Sheffield and Salford tracked the emergence of DWV by analysing genetic samples from honeybees and Varroa mites in 32 locations of 17 countries.
They found that the epidemic largely spread from Europe to North America and countries such as New Zealand, with the European honeybee as the main transmitter.
Prof Stephen Martin of the University of Salford said the combination of the virus and the mite were at the heart of the crash in honeybee populations.
""It supports the idea that DWV is the main cause for the colony losses associated with Varroa and that this comes from European bees,"" he said.
Scientists believe the combination is particularly deadly because the parasite feeds on bee larvae, while also injecting the deadly virus into the body of grown bees.
The double threat is thought to have wiped out millions of honeybee colonies over recent decades.
The researchers are calling for tighter controls on importing honeybees, such as mandatory health screenings and more checks on movements across borders.
And they say every effort should be made to stop Varroa entering the few areas that are free of the mite to provide a refuge for conservation purposes.
Dr Bayer-Wilfert added: ""We must now maintain strict limits on the movement of bees, whether they are known to carry Varroa or not.""
Commenting on the study, Prof Mark Brown of Royal Holloway University of London said there were already trade controls in place for honeybees - such as checks by vets - but these were clearly not sufficient.
""We need better regulation if we want to stop this happening in the future for other viruses that are likely to emerge,"" he said.
The European honeybee is used worldwide for commercial pollination of crops such as nuts and fruit as well as for honey production.

"The poll for driving safety charity Brake found 49% of 17-24 year olds had been in work calls while on the road, compared with 17% for all age groups.
About 35% of young people said they had spoken to family, and 21% with friends - compared with 23% and 15% overall.
Brake asked about hand-held and hands-free calls. They are both a distraction ""risking devastating crashes"", it said.
""It is a sobering thought that a significant number of these life-threatening distractions come from drivers' own friends and family,"" said Julie Townsend from the charity.
The survey questioned 1,000 drivers from across the UK on whether they had spoken on the phone while driving, hand-held or hands-free, in the last 12 months. If so, they were asked who they were talking to.
Using a hand-held phone while driving was made illegal in 2003. Using a hands-free kit is allowed but a driver can still be stopped if police believe they are being distracted.
Brake says that making calls hands-free is still a cause of distraction and are campaigning for it be banned.
The charity is advising drivers to put their phones on silent while driving, with their phone away from them. The safest way to make a call is to stop, they say.
According to an observational study by the Department for Transport last October, motorists who use phones are more likely to be texting or using social media than making calls.
Brake has also warned about the dangers of being tired while driving, saying that it is wise to break for at least 15 minutes every two hours.
When asked how often they driven for more than two hours without a break in the last 12 months, 8% said weekly or more, 16% once a month and 29% once a year.","Young people are more likely to use their mobile phones while driving than older motorists, a survey suggests.",34074864

"The match-up was selected for prime time TV in the United States with an audience of 14 million hoping to see the number one overall draft pick make his debut. But quarterback Jared Goff didn't even suit up as a toothless Rams were beaten 28-0 in a game that sent me to sleep in the third quarter.
Now they stand at 3-1 for the season. In consecutive weeks, they have beaten Seattle Seahawks - many people's Super Bowl favourites - put 37 on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Tampa and seen off divisional rivals Arizona Cardinals too.
How? Well, Goff still hasn't played a snap in the NFL. Their second-year running back Todd Gurley, last season's offensive rookie of the year, is only averaging 2.6 yards per rushing attempt.
Yet head coach Jeff Fisher has got his defence back on track. They are 23rd in overall defence in the NFL but their turnover ratio is fourth in the league.
When your defence gives the offense shorter fields to work with, then points are easier to come by.
Just one more thing: the Rams have got to this stage with no permanent home after relocating from St Louis last season. Their new stadium will not be ready until 2019. They currently reside at the Memorial Coliseum (home of the 1984 Olympics) yet train 50 miles away in Thousand Oaks.
Training camp in the summer was 90 miles away and they will travel more than 37,000 miles through the air this year - in excess of 5,000 more than any other team. On the plus side, they will be accruing lots of frequent flyer miles. They head to England next week for the first NFL game at Twickenham.
So, if you're a fan of tight defensive games, tune in to BBC Radio 5 live sports extra as the Rams play host to the Buffalo Bills (2-2), who will be full of beans after shutting out the New England Patriots last week.
The Bills' colourful head coach, Rex Ryan, loves rubbing people up the wrong way but whether you love him or loathe him, he gets his teams ready to play and has one of the smartest defensive minds in the game.
1. Good luck Cleveland. You're having a horrible season at 0-4, and now you welcome the Patriots, who are angry they were shut out at home last week. And to rub salt into the wounds, four-time Super Bowl champion quarterback Tom Brady is back from his Deflate-gate suspension and will want to prove a point. Ouch.
2. Arguably the best defence in the league plays the best offense as the Atlanta Falcons travel to the Denver Broncos.
3. Dallas Cowboys rookie quarterback Dak Prescott has led his side to a 3-1 record and has yet to throw an interception in 131 attempts. Prescott has also shown excellent poise and decision-making qualities. As Tony Romo nears a return to fitness, can the youngster continue to impress this week at home to the dangerous Cincinnati Bengals and take the job permanently?
4. After every London match, the two sides take a bye week to get over the travel. For the first time that won't be the case as the Indianapolis Colts welcome the Chicago Bears to Lucas Oil stadium. The Colts are poor, even with top-rated quarterback Andrew Luck at the helm, and they may regret not taking the extra week off.
5. Oakland put a smile on my face against the Baltimore Ravens. But if they are to be taken seriously as a play-off contender, then a home victory against the San Diego Chargers is a must. The Chargers have thrown away winning situations at Kansas City and last week at home to the Saints, so have the talent to win. That's why the Raiders need to stay focused.

"A senior Foreign Office official is quoted in the message, sent in May 2009 and published by the Wikileaks website.
It suggested not formally agreeing an exception for ""specific missions"" until after the UK Parliament ratified the ban - thus avoiding debate among MPs.
The Foreign Office insists it never deliberately failed to inform MPs.
Dropped from the air or fired from the ground, cluster munitions release small bomblets over a wide area. Critics say they have a devastating humanitarian impact - most victims are civilians; a third are children.
Britain was among more than 90 countries which signed the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) in December 2008. The treaty bans the use of cluster bombs and prohibits signatories from assisting other countries to use, stockpile or transfer them.
The then prime minister, Gordon Brown, hailed the treaty as a ""major breakthrough"".
But the US - along with other major military powers such as Russia, China, India and Pakistan - was not a signatory. And that clearly put the UK in an awkward position with a key ally.
Nations sign cluster bomb treatyQ&A: Cluster bomb treaty
Britain leases the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia to the US, where the Americans have a major base in which cluster bombs are stored. Britain's public stance is that the US military has until 2013 to remove them.
In April this year, the then minister for international defence and security, Baroness Taylor of Bolton, assured Parliament: ""I can confirm that the US has identified its cluster munitions on UK territory as exceeding its worldwide operational planning requirements. Therefore, these cluster munitions will be removed from sites in the UK in 2010 and from all UK territories by 2013.""
But one of the cables released by the whistle-blowing website, Wikileaks, and reported by the Guardian shows the Foreign Office suggested a loophole to allow the US to keep cluster bombs on British soil should be kept from Parliament.
The cable reveals that the UK offered the Americans ""temporary storage exception for specific missions"". No details are given, but it is clear that this was something the government was keen to keep quiet.
The cable quotes a senior Foreign Office official as noting: ""It would be better for the USG [US government] and HMG [Her Majesty's Government] not to reach final agreement on this temporary agreement understanding until after the CCM ratification process is completed in Parliament, so that they can tell parliamentarians that they have requested the USG to remove its cluster munitions by 2013, without complicating/muddying the debate by having to indicate that this request is open to exceptions.""
The cable also reveals that most of the US cluster munitions are being stored on US vessels off Diego Garcia, apparently to circumvent the ban on the weapons remaining on British soil after 2013.
It states that the head of the Foreign Office's Security Policy Group, Nicolas Pickard, ""reconfirmed that off-shore storage on US ships would still be permitted"".
Responding to the leaked cable, Thomas Nash from the campaign group, Cluster Munition Coalition, told the BBC: ""The UK has banned cluster bombs entirely and is bound never to assist with use of cluster munitions by any country ever again. Along with 107 other countries, the UK condemned the use of cluster bombs in the final declaration of the first meeting of state parties to the cluster bomb ban in Lao PDR [People's Democratic Republic] last month.
""The cable also raises concern about respect for Parliament and for democratic practices on the part of the UK government. The so-called exceptions in the UK law should never be used and cluster bombs should never be anywhere near Diego Garcia again,"" he added.
""If any 'authorisations' are contemplated by the secretary of state, they should be subject to strict parliamentary scrutiny.""
A Foreign Office spokesman responded to the publication of the cable by saying: ""We reject any allegation that the FCO deliberately misled or failed in our obligation to inform Parliament.""","The UK kept quiet about a loophole allowing the US to continue storing banned cluster bombs on its territory, a leaked US diplomatic cable suggests.",11894759

Gatwick flights will continue from both islands with British Airways flying from Jersey and Aurigny flying from Guernsey.
Aurigny's Mark Darby said the airline is ready for the extra capacity.
""We've been doing a lot of work over the last few months. We're in good shape,"" the chief executive said.
""Being the sole operator is not particularly what we want to be, but as we will be the only operator of the Gatwick route it's essential for the States that we do a good job.""
Flybe was operating 34 flights per week to Gatwick from Guernsey and 28 flights a week from Jersey.
Aurigny has ordered a 122-seat Embraer 195 jet to increase the number of seats it can offer on each flight.
That plane is due to arrive in June and in the meantime the airline has hired an aircraft of the same type from Flybe.

Sexton, 31, has been out of action since sustaining his injury during Leinster's Champions Cup draw with Castres on 20 January.
Jackson deputised impressively for Sexton at Murrayfield and in Rome, but must settle for a place on the bench on this occasion.

""It's very hard to come into a side and come off the bench when you haven't played. So starting the match has allowed Johnny a bit more training time with the team this week.

"The Wales Life Sciences Fund was set up in 2012 to get more medical and pharmaceutical firms to move to Wales.
The Wales Audit Office (WAO) said ministers should have handled potential conflicts of interest ""more robustly"".
A spokeswoman for the Welsh government said: ""We will consider this report and respond in due course.""
It is understood the venture has created more than 150 highly-skilled jobs in Wales.
It was created on the recommendation of a panel chaired by multimillionaire life sciences entrepreneur Sir Chris Evans.
He later formed a company called Arthurian, which bid for and won the tender to manage the fund.
The fund also invested in ReNeuron, a firm in which Sir Chris held shares.
The WAO report, published on Thursday, found Arthurian and Sir Chris acted properly and potential conflicts of interest were declared.
But auditors made a series of criticisms of the Welsh government and its investment arm, Finance Wales.
It said:
Auditor general Huw Vaughan Thomas said: ""This report addresses a range of weaknesses in the Welsh government's and Finance Wales' establishment of the fund and in their oversight of its initial operations.
""These findings underline the continuing need for strong governance in this age of austerity.""
Public accounts committee chairman and Conservative AM Darren Millar said: ""Once again the auditor general for Wales has published a report which shows the governance and oversight arrangements put in place by Welsh government and Finance Wales to manage large sums of public money were insufficiently robust and have fallen short of what taxpayers should expect.""
Plaid Cymru's shadow economy minister Rhun ap Iorwerth said the fund was a ""strong idea"" which had been ""handled poorly"".
He said: ""There are clear failings in the way this fund has been set up and run.""

"Roger Smith, 46, was concerned about an attack similar to that on Fusilier Lee Rigby, Nottingham Crown Court was told.
Smith was found guilty in November of two counts of having explosive substances and of possessing a document for terrorist purposes.
The court heard Smith saw himself as a ""crusader against Muslims"".
The document charge related to a copy of the Anarchy Cookbook Version 2000, a guide to making bombs based on The Anarchist Cookbook.
Updates on this story and more from Nottinghamshire
Judge Gregory Dickinson QC told Smith: ""In your warped view of the world, you were preparing for the possibility of a local war with Islamic terrorists.
""In your own obsessive and misguided way, you were preparing for a fight that you believed to come.""
Police searched Smith's home in Clifton, Nottingham, on 21 October 2015 and found gunpowder and large amounts of chemicals that could be used to make explosives, along with a copy of the Anarchy Cookbook Version 2000.
Smith's trial heard he was concerned about ""a terrorist attack or Islamic attack similar to the Lee Rigby attack"".
PCSO Matthew Holden told jurors Smith believed a citizen should have the right to ""bear arms"", and said words to the effect that ""Islam was an evil religion and Islam was at war with the West"".
The prosecution told jurors there was no allegation Smith was a terrorist or that he was going to personally commit an act of terror.
In his police interview, Smith said he made the gunpowder to entertain his young relatives by lighting it in the garden.

"""We're not going to have panel shows on any more with no women on them,"" Danny Cohen told the Observer. ""You can't do that. It's not acceptable.""
His comments come two months after the BBC Trust was reported to have told executives there was ""no excuse"" for not having more female panellists.
Mr Cohen also said the BBC needed to get more older women on screen.
""We're getting better,"" he told the Observer, citing the example of historian Mary Beard. ""But we need to get better.""
In the past, comedy panel shows like QI, Mock the Week and Have I Got News For You have been criticised for their male-dominated line-ups.
The Observer said all the regular comedians on the most recent series of Mock the Week were men and only five of the 38 guest panellists were women.
A BBC spokesman said some panel shows that had been recorded but not yet been broadcast may feature all-male teams, but that all those filmed in the future would include at least one female participant.
""There may be very rare occasions where shows that were already recorded - or whose panels were already booked ahead of the order - still have all-male line-ups, but hopefully the change should really become apparent,"" the spokesman said.
The move follows criticism from Victoria Wood, who has criticised such ""testosterone-fuelled"" shows, and Jo Brand, who said she no longer considered appearing on Mock The Week.
In 2012, writer Caitlin Moran said she had been asked to appear on ""all the big panel shows"" but turned them down because ""I refuse to be the token woman"".
""I think that's a boys' game that works for boys,"" she said. ""It's not like they built it to screw women over, it's just that boys built it so they made it to work for boys.

"Edinburgh was the only Scottish institution to improve its standing in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings.
But Glasgow, Aberdeen, St Andrews and Dundee all saw their ratings drop dramatically.
The editor of the ratings warned UK universities were in danger of falling behind Asian rivals.
The California Institute of Technology retained the top spot in the survey - with Oxford University coming in second.
The UK was the second best represented country overall in the rankings, and three English universities were in the top ten.
But while the University of Edinburgh climbed from 36th to 32nd, Glasgow University fell 37 places to 139th, while Aberdeen dropped 25 places to joint 176th.
St Andrews went from 85th to 108th, and Dundee fell out of the top 200 altogether.
A spokesman for the University of Dundee said: ""While we are disappointed with the drop in our overall position in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, it is important to look at the context.
""Dundee actually recorded a slightly higher overall score than last year, according to the metrics used in the table. This includes higher scores for teaching, international outlook, and research.""
Education Secretary Mike Russell said: ""Scottish universities are well known around the world for the quality of education they offer.
""We have invested significant funding in our universities to ensure they can continue to offer a world-class degree and compete internationally.
""We will continue to deliver access to university based on the ability to learn, not the ability to pay, and this year more students will be studying at our world-class universities - unlike universities in England where, overall, the number of acceptances has fallen.""
However, Scottish Labour MSP Hugh Henry said: ""Despite generous settlements for universities paid for with money from Scotland's hard-pressed colleges, this clearly shows that Scottish universities are facing major challenges both within the UK and internationally.
""Many universities are privately concerned about how their funding will be sustained in the future.
""We need an open and honest debate about how Scotland's universities can compete internationally whilst properly funding Scotland's colleges.""
While the US and the UK still dominated the ratings, significant gains were made by their top Asian competitors.
The editor of the survey, Phil Baty, said uncertainty in education in England could see world-class universities collapse into global mediocrity.
He added that while Scotland was better protected by current policies, those were unlikely to be enough to meet the challenge posed by massive spending in Asia.
Mr Baty told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""We have to look at ways to ensure that in times of austerity we're getting money into our universities.
""I actually think the tuition fees that have been tripled in England aren't enough to cover the gaps in funding in other areas like research. Scotland's done well to protect higher education funding but it's not really enough.""
Alastair Sim, director at Universities Scotland, said having four Scottish universities in the world's top 200 was a ""recognition of the strength of Scotland's higher education sector"".
He said: ""It is clear that the value of a Scottish higher education stands up to international comparison.
""However, Scotland's universities are competing in a brutally competitive global marketplace. It will take the continued commitment of energy, initiative and investment if we want to compete with the increasingly powerful top Asia-Pacific universities and the best of Europe and America.
""We are ambitious for a Scottish higher education sector truly excellent in world terms, not just truly excellent when compared to the rest of the UK.""

Francisco Macias Nguema's reign of terror - from independence in 1968 until his overthrow in 1979 - prompted a third of the population to flee. Apart from allegedly committing genocide against the Bubi ethnic minority, he ordered the death of thousands of suspected opponents, closed down churches and presided over the economy's collapse.
His successor - Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo - took over in a coup and has shown little tolerance for opposition during the three decades of his rule. While the country is nominally a multiparty democracy, elections have generally been considered a sham.
According to Human Rights Watch, the ''dictatorship under President Obiang has used an oil boom to entrench and enrich itself further at the expense of the country's people''.
The corruption watchdog Transparency International has put Equatorial Guinea in the top 12 of its list of most corrupt states. In 2008 the country became a candidate of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative - an international project meant to promote openness about government oil revenues - but failed to qualify by an April 2010 deadline. It has since re-applied.
A 2004 US Senate investigation into the Washington-based Riggs Bank found that President Obiang's family had received huge payments from US oil companies such as Exxon Mobil and Amerada Hess.
Observers say the US finds it hard to criticise a country which is seen as an ally in a volatile, oil-rich region. In 2006, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice hailed President Obiang as a ""good friend"" despite repeated criticism of his human rights and civil liberties record by her own department. More recently President Barack Obama posed for an official photograph with President Obiang at a New York reception.
In October 2014, President Obiang's son Teodorin, a government minister, was forced to relinquish more than 30 million dollars of assets in the United States, which the authorities there say were bought with stolen money.

It has been reported that the firm linked to Mr Ashley paid around Â£25m after seeing off competition from private equity firm Lion Capital.
The lingerie firm was sold via a so called ""pre-pack deal"" - that means a buyer is lined up to buy the assets of a company, but crucially not its liabilities, such as its debt and pension deficit.
It is usually agreed before the company is publicly declared to be in financial difficulty. Defenders of such deals argue that they allow a company to survive and protect jobs.

"A team of 12 scientists and engineers has begun work at remote Lake Ellsworth.
They are using a high-pressure hose and sterilised water at near boiling point to  blast a passage through more than two miles of ice.
The aim is to analyse ice waters isolated for up to 500,000 years.
The process of opening a bore-hole is expected to last five days and will be followed by a rapid sampling operation before the ice refreezes.
Lake Ellsworth is one of several hundred lakes known to exist beneath the ice-sheet - its waters kept just above freezing temperature by the warmth of the rocks below.
It is thought that the lake has been cut off from the outside world for long enough to raise the possibility that microbial life has evolved in unique ways.
This will be the first attempt to use highly sterilised equipment to collect samples of water and sediment from a body of water so deep and isolated for so long.
The aim of the project is to investigate the limits of where life is possible so preventing any contamination has been integral to the design of the equipment.
Chief scientist Prof Martin Siegert told the BBC that ""everything has to be done in ultra clean conditions.""
""We don't want to contaminate this pristine environment - and unless we keep the experiment very clean, we're likely just to measure the things that we bring down us with, which would be pointless.""
The engineer in charge of the hot water drilling, Andy Tait, described the operation as ""huge but delicate"".
""Although hot-water drilling technology has been used extensively by scientists in the past, this is the first time we've ever attempted to go through 3km of solid ice - this will be the deepest borehole ever made this way.
""We've fired up the boilers to heat the water to 90Â°C.  The water pressure coming out of the hose will be around 2,000 PSI - 15 to 20 times more powerful than the kind you wash your car with.
""It is the most effective way to obtain rapid, clean access to Lake Ellsworth.""
The next two days will be spent drilling out a 'chamber' the size of a caravan below the surface of the ice-sheet so that a reservoir of sterilised water is ready to prevent any lake water rising up into the borehole.
Prof Siegert said that exploring for life in such an extreme environment - in pitch-black conditions under high pressure beneath the ice-sheet - could open up possibilities for life on other worlds such as Jupiter's moon Europa.
""The experiment we're doing is very similar to an experiment one might do to see whether there is life on Europa.
""We know Europa has an icy crust and an ocean beneath it.
""If there's life on Europa it'll be living in a very similar way to life in Lake Ellsworth with total darkness, lots of pressure and using chemical processes rather than sunlight to power biological processes.""

"John Bainbridge, now 54, raped a mother at knifepoint in front of her two children in Nottingham in May 1986.
He then murdered a woman in similar circumstances in October 1986, and was jailed for this.
Police always suspected the two crimes were linked but had not been able to prove it until recently.
Semen samples taken as evidence in 1986 were tested using DNA-17 profiling, a more sensitive test that has only been used by police since 2014.
Bainbridge had been released from prison and was living in Burton-on-Trent in Staffordshire when police arrested him in June 2016.
Bainbridge initially denied rape and had been due to stand trial, but he changed his plea on Friday at Nottingham Crown Court.
The judge told him he will serve a minimum of eight years before being considered for release.
Bainbridge planned both of his attacks and targeted the women after their husbands had left their homes.
He raped his first victim, who was then aged 34, in Vernon Road, in the Basford area of Nottingham, on 15 May 1986.
He was armed with a knife, which he used to threaten her and also cut open her underwear.
One of her children was already in the room, but Bainbridge made her call the other child in, meaning both children witnessed their mother being attacked.
He also threatened to kill one of the children, who was upset, shouting at the other to ""shut up or I'll kill him.""
Adrian Langdale, prosecuting, said: ""She went on to describe to police how she tried not to struggle or fight for fear of her own safety and that of her children.
""It may well be that that particular action by her saved not only her life, but her children as well.""
Five months later Bainbridge murdered his second victim - 43-year-old Rosemary Scott - by stabbing her in the chest at Simkins Farm in Adbolton Lane, West Bridgford, on 16 October.
He cut open her underwear with the knife, mirroring the way he had attacked the other woman.
Police believe the attack was sexually motivated, and he stabbed Mrs Scott while she struggled to defend herself.
He was given a life sentence for this in 1987, and originally served 20 years before being released.
However, he was sent back to prison twice for breaching his licence conditions, meaning he has already served 26 years and 10 months in prison.
Det Insp Justine Wilson praised the rape victim and her children, who were all prepared to give evidence if the trial had gone ahead.
""I absolutely give the best praise for the courage that both the victim and her two children have had to come forward,"" she said.
""One of her reasons behind it was she didn't want this man out on the street, she wanted him locked up so she could never, ever, do this again to anybody else.""
Lawrence English, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said the case shows how valuable it is to preserve all evidence in a case.
""There is no doubt that this conviction was made possible by the decisions by the police all the way back in 1986 to keep and preserve the samples, despite not knowing how DNA technology would develop,"" he said.
""Advances in technology now mean that we can match DNA to a suspect, regardless of how long ago the samples were taken.""",A convicted murderer has been given a second life sentence for a rape he committed 30 years ago - thanks to advances in DNA testing.,38269711
"Zero-hours contracts do not guarantee a minimum number of hours of employment.
The ONS recently estimated that 583,000 people, around 2% of the UK workforce, were employed on zero-hours contracts between October and December 2013.
It said the data suggested that most workers on such contracts had at least two jobs.
What are zero-hours contracts?
Last year, Business Secretary Vince Cable ruled out a complete ban on the contracts, because they offer employers ""welcome flexibility"".
Following the release of the ONS figures Mr Cable said it was also clear there had been some abuse of those on zero hour contracts by some less scrupulous employers.
""Given the current estimates of people on these types of contracts, it is important we take action. That is why I launched a consultation on the issue of exclusivity in zero hours to ensure people are getting a fair deal,"" he said.
""Students, older people and people wanting to top up their income want to work flexibly, but we want to make sure they understand their rights and that they are not tied exclusively to one employer.
""We will be publishing the results of this consultation shortly.""
Last week, Labour leader Ed Miliband said zero hours contracts had ""spread like an epidemic"" as he promised to crack down on them if his party wins the 2015 general election.
The study found that more than 20% of health and social workers are employed on a zero-hours contacts.
But zero-hours contracts are rare in financial services, the ONS found.
People with zero-hours contracts were disproportionately students, female and under 25 or over 65, the study also found.
""These patterns may partly reflect the groups most likely to find the flexibility of 'zero-hours contracts' an advantage,"" the ONS said.
The Trades Union Congress (TUC) said the figures showed the UK jobs market was far more unstable than the government suggested, and urged ministers to crack down on the ""abuse"" of zero-hours contracts by employers.
""Insecure work with no guarantee of regular paid hours is no longer confined to the fringes of the jobs market,"" said Frances O'Grady, the TUC's general secretary.
""It is worrying that so many young people are trapped on zero-hours contracts, which can hold back their careers and make it harder to pay off debts like student loans.
""The fact that these contracts have become the norm in tourism, catering and food will be a major concern for the millions of people employed in these industries.""
ONS said it found evidence of a further 1.3 million contracts where no work was undertaken.
It said the total might include:
It added some of contracts ""probably"" needed to be added to the official 1.4 million estimate, but that it wanted to investigate in more detail.
The ONS said it would carry out further research and report later in 2014.
The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, Britain's main human resources body, estimated last year that employers used about one million zero-hours contracts.","Nearly half of big companies in the UK use a total of 1.4 million zero-hours contracts, a study from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) says.",27219654
"Personal trainer Dave Sims, 36, from Southport, Merseyside, adapted the classic children's bike to complete the gruelling challenge.
He received a message of support from the Tour winner, Chris Froome, who said he was ""pretty impressed"".
The 1,600-mile (2,575km) circuit is the stage for one of the most gruelling events in the sporting calendar.
Mr Sims said it was a tough challenge and some modifications were required.
""If you've ever ridden any serious miles on a Chopper, which most people haven't, the seat was that wide that it caused serious chafing issues.
""I value my femur bone, so the seat post and the seat had to change. I've also got quite long legs and it is at the end of the day a children's bike, so I need a much longer seat post.""

"The McKinsey Global Institute conducted the research showing more female employment would boost the economy.
It found $2.1 trillion could be added if the country raised its female employment ratio from 64% to 74%.
""Gender inequality is a pressing human issue, but also has huge ramifications for jobs, productivity, GDP growth, and inequality,"" the report said.
The report says 6.4 million new jobs would need to be added to the US, on top of the 10 million already projected to be added by 2025, just to reach the $2.1 trillion target. That would require businesses and local governments to invest $475 billion.
The US economy has added more than two million jobs for the last three years, but most have been low paying.
Opponents of government enforced equality programs often point to the high cost new regulations place on businesses.
To get the full economic benefit women would also have to occupy more high paid and full-time jobs. Women make up 46% of the US workforce, but currently contribute just one fifth of the country's annual gross domestic product (GDP).
Promoting more women to leadership and management roles and training them for higher skilled positions would boost their contribution to the economy, the study said.
Reducing the amount of time women spend on unpaid work is also essential.  Between 1965 and 2010 labour force participation rate for women rose, but the time women spent on unpaid child care also climbed by a third.
In February, philanthropist Melinda Gates, addressing the impact of unpaid work called it a ""hidden cost in society.""
On Tuesday, San Francisco became the first US city to pass a law mandating fully paid parental leave.
The study's authors called for government action to address to paid parental leave, which is not guaranteed in the US, and improve childcare. They also said businesses should look at their hiring and performance evaluation practices to boost gender diversity.
The authors admitted that reaching the $4.2 trillion figures was unlikely because the ""barriers hindering women from fully participating in the labour market make it unlikely that they will attain full gender equality within a decade.""
In September, a research report by MGI said $12 trillion would be added to the global economy if gender equality was reached worldwide.","Gender equality in the workplace could add $4.3 trillion (£3 trillion) to the US economy by 2025, a study has found.",35991852

"Nine-month-old Millie Thompson, of Stockport, fatally choked on her lunch at Ramillies Hall School and Nursery in Cheadle Hulme, in October 2012.
A review was conducted after an e-petition was set up by Millie's mother Joanne.
She said she was ""so proud"" the change would be her ""daughter's legacy"".
Childcare and education minister Sam Gyimah announced the proposals.
He said: ""Today's proposals will mean that thousands more staff will be able to respond to emergencies more quickly, making sure parents really can access the very best possible childcare choices for their families.""
Mrs Thompson told BBC Radio Manchester she cried when she heard the news.

Cheadle MP Mark Hunter (Liberal Democrat), who held a Westminster Hall debate in parliament, said he was delighted with this ""massive step in the right direction"".
He said: ""Out of the tragedy of losing Millie, [her parents] have exposed a loophole in the regulations that not all relevant nursery staff had to have a qualification in paediatric first aid.""

"New maps show ""alarming losses"" of pristine landscapes, particularly in South America and Africa, according to World Conservation Society scientists.
They argue in Current Biology that wild areas are ignored in international conservation agreements, despite their ecological and cultural value.
About 20% of the world's land area is classed as wilderness.
By this, scientists mean landscapes free of large-scale human disturbances such as housing, development and industry.
The majority of these untouched spaces are found in North America, north Asia, north Africa and Australia.
They are often home to indigenous peoples as well as endangered plants and animals.
'Invest more' in protected areas
'Rewilding' Australia's landscape
James Watson of the University of Queensland, Australia, and the US Wildlife Conservation Society in New York said wilderness areas ""are completely ignored in environmental policy"".
""International policy mechanisms must recognise the actions needed to maintain wilderness areas before it is too late,"" said Prof Watson.
""We probably have one to two decades to turn this around.""
The findings are based on a current map of wilderness areas around the globe compared with one produced in the same way in the early 1990s.
The maps show that an estimated 3.3 million sq km (almost 10%) of wilderness area has been lost in that time.
The researchers say all wilderness areas, regardless of their size, should be assessed immediately for protection measures.
If not, all attempts to restore places to nature - known as ""rewilding"" - will be futile, they argue.
Toos van Noordwijk, director of engagement and science at Earthwatch Institute (Europe), said the research highlighted a very troubling trend that affects us all.
""In Europe, we lost most of our wilderness long before 1990,"" she said.
""But even here, biodiversity is still declining, as will be demonstrated again by the State of Nature report that will be released next Wednesday.""
She said we all shared responsibility for the main cause of this loss around the world - unsustainable land use, particularly for agriculture.
But she said the good news was that there were more opportunities for action than ever before, including the growing field of citizen science.
""We urgently need to embrace these opportunities to preserve wilderness areas and a rich biodiversity,"" she added.

District judge Emma Arbuthnot at Westminster Magistrates' Court said there was a real risk they would not get a fair trial in Rwanda.
The Crown Prosecution Service indicated it would appeal against the ruling.
Vincent Brown, also known as Vincent Bajinya, Charles Munyaneza, Emmanuel Nteziryayo, Celestin Ugirashebuja and Celestin Mutabaruka were accused of playing an active part in the killings.
An estimated 800,000 Rwandans, mostly Tutsis but including some moderate Hutus, died between April and May 1994.
An attempt to extradite four of the men, who are all of Hutu ethnicity, was thrown out by the High Court in 2009 on similar grounds.

"Ronald MacNeil, 55, from Leven in Fife, admitted failing to ensure there was a second diver on standby to help when Graeme Mackie entered the water.
Mr Mackie, 31, resurfaced in distress shouting for help just a minute into his first dive in the Firth of Forth.
MacNeil was sentenced to 300 hours of community service over the incident, which happened on 11 June 2011.
During the trial, Dunfermline Sheriff Court heard that the ""Rob Roy"" boat had been involved in electro-fishing, a practice where a generator on the ship sends charges to electrodes trailed on the seabed, shocking shellfish to rise to the surface of the sandy bottom, where they can be collected.
However, the depute fiscal said there was no evidence this was a factor in Mr Mackie's death, which was caused by drowning.
In order to know when to start the electrodes for electro-fishing, it was decided that Mr Mackie would remove his mouth piece and the surfacing of the bubbles would indicate he was ready to start fishing.
The court heard that after entering the water off the Fife coast, Mr Mackie re-surfaced about ""10 to 15 seconds later in distress"".
The father-of-one from Tranent, East Lothian, then sank unconscious to the river bed.
MacNeil jumped in to the sea, 600 metres off Methil Harbour, in a bid to rescue him.
Mr Mackie was eventually recovered and airlifted to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, where he was pronounced dead.
A dive computer calculated that from the time Mr Mackie had entered the water to the time he was discovered, was 24 minutes.
When sentencing, Sheriff Craig McSherry said it had been a ""tragic incident"", though MacNeil had previously had a good safety record.
He ordered him to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work and placed him on a home curfew between the hours of 19:00 and 07:00 for six months.
Sheriff McSherry said: ""I understand that you were diving earlier before the incident took place, so if you yourself had been on standby it is possible that Mr Mackie's death might have been avoided.
""I don't believe that the breach of the regulations by you was for profit - there is no evidence that you were cutting corners.""
MacNeil had been due to face trial accused of being responsible for a series of health and safety failings that led to the tragedy.
However, Louise Beattie, prosecuting, accepted a plea to a single failing, not having a standby diver, known as a frogman, who could have gone to Mr Mackie's aid in an emergency, in consequence of which Mr Mackie drowned.
She said it was ""a serious breach"".
Ms Beattie, who specialises in health and safety prosecution, said MacNeil had checked Mr Mackie's diving equipment and was satisfied everything was fine before allowing him into the water.
During the trial, the court heard that Mr Mackie's ambition was to eventually become an underwater welder.
He had undertaken ""an intensive underwater dive course"" and advertised himself as a trainee shellfish diver online, prompting MacNeil, a fisherman with many years' experience, to get in touch.

The government last published figures for inflation in December 2015, putting it at 180%, but the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that next year's prices will rise by more than 2,000%.

"Data presented at the National Cancer Research Institute conference showed poverty was linked to 450 breast cancer deaths a year.
Catching the tumour late is thought to be a major explanation for the deaths.
The Department of Health said ""much more"" could be done to diagnose and treat cancer earlier.
Cancer charities and the researchers urged women to see their GP promptly.
Scientists from Cambridge and Leicester universities used data from 20,738 patients in the east of England who had breast cancer diagnosed between 2006 and 2010.
They looked at what stage of the cancer the tumours were being diagnosed. The later the diagnosis, the more advanced the tumour and the harder it is to treat.
Women from the most affluent areas were catching their tumours earlier, the data showed.
The study found that if women from more socially deprived backgrounds could match the level of diagnosis among the more affluent, 450 lives could be saved each year in England.
One of the researchers, Dr Gary Abel, of the University of Cambridge, told the BBC it was not entirely clear why poverty affected women's chances of survival.
""But we think it's to do with both symptom awareness amongst the more deprived women and also what action they take once they find that there is something wrong - and how quickly they go to their GP,"" he said.
""What we seem to see is that women from more affluent areas will go straight to their GP, seek help immediately. Whereas women from more deprived areas maybe tend to hold back before going.
He called for a ""renewed effort"" to boost awareness campaigns, pointing out that around 70% of those with breast cancer were diagnosed by their GP - not through the national screening programme.
""Clearly this research shows that there is still work to be done and perhaps we need to move beyond just telling people what the symptoms are and encouraging people to go and see their GP as quickly as possible.""
Dr Julie Sharp, of Cancer Research UK, said: ""Other research shows that women from deprived backgrounds are more likely to feel embarrassed or worried about going to their GP, but it's important for women to take that step as going to the GP promptly could make all the difference.""
""All women should be aware of how their breasts normally look and feel because we know that early diagnosis is one of the most important factors in whether breast cancer treatment is effective.""
Eluned Hughes, head of public health at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, added: ""By focusing on improving early diagnosis, particularly in deprived areas, we can have most impact in stopping women dying from breast cancer.
A Department of Health spokesman said much more could be done to diagnose and treat cancer earlier.
""We are spending Â£450 million to help diagnose cancer earlier, which will save thousands of extra lives every year, and we are investing more than Â£170 million over four years to expand and introduce pioneering new methods of screening for cancer.
""We are also committed to reducing inequalities in cancer care - that's why our Be clear on cancer campaigns are aimed at more disadvantaged groups and try to build awareness of cancer symptoms.""
Previous research by Public Health England has shown a strong link between poverty and health. Cancer, heart attacks, strokes, lung disease and liver disease are all more likely in areas of social deprivation.","Hundreds of women from the poorest backgrounds in England are dying needlessly of breast cancer, according to researchers.",24777347
"Frenchman Nacer Bouhanni of Cofidis won the 134 km stage from Llivia to Igualada with a sprint finish.

Thomas's team-mate Froome is a further five seconds back in fifth place.
Van Garderen leads Spanish team-mate Samuel Sanchez by 41 seconds in the general classification.
Friday's fifth stage of seven is expected to decide the race as it culminates with a gruelling 8.4km climb to Lo Port.
Stage four was shortened by 60 kilometres because of snow at the start.
Tour de France champion Froome made a break on the descent from the final climb along with Movistar's Alejandro Valverde and Marco Soler, and David Gaudu of FDJ, but they were caught by the peloton with five kilometres left.
""We knew it would probably be a bunch sprint with a reduced group, but with the shortened stage it was super fast all day,"" said Welshman Thomas.
""It's a big, big day tomorrow so we'll rest up now, fuel up, and see what we've got.""
There were signs of lingering discontent following the decision by officials earlier in the week to penalise Movistar, as their rider Jose Joaquin Rojas drew attention to the behaviour of Van Garderen.
Rojas was penalised three minutes, and his team-mates 60 seconds each, for pushing during Tuesday's team time-trial which cost the Spaniard the lead.

"The street outside the High Court was barricaded off to allow the drugs to be transported by police.
The haul was found on MV Hamal, a tug suspected of being used for international drug smuggling.
UK Border Force officers, with Royal Navy support, boarded the tug in an operation about 100 miles east of Aberdeen in April last year.
Border Force Force officer Lee Butler told the court that he and other members of a specialist ""deep rummage"" team searched the tug after it was taken to  Aberdeen Harbour.
The court was told the 129 bales of drugs were found behind a welded plate in a forward ballast tank and in an area accessed by a hatch in a cabin.
In a highly unusual move, cocaine was brought under tight security to the High Court for the jury to view.
Inside the court building, a secure area was set up in the corridor to allow jurors to view the drugs and their labels.
The stacked bales of cocaine covered an area measuring 12ft by 10ft (3.6m by 3m) and 4ft (1.2m) high.
Each bale was individually sealed in plastic evidence bags. They were later taken back to a secret location.
Earlier Martin Pownall of the Border Force described how the tug was boarded at sea.
He said the boarding crew met no resistance from the crew of MV Hamal.

Rivers burst their banks in downtown Houston and 1,200 people were rescued from rising floodwaters.
Close to 70,000 people were left without power in the city, the fourth-largest in the United States.
At least 1,000 homes have flooded, with the number likely to rise. City officials have turned a large shopping centre into an evacuation centre.
As well as telling people not to drive in the fast-flowing waters, city officials warned against allowing children to play in waters that are likely to contain snakes and ants.
Among the worst-hit areas is Greenspoint, a poor, mainly Hispanic district of more than 112,000 people to the north of the city centre.
Footage broadcast in Texas showed Greenspoint families moving belongings and children through floodwaters on air beds and inside a refrigerator.
""Do not think the city is not seeing you,"" Mayor Sylvester Turner told Greenspoint residents in a press conference.

"Celtic Energy is closing Nant Helen, Coelbren, because Wales' biggest coal-fired power station, Aberthaw, is downgrading its operations from April.
A consultation on the closure was held with unions in June and July who called the decision ""sad but not unexpected"".
Nant Helen is Celtic Energy's largest operational site and has about three million tonnes of coal in reserve.
Of the 91 employees at the site there will be 31 voluntary and 44 compulsory redundancies, while a small team will stay on to carry out security and maintenance operations.
Mike Macdonald, negotiations officer with Prospect union, which represents around dozen engineers at the site, said the decision was ""not the employer's fault"".
He added: ""The site had been run down with the intention of restoring it in the future - and now it is going to be shut down before any finance has been raised.
""It all stems from UK government policy towards coal-fired energy generation [wanting all coal-fired power stations to close by 2025].
""The optimistic view is that we get clarity on the future of the industry at the end of this autumn.
""But we fear that it is inevitable that the skills will decline as people find other work - and we won't have the skills needed to keep the mines working.
""When jobs do reappear, they tend to reappear outside the area, and alternative employment is very slow at coming in.""
Will Watson, chief executive of Celtic Energy, said the company ""is confident the site will recommence coaling operations in approximately two years"".

"David Fawcett, a government senator, made the comment during a parliamentary hearing on Monday.
In a debate about asylum seeker boat arrivals, Mr Fawcett accused the opposition Labor Party of ""[bringing] the fleas in the first place"".
He later apologised for his ""poor choice of words"", claiming they were not directed at asylum seekers.
""I have just been on the phone to Mr Phil Glendenning, the president of Refugee Council of Australia,"" Mr Fawcett told a late senate session.
""He has outlined how the words I spoke earlier today have been taken, and the deep hurt that this has caused across the network of communities that his council represents... consequently I sincerely apologise.""
Australia has a tough and controversial policy of holding asylum seekers who arrive by boat in offshore detention centres on the Pacific nations of Nauru and Papua New Guinea.
Mr Fawcett made the remark as he criticised Labor for highlighting cost blowouts in the Department of Immigration and Border Control.
""I just do question the ethics of nitpicking when your particular group perhaps brought the fleas in the first place,"" he said.
The comment was met with a ""hear hear"" by one person present, while fellow government Senator Ian MacDonald said ""nicely put"".
Mr Fawcett later claimed he had been misconstrued. He said the comment was meant as a figure of speech to criticise Labor MPs for ""pursuing very small"" details on asylum seeker policies ""during a period of great activity and stress"" for the department.
Labor immigration spokesman Shayne Neumann said it was ""beyond belief"" that a ""government senator would ever refer to vulnerable people seeking asylum as fleas, and even worse, to have other coalition senators laugh, cheer and eagerly agree"".
Australia's offshore detention policy is supported by the government and Labor. It is intended as a deterrent, but critics say it harms asylum seekers.

In the fighting between the army and former rebels, a local journalist was killed and aid workers were raped.

In its statement, Kenya said Mr Ban's decision to sack Gen Ondieki failed to address the root causes of the problem highlighted in the report.

But Mr Ruane says practising the meditation technique known as mindfulness helped him cope.
He has just returned from a visit to Canberra where he shared the benefits of mindfulness with Australian MPs.
Mental health charity Sane Australia asked Mr Ruane to go to Parliament House.
Mr Ruane told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme the mindfulness techniques he has been practising for eight years were put to a very personal test when he lost his seat.
He said: ""I was an MP for 18 years. I wasn't expected to lose. Labour wasn't expected to lose. When I saw the results come up, I accepted it and that's part of the mental skills you learn in mindfulness.
""It's about acceptance. It's about gratitude. It's about being in the present moment. So I was able to draw on those reserves and make what I think was quite a decent rejection speech and to come to terms with it after that. I mean life goes on.""
He said his visit to Canberra was to benefit both the MPs personally and to spread the mindfulness message to influence policy areas such as health and education.
Mr Ruane said there had been a positive reception, adding: ""This isn't fluffy stuff. The US Marines have been using this pre-combat since 2009 and I would put those as some of the toughest people on earth.""

""I had some really close moments where I thought 'this might be it',"" he said.
More on the Napoli grounding, and other news
The 62,000-tonne vessel had been badly damaged in a storm in the English channel on 18 January 2007 and started taking in water through a hole in its side.
Petty Officer O'Donnell was winched from an RNAS Culdrose based Royal Navy Search and Rescue helicopter into the sea to rescue the crew.
He then swam through a 40ft swell to the ship's lifeboat where the crew had gathered and proceeded to attach all 26 to the winch line one at a time.
Mr O'Donnell recalled: ""The lifeboat they were in had very little control and was rolling all over the place. And the more people we got off, the lighter it was and the more unstable it became.
""We were absolutely fuel critical - the helicopter crew was signalling how many minutes we had left.
""When we got back we were literally on fumes. But I knew they'd come back for me if they had to.
""That day was the most dramatic I've ever seen the sea,"" he said.
He was awarded the Queen's gallantry medal for his part in the rescue.
The huge ship ran aground in the following days.
Up to 200 tonnes of oil leaked from the vessel, which had to be broken up with explosives.
Motorbikes, pet food, wine barrels and anti-wrinkle cream were among the varied items that washed up on Branscombe beach in Devon.

He was unhurt but the crash ended Ferrari's running for the day.
Bottas set the pace with a lap of one minute 19.310 seconds, 0.11secs quicker than Williams' Felipe Massa.
Three-time champion Lewis Hamilton set the sixth-fastest time for Mercedes.
It was another difficult day for McLaren, who have been beset by reliability and performance problems with their Honda engine so far in pre-season.
The team insisted they suffered no specific problems but two-time champion Fernando Alonso managed only 46 laps - compared with a total of 149 for the two Mercedes drivers.
The Spaniard, who was 12th fastest, was 2.6secs slower than the fastest driver [Raikkonen] who also used the 'soft' tyre to set his quickest time.
In a far less extreme fashion, it was also a frustrating day for Red Bull. Although Max Verstappen completed more laps than any other individual driver, the team had to complete a change of a Renault engine and the Dutchman also ground to a stop out on track a few laps from the end of a race-simulation run.
Bottas was using the super-soft tyre and Massa the ultra-soft when they set their fastest times.
Headline lap times in pre-season are notoriously inaccurate predictions for true competitive form.
Although Bottas was 0.9secs quicker than Raikkonen on the day, the margin between the soft and super-soft tyres is said to be about 0.6-0.7secs. On that basis alone, Bottas' lap was of comparable pace to the fastest soft-tyre lap of last week's first test, set by Raikkonen's team-mate Sebastian Vettel and the German's lap on the first day of this week's test on Tuesday.
There are countless other variables to take into account, such as fuel load, engine mode, car settings and so on, all of which can have a significant effect on lap time.

"Verizon's purchase of Yahoo's core internet arm was put in doubt last year after disclosure of two cyber attacks.
Several reports in the US said Yahoo has now accepted a price cut of up to $350m and agreed to share liability with Verizon for potential lawsuits.
News of the renegotiated terms was first reported by Bloomberg, which said an announcement could come this week.
Verizon wants to combine Yahoo's search, email and messenger assets, as well as advertising technology tools, with its AOL unit. Verizon bought AOL in 2015 for $4.4bn.
Verizon sees mobile video and advertising as new sources of revenue outside an overcrowded US telecoms market.
One of the original early internet search providers, Yahoo admitted in December 2016 it had been hit by a large cyber attack in 2013 which affected more than a billion customer accounts.
Yahoo had already admitted another breach in 2014 that had affected around half a billion users.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission has launched an investigation into whether Yahoo should have disclosed the breaches sooner, according to a report last month in the Wall Street Journal.
On Wednesday, Yahoo sent a warning to users whose accounts may have potentially been accessed by hackers between 2015 and 2016, as part of a data security issue related to the breach it disclosed in December. Yahoo did not say how many users may have been affected.
Since the hacking revelations last year, Yahoo has focused on trying to restore confidence in its key search business.

The capital Bogota was mentioned on the flight plan as a possible refuelling stop, but the plane did not land there.
The plane plunged into a mountainside near Medellin late on Monday.
Only six of the 77 people on board the plane survived.
""Having been able to do an inspection of all of the remains and parts of the plane, we can affirm clearly that the aircraft did not have fuel at the moment of impact,"" civil aviation chief Alfredo Bocanegra told a news conference.
Freddy Bonilla, another aviation official, said regulations stipulated that aircraft must have 30 minutes of fuel in reserve to reach an alternative airport in an emergency, but ""in this case the plane did not have"" it.
""The engines are the electrical source... but without fuel, obviously the electrical source would have been completely lost,"" he added.
In a leaked tape, the pilot can be heard warning of a ""total electric failure"" and ""lack of fuel"". Just before the tape ends, he says he is flying at an altitude of 9,000ft (2,745m).
The plane was carrying the Brazilian football team Chapecoense, who had been due to play a cup final against Atletico Nacional in Medellin on Wednesday evening.
The team flew from Sao Paulo to Santa Cruz on a commercial flight, then switched to the chartered aircraft.
Brazil's O Globo reported that because of a delayed departure, a refuelling stop in Cobija - on the border between Brazil and Bolivia - was abandoned because the airport did not operate at night.
The pilot had the option to refuel in Bogota, but headed straight to Medellin.
""The pilot was the one who took the decision,"" Gustavo Vargas, a representative of Lamia, which operated the plane, was quoted as saying in Bolivian newspaper Pagina Siete. ""He thought the fuel would last.""
Approaching Medellin, the pilot asked for permission to land because of fuel problems, without making a formal distress call.
But another plane from airline VivaColombia had priority because it had already suffered a fuel leak, the co-pilot of another plane in the air at the time said.
The pilot of the crashed plane is heard asking urgently for directions to the airport before the audio recording ends.
Officials say the plane's ""black boxes"", which record flight details, will be sent to the UK to be opened by investigators. A full investigation into the crash is expected to take months.
There are some critical questions investigators need to answer.
If the plane did indeed run out of fuel, why didn't the crew fill up en route, as was reportedly planned?
And why wasn't it carrying the required 30-minute fuel reserve? Or maybe it was, and there was a fuel leak somewhere.
Also, why was the aircraft told to circle while another flight with a problem was given priority to land? Did the crew make it clear to the ground that they had a crisis on their hands?
Looking at the radar track, it appears to circle for around 13 minutes. Yet it was only around three or four minutes flying time from the airport.
Accidents normally come down to a series of problems and decisions that add up to catastrophe. There are often moments, with hindsight, where a tragedy could have been averted.
We still don't have an official explanation yet. So, there may be facts or problems yet to come out that put a totally different complexion on what happened.
On Wednesday night, when the match had been due to take place, tens of thousands of fans gathered at the Medellin stadium - and at Chapecoense's home ground in Chapeco - to pay tearful tributes.
Many wore white and carried candles as a mark of respect. Chapecoense lost 19 players in the crash. Twenty journalists were also killed.
Of the survivors, Chapecoense said that two players remained in a critical but stable condition, while the club's goalkeeper had had one leg amputated and might still lose his other foot.
An injured journalist also remained in critical condition, the club said.",Colombian authorities say evidence is growing that a plane carrying a Brazilian football team crashed because it ran out of fuel as it tried to land.,38165757
"Scarborough Council approved the £572,000 Coast Protection grant for ""urgent work"" at Flat Cliffs near Filey.
The area is expected to suffer from severe coastal erosion over the next 20 years.
It is hoped the works will ""buy more time"" for residents, the council said.
Sole access to Flats Cliffs is by one road through Primrose Valley holiday village.

The council said the action, together with ""soft engineering"" defences at the foot of the cliff, meant the houses would not be lost until nearer 2037.
Without it the residents would be forced to leave imminently.
""If no intervention is taken, [coastal erosion] will lead to imminent loss of the sole access road to Flat Cliffs,"" the council said.
""This would in effect 'write-off' the coastal community with immediate effect, rather than in 20 years when the onset of direct property loss is expected.""

"The diocese of St Asaph in Denbighshire has been providing packed lunches to children in Wrexham and Rhyl during the break.
About 150 meals were prepared in one day in Wrexham this week.
A church spokeswoman said: ""Coverage is at best patchy and mostly non-existent.""
Calls have been made for more to be done to ensure children who receive free school meals during term time are catered for during school holidays.
The Church in Wales told BBC Radio Cymru's Post Cyntaf: ""With no statutory provision in place to support children in holidays... feeding children during school holidays is falling to the voluntary sector.""
Dr Barry Morgan, the Archbishop of Wales, said: ""Our churches are based in every community in Wales and it's realised that during holiday times there are children who are going hungry because these are children who have free school meals during term time, who have no food during the holiday period.""
Labour said its Welsh Government had introduced the early years deprivation grant to ""support our youngest pupils from the poorest backgrounds"".
Plaid Cymru said ""holiday hunger"" would be part of its action plan on child poverty while the Liberal Democrats said it had proposed freeing up the criteria for Communities First so local authorities could fund such schemes.
UKIP said it would support others getting involved in this work.
A spokesman for the Welsh Conservatives said: ""By working with local communities, to plan a regeneration program which will focus on local organisations, to tackle poverty, we can provide new support networks across Wales.""","Children in poorer areas are going hungry during holiday periods when they are not getting free school meals, the Church in Wales has said.",35992116
"Prosecutors are expected to decide based on the hearing whether they will seek an arrest warrant for Mr Lee.
The firm is accused of giving donations to non-profit foundations run by a confidante of President Park Geun-hye in exchange for political favours.
""I will once again tell the truth,"" Mr Lee told reporters before the hearing.
The Samsung chief had already been questioned with several other company executives in January but a subsequent court ruling decided there was insufficient grounds for an arrest.
Yet during the past weeks investigators reviewed the case and decided there were new aspects that required further questioning.
The claims against the company revolve around a merger between the electronics giant's construction arm, Samsung C&T, and an affiliate firm, Cheil Industries.
The prosecution alleges that Samsung gave 2.8m euros ($3.1m; Â£2.5m) to a company co-owned by Park confidante Choi Soon-sil and her daughter, in return for political support for the deal.
The scandal led to President Park being impeached last December.
Lee Jae-yong, also known as Jay Y. Lee, first gave evidence in front of a parliamentary hearing in December last year. Since January he has been treated as an official suspect in the case.
At the parliamentary hearing, Samsung admitted giving a total of 20.4bn won (Â£16m; $17.46m) to the two foundations, but denied seeking favours in return.
And Mr Lee also confirmed the firm gave a horse and money to help the equestrian career of Ms Choi's daughter, Chung Yoo-ra, something he said he now regretted.
Mr Lee is currently vice-chairman of Samsung Electronics. But since his father, Lee Kun-hee, suffered a heart attack in 2014, he is considered de facto boss of the entire Samsung Group conglomerate.
- Grandson of Samsung founder  Lee Byung-chul, son of current chairman Lee Kun-hee.
- Aged 48, he's spent his entire career in the company and is vice chairman of Samsung Electronics.
- Last year was nominated to join the board of Samsung Electronics - an appointment confirmed on 27 October.
- Widely expected to take overall control of Samsung once his 74-year-old father steps down.
- Critics say his position on the board is due to his birth, not his business experience.
Politicians voted on 9 December to impeach President Park over the scandal - a decision South Korea's constitutional court has six months to uphold or overturn.
Until then she remains formally president but stripped of her powers, which are handed to the prime minister, a presidential appointee.
Ms Choi is on trial for charges including corruption and coercion.
Ms Park's position began to unravel in October last year when details of her friendship with Ms Choi began to emerge.
They included revelations that the president had allowed her old friend - who holds no government role - to edit political speeches.
Since then, hundreds of thousands of protestors have gathered every weekend in Seoul to demand Ms Park stands down.

"It was announced on Wednesday that the East Midlands Congenital Heart Centre, at Glenfield Hospital, was to stop children's surgery services.
It was one of 10 units under review nationally with the intention to focus expertise in fewer locations.
The charity Heartlink said it would not accept the judgement.
A spokesman for the charity, John Rigby, said: ""We're going to take stock, listen to what our reps have to say and be guided by them. We're going to fight to do our very best to keep children's services here [at Glenfield].""
The centre, which conducts about 230 operations on children and 70 on adults each year, has the UK's largest ECMO unit (a form of partial cardiopulmonary bypass) which oxygenates blood of critically ill patients.
The unit will stop surgery for children but will remain open to diagnose patients and for monitoring and non-surgical treatment.
It serves a population of about five million, with the next nearest similar unit in Birmingham, about 40 miles (64.4km) away.
Leslie Hamilton, vice chair of the Safe and Sustainable review's steering group, said that as surgeons they felt surgical expertise was spread too thinly around the country.
He said: ""We felt we had to concentrate the expertise and reduce the number of centres in the country so we could have bigger centres with bigger surgical teams.
""That would lead to sustainable care for the future and also a big improvement in care.""
Tony Fowlston has a three-year-old son, Lewis, who has been treated at Glenfield. The family travels a distance of about 60 miles (96.5km) from Boston, in Lincolnshire, to see specialists.

"Ads for foods considered unhealthy are already banned on children's television, but not online.
The Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP), which sets the rules for advertisers in the UK, will soon launch a public consultation on the issue.
A ban could affect content on services such as YouTube and ITV Hub.
In 2007, the broadcasting regulator Ofcom introduced strict rules banning the advertising of food high in fat, sugar and salt (HFSS) during television programmes likely to appeal to under-16s.
Those rules are enforced by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), which also regulates ""non-broadcast"" ads such as print, billboards and online streaming.
Many companies now use online video to promote products to young audiences.
The ASA's chief executive Guy Parker told an audience at the Westminster Food and Nutrition Forum that he was often asked why junk food ads were banned on television but allowed during the same programmes when streamed online.
The BBC understands the CAP will launch a public consultation on the subject before the summer.","Advertising junk food could soon be banned from children's content streamed online, according to the UK's advertising watchdog.",35803532
"The five-part series has received 3m requests on the catch-up service, more than the England v Wales match at Euro 2016 - which had 2.8m requests.
Seven of the 20 most popular iPlayer programmes were on BBC Three, which moved online earlier this year.
Murdered By My Father and the first episode of Greg Davies comedy Cuckoo each received more than 1.5m requests.
Other shows to pass the 1m request mark in 2016 included Fleabag, Life And Death Row, The Insider with Reggie Yates and Stacey Dooley documentary Sex In Strange Places.
BBC Three's iPlayer popularity comes in spite of it now offering fewer programmes.
When it became an online service in February, many shows - such as Don't Tell The Bride and Family Guy - were bought by other networks.
But the network continued to produce original programming for iPlayer and its other online services, including a bespoke YouTube channel.
Speaking about the latest figures, BBC Three controller Damian Kavanagh said: ""These are still early days for BBC Three and I'm incredibly proud of what we have achieved in such a short space of time.""
""Reinventing the BBC's offer for young people won't happen overnight, it's a marathon not a sprint, but the early signs are very encouraging.""
As part of BBC Three's move online, the channel committed to spending 20% of its Â£30m budget on non-TV content including written articles, animations and social media content, in an attempt to attract younger audiences.
The BBC Trust, which approved the move, said there was ""clear public value in moving BBC Three online, as independent evidence shows younger audiences are watching more online and watching less linear TV"".
However, commercial rivals claim that the amount of time young viewers consuming BBC content has fallen since BBC Three ceased broadcasting on television.
Thinkbox TV, whose shareholders include Sky, ITV and Channel 4, published a report on Monday suggesting commercial TV viewing by young people increased after BBC Three went online.
ITV2, which broadcasts a considerable number of youth-focused programmes such as Love Island, Family Guy and Celebrity Juice, saw an increase of 27% year-on-year in time viewers spent watching the channel between March and June.

"US TV network ABC also ordered a new spin-off show, Marvel's Agent Carter, based on Hayley Atwell's Captain America character.
Both series tie into the Marvel film series, which includes star-studded titles like Iron Man and Thor.
They add background to events on the big screen, providing an overarching story to the so-called Marvel Universe.
Agents Of Shield was created by Joss Whedon, who scripted the Avengers Assemble film, and previously created Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Firefly.
The drama resurrected the character of Agent Coulson, who was killed in Avengers Assemble, with his character's miraculous recovery the central mystery of the opening episodes.
Played by Clark Gregg, the character took charge of a team of law-enforcement agents, tasked with investigating super-human individuals and unusual events.
Eventually, the plot of the series overlapped with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, in which the SHIELD organisation was brought down from within.
When the series debuted in the US in September 2013, it garnered 12.12 million viewers, marking the biggest network drama debut in four years.
Audience figures fell by nearly 4 million between the first and second episode, while figures for recent episodes average 5.5 million.
In the UK, where it is shown on Channel 4, the show's audience has also plummeted - from 4.5 million in September 2013 to 1.1 million last week.
However, the series plays well with young men, a much sought-after demographic with advertisers, and its ratings tend to recover once time-delayed viewing is taken into account.
Agent Carter, which follows the story of secret agent Peggy Carter, is being hailed as a ""bridge show"", which will be screened during Agents Of Shields' mid-series hiatus.
Meanwhile, Marvel comics is preparing another four series - Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage - via its partnership with Netflix.","Despite struggling in the ratings, Marvel's Agents of Shield has been renewed for a second series.",27338698

The chair of the Crowborough school's governors, said it wanted to highlight the ""massive financial crisis"" all schools face under budget cuts.
The Department for Education (DoE) has admitted funding models are ""unfair"".
At a meeting later, parents will be told how cuts would affect the school.

Head teacher Laura Cooper said it was important parents were aware of ""the real financial pressures facing the school"".
In a letter on the non-uniform day, she said ""we would like the children to bring in various 'essential' items such as stationery (e.g. glue sticks, pencils, Blu Tack, boxes of tissues, sellotape, etc) and of course loo rolls"".
The Parents' Forum meeting later would focus on ""safeguarding the future of our school"", she added.
Rosie Wegeland, who has four children at the school, said the letter had ""really surprised"" her.
""This is the first time in seven years that they are asking for something else to be given to the school,"" she said.
In a separate letter earlier this month, head teachers from across East Sussex urged parents to lobby their local MPs and the education secretary ""to protest about the effects of funding cuts in schools"".
""The government claims that funding for schools has remained the same, but they do not mention that all schools face rising costs due to inflation and other extra charges recently introduced by the government,"" they said.

"Members of the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board meeting on Tuesday backed a report recommending that services are left unchanged.
Staff shortages prompted the move, with services at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Denbighshire threatened.
The board said following a recruitment drive staffing levels have recovered.
The health board first put forward plans to change maternity care in autumn 2014, prompting widespread protests.
The preferred proposal would have seen maternity doctors from Glan Clwyd Hospital transferred to strengthen teams at Bangor's Ysbyty Gwynedd and Wrexham Maelor Hospital.
That meant Glan Clwyd would have only had a stand alone midwife-led maternity unit for low-risk pregnancies.
Campaigners were set to challenge the decision through the courts and the board began a fresh consultation process over the summer.
Deputy Health Minister Vaughan Gething said: ""It has been important to give people certainty about the temporary options for women's and maternity services in north Wales.
""The approval of the recommendations by the board gives the public, staff, pregnant women and patients certainty for the immediate future.""
For the Tories, Shadow Health Minister Darren Millar said it was ""hugely welcome news and represents a victory for common sense"".
The Clwyd West AM added: ""It's now absolutely crucial that Labour ministers see through on their promise to swiftly establish the new neonatal intensive care centre for north Wales.""
Addressing the board members, medical director Prof Matt Makin said services were becoming unstable in 2014.
""It was a challenge in recruiting middle-grade doctors and alarm bells were ringing,"" he said.
""We've kept things safe, but we have been managing things in critical incident mode.
""What's changed is that there's been a really big push in recruiting new staff.  We appointed seven new consultants in late August.""
Prof Makin said the recruitment meant ""more boots on the ground"" for maternity services.
The board unanimously backed the report recommendations, which also included rejecting temporary changes at either Ysbyty Gwynedd or Wrexham Maelor.
However, the board has also been warned that further work will be needed to ""consider the long-term sustainable model"" for maternity services.

"Abdullah Mahmoud al-Khalidi was shot dead late on Monday in the capital's Rukn al-Din district, it said.
The attack appears to be the latest in a string of rebel attacks on high-level figures from President Bashar al-Assad's administration.
In July, a bomb killed the country's defence minister and Mr Assad's brother-in-law, Assef Shawkat.
""As part of their campaign to target national personalities and scientists, armed terrorist groups assassinated Air Force General Abdullah Mahmud al-Khalidi in the Damascus district of Rukn al-Din,"" the broadcaster said.
It added that he was one of Syria's foremost experts in aviation. He was also a member of the Syrian Air Force command, Agence France Presse reports.
The Free Syrian Army claimed that it was behind the attack, saying it had also killed an air force intelligence official in the same operation, AFP reports.
News of the attack came as violence continued in the capital and beyond.
Air strikes hit targets in Damascus and the wider province as well as the north-western province of Idlib and the central province of Homs, according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The group said that jets had carried out at least six air raids on Damascus suburbs, including Rankous and Harasta, and that there were intense clashes in those areas as troops attempted to wrestle control from the rebels.
""Members of the Free Syrian Army are shooting at the planes without succeeding in shooting them down,"" Mohammed Saeed, an activist based in the Damascus suburb of Douma, told the Associated Press.
Activists also reported that the northern rebel-held town of Maarat al-Numan, on the route between Damascus and Aleppo, had also come under fire.
A government official said a car bomb had killed 10 people on the outskirts of Damascus, AP reports.
An opposition activist group, the local Co-ordination Committees in Syria, said that a total of 61 people had died in Syria on Tuesday, among them four women and three children.
It said that a total of 29 had been reported killed in Idlib province, most of whom died after the shelling of Maarat al-Numan.

"He won the £25,000 award for self-released album Konnichiwa, which covers topics including police harassment and his anger at British politics.
The record, described by the NME as a ""landmark in British street music"", went to number two earlier this year.
""I'm just so thankful. I've been trying to do this music stuff and work it out for so long,"" Skepta said of his win.
Speaking to the BBC backstage, he said he would use the prize money to help the disadvantaged.
""Something positive, something to help other people feel as happy and as free as me,"" he said.
""We're doing a project right now, actually, building a studio in my old estate to help the young kids do music.""
Skepta's victory meant that bookmakers' favourite David Bowie missed out after receiving a posthumous nomination for his swansong album, Blackstar.
Judge Jarvis Cocker said the jury had faced a tough decision deciding between the two records, which had been whittled down from a longlist of 12.
""In the end, the winner came down to a contest between two black stars,"" he said.
""And we, as a jury, decided that if Bowie was looking down on the Hammersmith Apollo tonight, he would want the 2016 Hyundai Mercury Music Prize to go to Skepta.""
Other albums shortlisted for the 2016 prize included Michael Kiwanuka's Love & Hate, and Bat For Lashes' The Bride - a concept record about a woman whose fiancé is killed in a car crash while driving to their wedding.
Radiohead received a record fifth nomination for their record A Moon Shaped Pool but went home empty-handed again.
Perhaps sensing that the odds were stacked against them, the band were absent from the ceremony, instead sending a video for the ballad Present Tense.
All of the other acts performed on the night, with actor Michael C Hall performing David Bowie's song Lazarus, which opens with the lyrics:  ""Look up here, I'm in heaven.""
The star of Dexter and Six Feet Under will soon be seen in London in the lead role in Bowie's musical - also called Lazarus - which premiered in New York shortly before his death.
Hall said it was a great responsibility to be representing the musician on the stage where he had famously ""killed"" his Ziggy Stardust character.
""I'm trying not to spend too much time dwelling on the reality of the situation for fear that it will overwhelm me. It's beyond anything I ever anticipated but I'm really humbled and honoured to be asked to do it.""
Skepta was born Joseph Junior Adenuga 33 years ago in Tottenham, London, and started making music in the early 2000s.
He rode the first wave of grime to a contract with Universal Records, but his sound was watered down and they soon parted ways.
Konnichiwa was the result of a major shift in the star's life.
""I had friends that died, and I had to realise that I don't care about certain things I used to care about before"".
It prompted him to return to the music he loved, reaching out directly to fans via social media.
In 2014, he released That's Not Me, a rapid-fire freestyle that atoned for losing sight of his roots: ""I used to wear Gucci / I put it all in the bin cause that's not me.""
Accompanied by a video that cost £80, it went on to win a MOBO award and showed the star he could make it on his own terms.
Accepting the Mercury Prize, he said: ""I was like' let's do it for ourselves'.
""All these songs, we've travelled the world - no record label, nothing. We just did this for us but the love is very appreciated.
""We all won today. Konnichiwa!""
Skepta is the second grime artist to win the Mercury, following Dizzee Rascal's victory in 2003.
His win marks the commercial resurgence of the genre, with Skepta key in helping recalibrate the sound back towards its inner city roots.

"The former Army officer said torture was ""sometimes"" justified, and he had used now-forbidden techniques.
The UK government authorised the use of five interrogation methods during the Troubles but later reversed that move.
Col Stewart made his comments in a BBC Radio 5 Live interview after remarks about torture made by Donald Trump.
The US president said senior intelligence officials have told him torture ""absolutely works"".
He suggested the illegal waterboarding interrogation technique could be reintroduced in order to fight radical groups in the Middle East.
Col Stewart said ""no-one likes torture - not even Trump likes torture"".
""The fact of the matter is, as we both accept, sometimes it might work, and sometimes it might be justified,"" he said.
""In circumstances where a great number of people, or indeed one person, is going to be killed, you have to think very carefully about what pressure you can put on people in order to give that information to stop peoples' lives being lost.
""A certain amount of persuasion might be justified if someone, for example, had the knowledge about where a nuclear weapon that was going to explode in London was.""
But the Beckenham MP said he was ""qualifying"" his suggestion that torture could be justified, and added that he does not agree with the use of waterboarding.
He referred to his own experiences as a soldier during the Troubles, saying he had used techniques that were legal at the time but later banned by the UK government.
""So, in a way, technically, as you look at it today, I was a kind of a torturer,"" Col Stewart added.
""Of course, it was acceptable then - it's now unacceptable and now it's defined as torture.""
Controversy still surrounds the Army's use of what it called ""deep interrogation"" techniques during the Troubles.
The government is facing a legal challenge from several men, who claim they were tortured by the Army during the conflict, for its failure to fully investigate their case.
Known as the Hooded Men, they were arrested on suspicion of terror offences and imprisoned without trial in August 1971.
Jim McIlmurray, case coordinator for the Hooded Men, said Col Stewart's admission did not come ""as any great surprise"".
""I consider the remarks by Bob Stewart somewhat boastful and arrogant and will request our legal team to call upon him as a witness seeing he is so forthcoming with this new information,"" he said.
The Hooded Men claim they were subjected to torture techniques, including food and sleep deprivation and constant loud static noise for long periods of time.
The European Commission of Human Rights ruled in 1976 that the government was guilty of torture and inhumane and degrading treatment.
But the government appealed and the European Court of Human Rights later ruled that the techniques did not amount to torture.
The men want the decision to be revised and are also seeking to secure a full inquiry.
The government has consistently rejected allegations of torture.","Conservative MP Bob Stewart has said he was ""kind of a torturer"" during his time as a soldier in Northern Ireland's Troubles in the 1970s.",38758940
"In its first formal legal response to the request for audio recordings to be handed over, Amazon said prosecutors had  failed to establish it was necessary.
It said that it had to weigh customer privacy against such requests.
Prosecutors argue that the data could throw light on what happened.
Police want any information from the Echo that may be on Amazon's servers on the night of Victor Collins' death.
Mr Collins was found floating face up in a friend's hot tub in November 2015. The friend, James Andrew Bates, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder.
The suspect called the Bentonville, Arkansas police department to say he had found the body.
According to court records, one of the deceased's eyes and his lips appeared to be swollen and suspected blood spots were found around the rim of the hot tub.
Detectives said they learned that music had been streamed to the back patio at the time of death, which they said may have been controlled via the Echo's smart assistant Alexa.
Lawyers for Amazon filed a motion last week asking a judge to throw out requests for Echo data to be handed over: ""Given the important First Amendment and privacy implications at stake, the warrant should be quashed unless the Court finds that the State has met its heightened burden for compelled production of such materials,"" its court filings read.
And, in a statement to Associated Press, the firm added: ""Amazon will not release customer information without a valid and binding legal demand properly served on us. Amazon objects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course,"" the company said in a statement.
The ""always on"" Echo speaker makes recordings of audio it hears from a fraction of a second before it detects a wake word - either Alexa or Amazon - until it judges the command to be over.
This audio is then transmitted to Amazon's computer servers, which interpret the request and tell it how to respond.
Although no recordings are meant to be made at other times, the device often becomes activated when it misinterprets speech as being its wake command.
Any captured audio might therefore have identified who was active in the early hours of the morning when the alleged murder is thought to have taken place, as well as what was said. Mr Bates claims to have been asleep at the time.
In December 2016, Amazon was issued with two search warrants but refused to share information sent by the smart device to its servers.",Amazon is continuing to resist efforts  by prosecutors in a US murder case to obtain recordings from one of its Echo smart speakers.,39063113

"Wildest Dreams was filmed on location in Botswana and South Africa but some fans have complained that the video hardly features any black Africans.
Director Joseph Kahn said the story line of the video is focused on a film crew visiting parts of the continent in the 1950s and that it would have been rewriting history to include more black people.
Some fans have accused the video of showing an image of Africa that is old fashioned and offensive.
Taylor Swift has not commented on the controversy around the video but in a statement Kahn denied that the video only includes white people.
He said: ""The reality is not only were there people of colour in the video, but the key creatives who worked on this video are people of colour.""

"Originally an innovation for television coverage of cricket, Hawk-Eye has become a trusted tool for officials in cricket, tennis and now football.
When the company was launched in 2001, it had two full-time employees based in Winchester.
Fast-forward to 2013 and it is now owned by Sony, has 65 full-time staff and the technology is installed in 230 stadiums worldwide.
Dr Paul Hawkins came up with the idea in 1999 and after 18 months of development, the technology made its debut during Channel 4's coverage of the 2001 Ashes series.
A Royal Society Television Award for technical innovation followed, and the company Hawk-Eye Innovations Ltd was established - with a focus on developing the technology for use in tennis.
A year later, Hawk-Eye was used in this way for the first time during the BBC's Davis Cup coverage. It received two more TV awards for innovation in 2003 and 2004, including an Emmy.
After some controversial line-calls in major tennis matches, some questioned whether the technology could be used for more than just the benefit of a TV audience.
The International Tennis Federation eventually approved the use of Hawk-Eye as an aid to be used by umpires, should any judgements be disputed or too close to call.
Hawk-Eye was first used in a tennis tournament in 2005, making its official Wimbledon debut in 2007.
Despite being praised by many, not everyone has been in favour of the technology.
Most notably, 17-time Grand Slam winner Roger Federer has said in the past that Hawk-Eye is not accurate enough and has even called for it to be scrapped.
But such criticism has not hindered the technology's global success, and in 2011 the company was bought by Sony for an undisclosed sum.
The firm's staff and developers are now based at Sony's European headquarters in Basingstoke, Hampshire, where the units are put together in a warehouse on site.
A number of staff are also based abroad, following tennis tours and working at international stadiums.
The company had a setback in early 2013, when it missed out on the contract to supply goal-line technology for the 2014 World Cup to its German rival, GoalControl.
But the Premier League deal confirms Hawk-Eye as a leading player in football's greater use of technology to assist officials.

"Scientists at Heriot-Watt University have been investigating how oil flows through the tiny pore spaces in otherwise solid rock.
They claimed the principle can be applied to the movement of blood.
They said this could be important in the treatment of cancer.
The work has won a Queen's Anniversary Prize from the Royal Anniversary Trust which recognises innovative work across different disciplines.
It was carried out by Heriot-Watt's Institute of Petroleum Engineering which has been focusing on experiments and computer simulation of fluid flow in porous media, such as rock and subsea surfaces.
Its director, Prof Dorrik Stow, said: ""The Institute has developed mathematical models which demonstrate how oil, water and gas are transported through narrow pathways that form inside porous media.
""But it became apparent that similar modelling techniques could apply to work in the field of blood vessel development.""
He said this was important because the of the way blood vessels develop around a tumour, making them less effective in delivering treatments to combat the disease.
The institute's work on oil flow could help scientists understand how anti-cancer treatments could more effectively target tumours.
He said: ""Areas of mathematical biology, the dynamic modelling of blood capillaries and the subsequent simulation of intravenous chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic treatments (treatments which inhibit blood vessel formation), are initial areas where the institute's techniques have created a new strand of research, as all of these processes depend crucially upon the blood flow within the vascular network.""

She said her design depicted Pankhurst ""as the courageous, determined and dignified activist"".
""In 2019, she will be back on Manchester's streets, continuing to inspire women to rise up and demand their rights,"" she said.
The privately-funded statue will be the city's second with a female subject, with the other being a sculpture of Queen Victoria in Piccadilly Gardens.
Andrew Simcock, who chaired the campaign fighting for the statue, said the lack of women had sparked people into action.
""As a radical city with a history of strong female figures, it is wrong that our public art does not reflect this part of Manchester's heritage,"" he said.
He added when they had been searching for a subject, the public had ""voted overwhelmingly"" for a statue of Pankhurst.
It will be the second statue of Emmeline Pankhurst in the UK, as a memorial to her and her daughter Christobel, who was also an activist, stands in London's Victoria Tower Gardens, close to the Palace of Westminster.
Ms Reeves has previously created a number of public statues, including depictions of railway engineer Sir Nigel Gresley at London's King's Cross Station and Sadako Sasaki, who survived the Hiroshima atomic blast before later dying of cancer.","A new statue of Emmeline Pankhurst will ""inspire women to rise up and demand their rights"", its creator has said.",39491987

"Transport bosses want to build an alternative Metrolink route called the Second City Crossing (2CC) by 2016.
As consultation gets under way, companies have been warned they could face years of ""major disruption"".
Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce is urging small businesses to find out how the proposals will affect them.
Richard Critchley, the chamber's policy manager for transport, agreed congestion was a major problem for struggling businesses.
But he said the construction of a second city crossing was ""vital for the future expansion of Metrolink"".
""There will be a huge disruption during the construction phase - that's inevitable with any major project like this,"" he said.
""There will be a number of permanent road closures and they will impact on businesses in the long term so people need to look at these plans now.""
If approved, construction of the 2CC scheme would begin in 2013 with the extension up and running by late 2016.
The proposed tram link would take passengers on a new line from St Peter's Square to Victoria Station via Princess Street and Cross Street.
The existing tram stop in St Peter's Square would be moved and a new stop would be created at Exchange Square.
But a section of Princess Street would be closed to all traffic except buses and taxis, effectively cutting the city in two and blocking off an east-west through route via Bridge Street and John Dalton Street.
Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) acknowledged the difficulties facing small businesses but said its strategy was to support a ""strong and prosperous economy"".
However, it said that with passenger numbers set to to treble by 2021, an alternative city centre route was ""essential"" to cope with increased demand created by expansion of the Metrolink network.
A new line to MediaCityUK has recently opened and Metrolink extensions to Chorlton, Droylsden, Oldham and Rochdale will open during 2011 and 2012.
In addition, Metrolink extensions are under way from Chorlton to East Didsbury, from Droylsden to Ashton-under-Lyne town centre, through Oldham and Rochdale town centres and to Manchester Airport.
TfGM is also working with Manchester City Council to accommodate the new tram link with plans to pedestrianise St Peter's Square and relocate the Cenotaph to a position close to the Town Hall.
Public consultation on the crossing and Cenotaph plans will continue until 9 September, details of which can be found on the TfGM website.","Business leaders in Manchester have said plans for a new cross-city tram link are ""vital"", despite concerns that small businesses could be hit hard.",13684701
