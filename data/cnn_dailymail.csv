"(CNN) -- At least 70 people are reported to have died from Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Guinea, according to a statement from the West African nation's health ministry. Officials say there are at least 111 suspected cases of the viral disease, which spreads in the blood and shuts down the immune system, causing high fever, headache and muscle pain. The virus is transmitted by contact with the fluids of infected people or animals. Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) describes Ebola as ""one of the world's most deadly diseases."" It is rare, but it creates panic, because there is no cure and it's fatal in most cases, according to MSF. ""The priority is to isolate suspected cases,"" said MSF, which has set up two isolation facilities in the most affected districts, Gueckedou and Macenta, both in southern Guinea. Four of the fatalities from the disease are in Conakry, the capital city, which is on the coast. Genetic analysis of the virus shows that it is closely related to Zaire Ebola virus, which was reported in 2009 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Senegal's Interior Ministry decided to close its border with Guinea until further notice to prevent the spread of the disease, according to Senegal's state news agency. The World Health Organization says that, to date, no confirmed cases of Ebola have been found outside of Guinea, but at least 12 suspected cases are under investigation in neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone. Joseph Netto and Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report.","Death toll from an Ebola outbreak in Guinea reaches 70, including 4 in the capital .

"(CNN) -- An Ohio jury on Monday will begin the sentencing phase for convicted serial killer Anthony Sowell, ultimately deciding whether he should receive life in prison or the death penalty for killing 11 Cleveland-area women between 2007 and 2009. Jurors on July 22 convicted Sowell of 11 counts of aggravated murder and more than 70 other charges, including abusing corpses and kidnapping. The sole not-guilty verdict came on an aggravated robbery charge. During the sentencing phase, Sowell will be able to make a statement on his own behalf without being under oath or facing cross-examination from prosecutors, said Ryan Miday, a spokesman for the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office. The defense can also call expert witnesses to discuss Sowell's background, including his childhood and his military service. Sowell has been classified as a ""sexually violent predator,"" meaning parole is not an option, Miday said. If jurors decide to recommend that Sowell die for his crimes, the judge can overrule that recommendation and impose a life sentence. But if jurors decide to spare Sowell's life, the judge cannot impose a death sentence, said Greg Popovich, Cuyahoga County court administrator. Sowell's convictions ended a saga that began in October 2009 with the discovery of the first two victims' remains inside Sowell's home. He eventually was accused of killing at least 11 women ranging in age from 25 to 52. He grew up in East Cleveland, joined the Marines at age 18 and traveled to California, North Carolina and Japan, authorities said. Sowell served 15 years in prison for attempted rape before being released in 2005. People who met him after his release described him as ""a normal guy."" He was known locally for selling scrap metal. Sowell's inconspicuous two-story home sat in a dilapidated neighborhood known as Mount Pleasant, where at one point one in five homes was in foreclosure and at least a third of the residents received food stamps, according to a 2010 study by Case Western Reserve University's Center on Urban Poverty and Community Development. A stench hovered around the area, but no one realized it was the scent of decaying human flesh, instead assuming it was a byproduct of a nearby sausage factory. Many of Sowell's victims struggled with drug addiction at some point, and court records showed many resorted to stealing and prostitution to support their habits. The disappearances of the women -- many of whom lived near him -- went largely unnoticed for two years, with only four women being reported missing. In late 2008, a woman named Gladys Wade told police that a man in a gray hoodie offered her beer, and when she declined he punched her in the face several times. Wade said he then attempted to rape her, dragging her toward his home, and that she escaped after ""gouging his face."" Police investigated Wade's complaint, and one police report noted the presence of blood droplets on Sowell's walls and steps. But officers told CNN affiliate WKYC that the case was dropped after Wade declined to press charges. Six more women disappeared after her complaint. The first bodies were discovered after a 36-year-old Cleveland woman told police a story similar to that of Wade, as well as the woman whose 1989 account led to Sowell's attempted rape conviction. She said he had invited her into his home for beer, punched her in the face and began performing oral sex on her -- letting her go only after she promised to return the next day. Most of the women whose remains were found in and around Sowell's home had been strangled by ligature, which can include a string, cord or wire, and at least one had been strangled by hand, officials said. Seven women still had ligatures wrapped around their necks. A skull was all that remained of one victim; it had been wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed in a bucket in the home's basement. At Sowell's trial, his defense rested without calling any witnesses or presenting any evidence, according to CNN affiliate WOIO. His defense attorneys have declined previous requests by CNN to explain their case.","Anthony Sowell will receive life in prison without parole or the death penalty .

"Las Vegas (CNN)Tammy Meyers and Erich Nowsch were neighbors. Their homes are walking distance from each other and from a park. It was in that park where, according to Meyers' husband, she used to talk to the young man, where she implored him to act like an adult. On Thursday, Nowsch was arrested, accused of killing Meyers in what has been described as a road rage incident that ended a week ago with a shooting in front of Meyers' home. ""We know this boy. I couldn't tell you this before,"" Robert Meyers told reporters after the arrest. ""He knew where I lived. We knew how bad he was, but we didn't know it was this bad. That he'd gotten to this point, and his friends."" Nowsch, 19, faces three felony charges: murder, attempted murder and unlawful discharge of a gun from a vehicle. A Monday morning court hearing has been scheduled. Robert Meyers said his wife tried to help Nowsch. ""My wife spent countless hours at that park consoling this boy,"" he said. ""She was really good to him. She fed him, she gave him money. She told him to pull his pants up and to be a man. More times than I can count."" Police said they are looking for at least one more suspect, but they believe Nowsch was the shooter. Homicide Capt. Chris Tomaino told reporters that he owned registered firearms but wouldn't say how many guns or what type of weapons they were. It was unclear Thursday night whether Nowsch had an attorney; court documents detailing his charges didn't list a lawyer. Nowsch was taken into custody in the afternoon after a brief, tense standoff at his mother's home, which is one street over from the Meyers' house. Police have said the shooting followed a road-rage incident that took place last week near a junior high school where Meyers gave her 15-year-old daughter a night-time driving lesson. As Meyers drove the less than half mile home, a car sped by and her daughter reached over and honked at the driver. Police said the car stopped and the driver got out to confront the Meyerses. Robert Meyers told HLN's Nancy Grace on Thursday that the man threatened to kill his wife and daughter. Tammy Meyers, 44, took off for home and sent her daughter inside. Lt. Ray Steiber, a Las Vegas homicide detective, said earlier this week that the daughter was asked to send her 22-year-old brother out. He brought with him a gun he owned. Steiber said Meyers then went looking for the road rage suspect, but, according to her husband, she just wanted to keep the situation away from the house. ""She just didn't want it to come back here. She tried to get him to go somewhere else,"" he said. Robert Meyers, who was out of town when his wife was shot, said the other car followed the Meyers and at some point away from the house there were gunshots. Tammy Meyers fled home and told her son to take cover as she parked in front of the house. The car -- with three people inside, the family has said -- approached. Meyers' son told police that they were fired upon, and he defended him and his mother. His father says he took three or four shots and found his mother mortally wounded. The father defended the family against criticism that they should have gone into the house when mother and daughter arrived after the road rage incident. ""My son is a good boy. His mom was a good mommy,"" Robert Meyers said. During a standoff at Nowsch's house earlier Thursday, Robert Meyers chastised reporters, whom he felt were placing blame on his loved ones. ""Are you all happy? You made my wife look like an animal ... and my son. There's the animal, a block away. Are you happy?"" Robert Meyers screamed. Police are looking for a second suspect, Tomaino, the homicide captain, said. He wouldn't say whether that person was the suspect depicted in a drawing handed out by police. The captain said authorities were unaware until Thursday that the Meyers family knew Nowsch. He is being held at the Clark County Detention Center. CNN's Sara Sidner reported from Las Vegas and Steve Almasy wrote this article in Atlanta.

"LOS ANGELES, California -- On Earth Day on Wednesday, Dr. David Jentsch marched at the head of a column of UCLA students and faculty members to the chant of, ""Stand up for science!"" Across the street a smaller but equally vocal group of animal rights advocates chanted, ""U-C-L-A, how many animals have you killed today!"" Animal rights activists say large numbers of animals are killed each year during medical trials. Until recently, Jentsch had never dreamed he would lead a political demonstration. But Jentsch's life took a sharp turn last month when his car was firebombed in his driveway. A radical group of animal rights activists claimed responsibility for the act. ""This is terror,"" Jentsch said. ""There is no two ways about it. It's extremism. It's an attempt to intimidate."" It was the latest in a string of arson attacks against UCLA researchers who use animals in medical research projects. Since 2006, there have been seven attacks aimed at researcher's homes or cars. No arrests have been made in the cases, which are being investigated by an FBI lead task force on terrorism. ""We believe it's just a matter of time before someone is going to be hurt,"" said FBI Assistant Director in Charge Salvador Hernandez. ""The intent of these groups is to intimidate and coerce."" Hernandez heads up the task force investigating the series of attacks and says their actions qualify as terrorist attacks. But animal rights advocate Chris DeRose says nothing could be further from the truth . ""There has never been one human being in this country being killed or even hurt,"" he said. He believes the university researchers are the bad guys. ""What I do condemn is what goes on behind those walls,"" he says. DeRose, founder of Last Chance for Animals, says he doesn't condone firebombing researchers' homes, but he doesn't condemn it either.  Watch people against animal research at protest » . ""The reason these people are doing it is because they have been pushed ... nobody is listening ... over a hundred million animals a year are killed in universities and major hospitals in this country,"" he said. Jentsch argues that same medical research using lab animals has lead to many medical breakthroughs that benefit mankind. UCLA points to research advances in breast cancer treatments, Parkinson's disease and artificial heart technology that relied on experiments involving lab animals at their California facilities. Jentsch's own research involves studies aimed at treating drug addiction in humans. He studies the brains of monkeys that have been injected with methamphetamine. He says his experiments are peer-reviewed and adhere strictly to established rules for the treatment of lab animals.  Watch supporters of animal research at protest » . Jentsch says that he hopes that this week's dueling demonstrations can lead to a dialogue. He believes many of the protestors voicing opposition to the UCLA labs do not endorse the string of violent acts aimed against him and other researchers, ""but it is essential for them to repudiate this type of activity."" In the meantime, Jentsch says he refuses to be intimidated. ""I'm going to continue to live where I live, continue to educate people about my work,"" he said. ""I'm not going to stop.""","Dr. David Jentsch joins protest after his car was firebombed last month .

"David Cameron has warned that Europe must get tougher with Vladimir Putin – or risk repeating the mistakes it made with Hitler. He compared the response to Russian aggression with the disastrous appeasement of the Nazi dictator at the Munich conference in 1938. Demanding a firmer line against Moscow’s stance in Ukraine, the Prime Minister voiced fears that Russia intends to conquer the rest of the country. David Cameron has warned that Europe must get tougher with Vladimir Putin or risk repeating the mistakes it made with Hitler . Mr Cameron made the private remarks to other EU leaders at a summit in Brussels on Saturday, according to Italian newspaper La Repubblica. He was quoted as saying: ‘We run the  risk of repeating the mistakes made in Munich in 1938. We cannot know what will happen next. This time we cannot meet Putin’s demands. ‘He has already taken Crimea and we cannot allow him to take the whole  country.’ His reported comments come after Mr Putin threatened he could ‘take Kiev in a fortnight’ during a phone  call with EU Commission president Manuel Barroso. Demanding a firmer line against Moscow's stance in Ukraine, the Prime Minister voiced fears that Russia intends to conquer the rest of the country . German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told the Brussels summit that the Russian leader was ‘moving towards military escalation’ and there are ‘no limits to the unpredictability of Putin’. Mr Cameron has denounced the presence of up to 15,000 Russian troops on Ukrainian soil as ‘unjustified and unacceptable’. On Monday he told MPs that Moscow, which has already seized Crimea, was  trying to force its neighbour to ‘abandon  its democratic choices at the barrel of  a gun’. He will chair a Nato conference  in Wales later this week in which a new  force of 10,000 troops are expected to  be announced. Last night it was reported that Britain is to order 600 Army infantry vehicles as  part of its commitment to raise defence spending. Defence minister Julian Brazier said a  platoon may also be sent in a fortnight to join Rapid Trident, the joint US–Ukraine exercise. In a speech today, Defence  Secretary Michael Fallon will warn that Nato’s ‘credibility’ depends on European leaders boosting military spending. Only four members of the alliance – the US, UK, Estonia and Greece – meet a pledge to spend at least 2 per cent of their GDP on defence. Mr Fallon will tell the Royal United Services Institute think-tank: ‘Nato was formed on the basis that Europe would pay her way. Like any insurance policy, defence only pays out when you pay in. ‘US taxpayers won’t go on picking up the cheque if we choose to prioritise social  welfare spending when the threats are on our doorstep.’ Russia has boosted defence spending by 50 per cent and has pledged to spend another £420billion over the next six years.   The Munich summit is now seen as the high point of the British and French appeasement of Adolf Hitler. Afterwards, prime minister Neville  Chamberlain declared he had agreed ‘peace for our time’. However, appeasement allowed Germany to annexe parts of Czechoslovakia and is seen as encouraging further Nazi aggression and the outbreak of the Second World War.","Compared the response to Russian .

Lopez and Aurelien Rougerie combined to find Wesley Fofana unmarked in support on the left flank, but Cipriani denied him a try with a vital cover tackle. Clermont led moments later when fly-half Lopez kicked a penalty, but the visitors were dealt a blow when Rougerie succumbed to an arm injury and was replaced by Jonathan Davies. Sale soon responded with a routine penalty from Cipriani, but Clermont remained dangerous when on the attack. In the 17th minute, it took a fine tackle to deny Nick Abendanon as the former Bath full-back threatened to burst clear inside Sale's 22-metre line.

Clermont continued to ask questions of the hosts, but they struggled to create genuine try-scoring opportunities. Cipriani had a chance to put Sale ahead in the 28th minute but his long-range penalty, after Clermont were punished for putting hands in the ruck, sailed wide of the target. Sale made another injury-enforced change six minutes before half-time when winger Will Addison was forced off and replaced by Nick MacLeod. Shortly before the break, Lopez booted another well-placed penalty to put Clermont 6-3 up at the interval. Sale began brightly after the restart and penned Clermont back inside their own half during the opening exchanges.

"A friendly tiger shark that is a favorite among tourists at a popular Bahamas diving spot appears to have survived a bullet to a head, with photos showing noticeable entry and exit wounds. The shark is known in the area around Tiger Beach - a diving section in West End on Grand Bahama Island, off the coast of Florida - as 'Hook' because she was once caught by a fisherman and suffered a broken jaw, which 'slightly hangs down on the right side of her mouth'. According to Eli Martinez, an editor at Shark Diver Magazine, Hook is the oldest shark in the area, having been seen in the surrounding waters since 2007. However she turned up recently with what appeared to be a 'horrific' bullet wound in her head. Shocking: New photos of a female shark known as 'Hook' show her with a bullet wound to her head. Divers in Tiger Beach on Grand Bahama Island say there are noticeable entry and exit wounds . Shark Diver Magazine posted the news to Facebook with pictures taken during a diving expedition last month. The magazine said they had not seen Hook since December, and where shocked when they saw what happened to her. ' Someone tried to kill her,' the magazine posted to their Facebook. 'It looks like a bang stick was used, my guess is a spear fisherman? 'Or possibly she came up to a boat to steal a fish off their line and they tried to shoot her? 'The bullet went in on one side and out on the other.' Friendly: Hook, who is currently pregnant, is one of the main attractions among divers in Tiger Beach. Tour operators use bait to lure the sharks, who are typically friendly because they have been fed . Luckily, the magazine reported that Hook appeared to be fine. 'She looks like she is going to be ok. But the scar was horrific.,' they posted. 'She is pregnant right now and will be pupping in the next few months. '(It) made me sad to see my old friend like this.' According to Grind TV, the tour operators that organize dives in Tiger Beach use bait to lure sharks.

"(CNN) -- Authorities searched Tuesday for a man they say sexually assaulted and stabbed a lone hiker at Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee. The National Park Service released a sketch and offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrator in Friday afternoon's assault on Gatlinburg Trail near the city of the same name. The 44-year-old victim, who officials said did not know her attacker, managed to make her way afterward to Gatlinburg Bypass, where she flagged down a motorist, officials said. Rangers and National Park Service special agents were working more than 50 leads received on a tip line, said Molly Schroer, spokeswoman for the park, the most visited in the nation. What's in a trail hiker's backpack? The suspect was described as a white male in his 40s, of thin build, about 5 feet 9 inches tall, with a dirty blond crew cut and a thin mustache. He was wearing glasses, black dress pants and a gray T-shirt. Multiple tattoos include an unknown word across his abdomen. The hiker suffered multiple stab wounds on her neck, shoulder and hand. She was airlifted to the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville, where she was released Sunday. Schroer said the woman's permanent residency is in Kentucky, but she had been ""temporarily"" residing in the Gatlinburg area. Georgia hiker's mom says showing grisly photos adds to grief . ""We stand committed to bringing this assailant to justice,"" Chief Ranger Clay Jordan said in a statement released Monday.

"(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton's assertion this week she and her husband left the White House ""dead broke"" left some Americans scratching their heads. How, they wondered, could a family making six-figures, living rent free, and writing best-sellers possibly run out of cash? As it turns out, being President doesn't necessarily come cheap. While first families don't have to pay rent at the White House, they are responsible for personal costs that can multiply, especially if they spend the full eight years in that spotlight. Former first lady Laura Bush wrote in her post-White House memoir that she was expected to pick up the tab for every meal she ate at the White House or the presidential Camp David retreat -- for her husband's two terms.

A mother's admission that she only bathes her three-month-old son once a week - if that - has sparked a fierce parenting debate. Part-time blogger Claire Goss, 32, from Ashland, MA, made the candid statement on Babble in a post titled 'Do You Actually Need to Bathe Baby', prompting fellow users to brand her 'lazy' and 'gross'. Today, the mother-of-three defended her parenting, telling ABC News: 'I aim for once a week. It might not happen. I will confess, it has gone longer than a week. . . It can be a good 10 days, but if you met my baby and held him, you'd probably think he smells as amazing as I do.' Too busy: Mother-of-three Claire Goss has admitted that she only bathes her three-month-old son Charlie once a week - if that. Fellow parents are now divided on whether she is right or wrong . Mrs Goss says that a bath every evening was a routine with her first child, now five, but since then she finds she no longer has the time. 'My first baby got her daily baths, sometimes two bathes a day,' she said. But when her pediatrician warned her that her second child's skin was getting dried out from too many baths, she eased up. Now baby Charlie's nighttime routine involves a diaper change, and washing his hands and face. 'In my gut I don't think he needs it,' she said. 'He is a happy baby, he is a healthy baby. . . What I realized now after five years of parenting children is, he's not a dirty kid, he's a baby.' New routine: Mrs Goss says that her first child was bathed every night, but when her pediatrician warned her that her second child's skin was getting dried out from too many baths, she eased up . But while a nightly bath may not be essential for babies, it seems fellow parents are loathe to leave it as long as Mrs Goss. Nina Postans, from Brooklyn, NY, says she bathes her three-month-old, Madeleine, every day as part of a bedtime ritual. 'In my gut I don't think he needs more frequent baths. He is a happy baby, he is a healthy baby' 'They are at a crucial age where they need to establish a sleep routine and having a nightly bath (water is fine - you don't need to use soap all the time!) is part of this,' she told MailOnline. 'Most babies actually enjoy being bathed plus it's ultra soothing for them. 'Babies also drool a lot at 3 months so if you're not washing their neck creases every day you're in for a delightful funky smell!' she added. But fellow mother-of-one MaryBeth Long, from Westchester, NY, found that twice a week was best for her daughter, Kyra. 'Pre-crawling I probably bathed my . daughter twice a week because greasy hair isn't cute on anyone,' she . said. 'Now that she's a toddler I bathe her every other day since she's . an avid fan of rolling in the dirt.' Mother knows best: Mrs Goss says that every mom has the best gut instincts about their own baby, and that little Charlie smells 'amazing' Psychologist and mother Stephanie Manes tells MailOnline that a potential risk in passing up bath time is that the infant may be losing out on a powerful moment of maternal connection. 'The . bathing ritual can play an important developmental role for a child in . that it offers a powerful opportunity for mother infant bonding,' she . says. 'Ideally, the bath is a time for physical closeness along with . face to face contact when the mom can follow her baby's gaze - . experiences that foster healthy attachment.' The American Academy of Pediatrics advises parents to bathe babies at least three times a week, but acknowledges that 'too much bathing can decrease babies' natural bacteria count and make them more susceptible to infections and . rash.' 'We've . learned now that baby skin is very different than adult skin,' Dr Alan . Greene, a California-based pediatrician, told ABC News. 'Really, you want to . watch your baby more than watching the calendar when deciding to give a . bath.' And Mrs Goss echoes this: 'Mothers know their babies,' she said. 'They have gut feelings about their babies, and I would never presume to tell you how often to bathe your baby.'","Part-time blogger Claire Goss, 32, from Ashland, MA, says she is too busy to give baby Charlie a nighttime bath .

"A former well-respected University of Pittsburgh Medical Center researcher on Wednesday was sentenced to a mandatory life term without possibility of parole in the cyanide killing of his neurologist wife. Robert Ferrante, 66, was convicted in November of first-degree murder in the April 2013 death of 41-year-old Dr. Autumn Klein. Prosecutors said he laced her energy drink with deadly poison. The victim's mother, Lois Klein, said in a statement read in court during sentencing by an assistant prosecutor that the murder had robbed her and her husband of their only child. Scroll down for video . Locked away: Dr Robert Ferrante, 66, on Wednesday was sentenced to a mandatory life term without possibility of parole in the cyanide killing of his neurologist wife . Guilty: Ferrante (left) was convicted in November of first-degree murder in the April 2013 death of 41-year-old Dr. Autumn Klein (right) She said, 'The light of our lives has now been extinguished.' The statement went on to say: 'I certainly don't want to give him any credit but he has certainly ruined our lives. All she ever wanted to do was to be able to help people. People all over the world are now losers.' The station WPXI reported Lois Klein and her husband, William, are now caring for their 8-year-old granddaughter, Cianna, in Maryland. Ferrante, who has steadfastly denied poisoning his wife, is expected to file an appeal asking for a new trial. He declined an opportunity to speak in court after learning his fate. Heartbroken: Klein's mother, Lois (pictured in court February 4) said in a statement read during sentencing the murder had robbed her and her husband of their only child . Claims of innocence: Ferrante has steadfastly denied poisoning Klein and disputed whether that cyanide caused her death at all . On November 7, 2013, it took jurors 15 hours of deliberations spread over the course of two days to find the medical researcher guilty of first-degree murder. Klein and Ferrante's 8-year-old daughter is now being raised by her maternal grandparents . Allegheny County prosecutors successfully argued during Ferrante's high-profile trial that he deliberately laced his wife's creatine energy drink with cyanide he bought through his lab using a university-issued charge card two days before she fell suddenly ill in late April 2013. Dr Klein died three days later at University of Pittsburg Medical Center, despite doctors' efforts to save her. His lawyers made the case that she might not have been poisoned at all, citing three defense experts who said that couldn't be conclusively proved. Ferrante said the cyanide he bought was for stem cell experiments he was conducting on Lou Gehrig's disease, because the toxin can be used to kill of neurological cells and thus simulate the disease in the lab. But prosecutors said Ferrante was a ""master manipulator"" who concocted the plan to kill his wife after she pressured him to have a second child and because he may have feared she was having an affair or planned to divorce him. Ferrante did online searches on cyanide poisoning and how it might be removed by the medical treatments Klein received or detected by a coroner after her death.","A jury in November found former University of Pittsburgh researcher Robert Ferrante, 66, guilty of killing his wife, Autumn Klein .

Iranian authorities plan to sue Hollywood over its 'unrealistic portrayal' of the country, according to reports . Argo's portrayal of the escape of five hostages from Iran has been dismissed as 'CIA propaganda' The . decision on the lawsuit reportedly came after a group of Iranian cultural . officials and movie critics screened the film in a closed audience in a . Tehran cinema late last night. Argo, which won the Best Picture Oscar this year, tells the story of the escape of six American hostages from the besieged U.S Embassy in Tehran in 1979. The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance met for a one-day conference called 'The Hoax of Hollywood' on Monday night, according to the Tehran Times. It said the 'distortion of historical facts' in films including 300 and Argo prompted them to meet. Conference secretary Mohammad Lesani was quoted as saying: 'One of the main aims of the meeting is to unify all cultural communities in Iran against the attacks of the West, particularly Hollywood.' The website also reported that the conference intends to send a statement to the Human Rights Council on the matter.

A blindfolded American hostage is displayed to the crowd outside the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979. Iran is unhappy about the way the country was portrayed in Argo . Last month Iranian officials dismissed Argo as pro-CIA, anti-Iran propaganda and state television called it an 'advertisement for the CIA'. The semiofficial Mehr news agency called the Academy Award 'politically . motivated' because Michelle Obama helped present the award. Mohammed Hosseini, Iran's Culture Minister, described the film as a 'distorted history'. Argo has been banned from Iranian cinemas, but bootleg copies are believed to be available. Hundreds of Iranian students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran before taking dozens of staff hostage .

Five members of staff managed to escape by a side exit but the remaining 55 staff members were held captive for a further 444 days. The storming of the embassy was a result of mounting hostility against the U.S. after the exiled Shah of Iran was allowed to enter the America for cancer treatment . Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was installed and supported by both the U.S. and the UK governments but his rule was overthrown shortly after his exile in January 1979 and replaced with an Islamic republic.","Iranian media are reporting that authorities plan to sue Hollywood .

Amanda Taylor, 31, who was living in Vernal Utah, was whitewater rafting on the Arkansas River when she was tossed from the dinghy in the pitch black at around 10 pm when the boat missed a ramp and became stuck under a waterfall. He family rushed from their homes in Wyoming to help with the rescue and Taylor was discovered by her brother Beau Taylor only three miles from where she fell in. Drowning: Amanda Taylor (left and (right with her sister Brandy Taylor) passed away on Saturday in a rafting accident in Colorado . Family search: Amanda Taylor (pictured left with her sister, Ruby) was found by her brother, Beau, who stayed with her until search teams arrived . An autopsy performed on Thursday confirmed that she had tragically drowned when she and six others lost control of their raft in rapid waters. Five made it the shore and authorities rescued another 22-year-old man clinging to the raft. Undersheriff John Spezze said that search and rescue teams had scoured as far as 30 miles downstream and along the river's banks for Taylor, but the murkiness of the water made visibility difficult. The discovery of Amanda's body by her brother after four days of searching came after the involvement of five different local agencies. Amanda Taylor's brother spotted her body hanging on a branch close to the riverbank where the South Arkansas River meets the Arkansas River. Rafters navigate the whitewater rapids on the Arkansas River near Salida, Colorado: The search for a Utah woman who has been missing since her raft overturned Saturday night in the Arkansas River was called off on Thursday when Amanda Taylor's body found by her brother . He positively identified her when other search teams arrived and he and other family members held Taylor's body where it was found to stop it floating downstream according to The Mountain Mail. Bess said Taylor’s body must have recently floated down to where it was found after search teams had come through the area on rafts earlier. Other rafter's where much luckier than tragicTaylor.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A blast Monday near a political rally left 18 people dead in a Pakistan tribal region, a local government official said. The strike occurred in the Kurram district, Riaz Khan said, and also wounded at least 56 people. Khan said the blast was detonated remotely and 10 kilograms of explosives were used. The explosion occurred during a rally staged by the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal Ur Rehman group, a right-wing religious party with sympathies for the militant Taliban movement. The incident occurred as Pakistanis prepare to go to the polls Saturday for national elections. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility. It said it attacked because one of the candidates, Munir Orakzai, has handed over members of the mujahedeen to the United States. ""We will never forgive him nor leave him alive,"" a statement from Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ihsan Ullah Ihsan said. Jan Achakzai, a spokesman for Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal Ur Rehman, said more than 2,000 people were attending the rally. Dr. Anayatur Rehman, who works at the hospital that received the bodies, said 18 people died. Achakzai said more than 50 people were injured and two candidates received minor injuries. ""We will continue our politics of peace and reconciliation in Pakistan's tribal region despite these cowards' attacks,"" Achakzai said. Violence has marred the run-up to the elections. The anti-Taliban Awami National Party and the Muttahida Quami Movement and their personnel also have been targeted recently. Maulana Fazal Rahman, the head of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal Ur Rehman, condemned the attack and said it prompted him to underscore the importance of national unity and deplore sectarian hatred. ""We cannot replace Sunnis with Shias, nor Shias with Sunnis, but we can remove hatred between various sects, ethnicities, linguistic groups,"" he said.","NEW: Pakistani Taliban says it carried out the attack .

"A South Korean soldier who killed five members of his own unit was humiliated by comrades who drew pictures of him as SpongeBob SquarePants, according to military officials . A South Korean soldier who allegedly killed five members of his own unit was humiliated by comrades who drew pictures of him as SpongeBob SquarePants, according to military officials. The soldier, surnamed Yim, was detained last month after the incident at an army unit near the border with North Korea. He fled into the forest after the rampage, but was captured following a failed suicide attempt. Brig. Gen. Seon Jong-chul, from the army police, told reporters that Yim testified that he went on the killing spree after finding drawings on the back of his unit's border patrol log depicting him as the children's cartoon and another cartoon character. According to Seon, Yim said the drawings caused him to recall previous mockery and ignoring by fellow unit members. Yim told investigators he suffered lots of stress because of the drawings, Seon said. Defense Ministry officials said military prosecutors were planning to indict Yim. A massive manhunt was launched for Yim after the shooting. When he was tracked down troops  surrounded Yim in a forest about four miles from the border outpost and threw him a mobile phone so he could talk to his father. Yim's parents also used a loudspeaker to try to persuade him to surrender. Yim shot himself in the side of his abdomen but failed to kill himself and was taken to a nearby hospital . He shot himself in the side of his abdomen but failed to kill himself and was taken to a nearby hospital. Yim was due to complete his nearly two years of mandatory military service in September, according to defence officials. Initial personality tests last April put him within a group of soldiers who needed special attention and were unfit for frontline duty, a Defence Ministry official said. But tests last November concluded that he had improved and could serve in the frontline area. Shooting rampages against fellow soldiers occasionally happen in South Korea, which requires all able-bodied men to serve about two years because of a persistent threat from North Korea. In 2005, a soldier tossed a grenade and opened fire at a front-line army unit in a rampage that killed eight colleagues and injured several others. He later told investigators that he was enraged at superiors who had verbally abused him. A massive manhunt was launched for Yim after the shooting in June .

"(CNN)  -- A militant Islamist group associated with al Qaeda has for the first time threatened to attack Israel, far from its normal base of operations in Somalia. Al-Shabab, which is fighting to control the east African country, accused Israel of ""starting to destroy"" the Al Aqsa mosque, where standoffs have taken place recently between Israeli police and Palestinians. The mosque is part of the complex that Jews call the Temple Mount and Muslims call Haram al-Sharif. ""The Jews started to destroy parts of the holy mosque of Al Aqsa and they routinely kill our Palestinian brothers, so we are committed to defend our Palestinian brothers,"" said Mukhtar Robow Abu Mansur, a prominent Al-Shabab commander. His threat was part of a series of fiery sermons delivered after Friday prayers in Baidoa in southwest Somalia. Al-Shabab controls the region, which is part of a country that has been without an effective national government for nearly 20 years. Other leaders of the group also threatened Israel, the first time the group is known to have done so. ""We will transfer and expand our fighting in the Middle East so we can defend Al Aqsa mosque from the Israelis,"" Al-Shabab commander Abdifatah Aweys Abu Hamza said in Mogadishu, the Somali capital. He is apparently the leader of a new Al-Shabab armed group calling themselves ""Mujahedin Al Aqsa,"" or ""Al Aqsa Holy Warriors,"" which they said is assigned to attack Israel. It is not clear whether Al-Shabab has the capacity to carry out its threats against Israel. But Rashid Abdi of the International Crisis Group, speaking last week before al-Shabab issued its threats against Israel, warned that the group should be taken seriously. ""We should not underestimate the capacity of Al-Shabab,"" he said. ""This is a deadly organization, a formidable foe."" Abdi said the group had been mutating from a nationalist group into a terrorist organization more like al Qaeda, which was behind the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. ""If you look at the rhetoric and language and if you look at the Web sites, if you hear their preachers or their scholars speak, it is completely indistinguishable from al Qaeda leaders,"" Abdi said. The group has also become more vicious in Somalia, a local human rights expert said. ""The most gruesome and gross violations of human rights are committed by Al-Shabab,"" activist Hassan Shire Sheikh said. ""They have also instilled fear. They just shoot, they kill, they maim and they lash."" The group also threatened African neighbors on Friday, including Ethiopia, Djibouti, Kenya, Eritrea, Ghana, Sudan and Uganda. They have in the past threatened African nations that provide peacekeeping troops to the war-torn country. The U.S. State Department Country Reports on Terrorism from April lists Al-Shabab as a terrorist organization and blames it for shootings and suicide bombings inside Somalia. It does not list the group as having carried out violence outside Somalia, but says some members of the group have trained and fought alongside al Qaeda in Afghanistan. Somalia has been mired in chaos since 1991, when warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and sparked brutal clan infighting. The transitional government has struggled to establish authority, challenged by Islamist groups like Al-Shabab that have seized control of Mogadishu and much of the south. CNN's David McKenzie in Nairobi, Kenya, contributed to this report.","Al-Shabab accuses Israel of ""starting to destroy"" the Al Aqsa mosque .

"A father and his seven-month-old daughter have been found dead in their Michigan home after he failed to return the little girl to her mother amid a divorce battle. The bodies of Daryne Gailey, who had learning disabilities and suffered seizures, and his daughter Charley Lillian Hendrick were found in the Oakland County house by authorities carrying out a welfare check on Sunday morning. Charley, who was found in her crib, died from blunt force trauma to the head and her death was ruled a homicide. But authorities have not given a cause of death for her dad, who had a deep laceration from a boxcutter to his neck when he was discovered in the home's bathroom. Killed: The bodies of Daryne Gailey (right), who had learning disabilities, and his daughter Charley Lillian Hendrick (left) were found at his Michigan home on Sunday. Only her death has been ruled a homicide so far . Gailey's mother, 65-year-old Sylvia Majewska, was found on a couch inside the home with cuts to her body and was taken to hospital, where she remains, the Detroit Free Press reported. Since the deaths, it has emerged that Gailey had filed for divorce only six months after his August 2013 wedding to Charley's mother, Amanda Gailey. The divorce was finalized just three weeks ago. And more recently, Majewska had filed for a protection order on her son's behalf against his ex, although it was lifted in July, the Free Press reported. It is not clear why it was lifted. In the protection order, Majewska claimed that Amanda Gailey had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had kicked him in the groin and thrown a cell phone at him, according to court records. Battle: Gailey was looking after the girl following his divorce from his wife Amanda, left. His mother, Sylvia Majewska, right, who was also found hurt, had previously filed a protection order against Amanda . Happier times: The couple were married for just six months before Majewska sought to get their marriage annulled earlier this year, saying that her son did not have the cognitive abilities to marry . Gailey has denied the allegations. Majewska, who was her son's guardian due to his learning disabilities, sought to get her son's marriage annulled in January, saying he did not have the understanding to marry. The following month, the baby was born and Amanda Gailey was given full and legal custody of the baby girl. Daryne Gailey was allowed to see his daughter every other Friday with his mother present. The bodies were found on Sunday morning after Gailey failed to return the baby girl to her mother following the weekend visit. Authorities went to check on him and they discovered the bodies. A box cutter has been removed from the home as evidence, the Oakland County Sheriff's Office said. Killed: Authorities have not yet ruled the cause of Gailey's death, although he was found with a cut to his neck from a boxcutter. The medical examiner found little Charley died of blunt force trauma to the head . Sheriff's Sergeant Dale Brown said there didn't appear to be signs of forced entry into the home and no one has been charged in the incident. Deputies said it appeared to be a domestic incident, but would not provide further details, WXYZ reported. Gailey had worked as a clerk at a Kroger grocery store in Lake Orion for 15 years, employees said. They told the Free Press that he 'had a big heart'.","Daryne Gailey was found with a laceration to his neck from a boxcutter while his baby daughter, Charley, was killed by blunt force trauma to the head .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in northern Mexico detained a prison director and two other officials after 129 inmates escaped from the facility through a tunnel, officials said. The three prison leaders will be detained for 30 days during an investigation, Coahuila State Attorney General Homero Ramos told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. Local and federal authorities were searching for the inmates and U.S. officers were on alert after the prison break, which occurred Monday in Piedras Negras, across the border from Eagle Pass, Texas, and about 150 miles from San Antonio. The inmates escaped one by one from the minimum-security facility, slipping out through a 23-foot-long tunnel, cutting through a chain-link fence and running through an empty lot, according to a statement from the Coahuila state attorney general. The tunnel, which was about 4 feet wide and nearly 10 feet deep, began in a wood shop inside in the prison, authorities said. Officials originally said that 132 inmates had escaped but adjusted the figure to 129 after finding three inmates hiding in another part of the prison, state security spokesman Sergio Sisbeles said. Of the escapees, 86 were federal prisoners and 43 were incarcerated on local charges. The massive escape cast a fresh spotlight on an issue that has dogged Mexico's government in recent years: how to handle a growing prison population amid the country's crackdown on organized crime. Security analyst Javier Oliva said the prison break was the latest sign of a crisis that is intensifying. ""What guarantee do we have as a society that those who commit crimes in activities as serious as drug trafficking receive a corresponding punishment? This, beyond the accounts that there could be about this escape, is a very severe blow to the nation's mood,"" he said. Mexican President Felipe Calderon condemned the prison break in a series of Twitter posts Tuesday, calling it ""deplorable."" ""In the past six years more than 1,000 inmates have escaped from state prisons. From the federal prisons, not one,"" he wrote. The largest escape during Calderon's six-year term occurred in December 2010, when 151 inmates escaped from a local prison in the Mexican border city of Nuevo Laredo. In February, 30 inmates fled after a riot in a prison in Monterrey, Mexico. On Tuesday, Mexican authorities were offering a reward of nearly $16,000 for information leading to the capture of each escaped inmate. Local and federal authorities were searching for the inmates, and police have set up blockades on roads leading to the Mexico-U.S. border. U.S. Customs and Border Protection placed its officers and agents in the area on alert, a homeland security official said. ""At this point, CBP has no reports of escapees attempting to cross the border. We will continue coordinating with our Mexican counterparts as we monitor this situation,"" the source said. CNN en EspaÃ±ol's Mario Gonzalez and Rey Rodriguez and CNNMexico.com contributed to this report.","NEW: The prison break is a ""severe blow,"" a security analyst says .

A user posted a picture to Reddit showing a man at Monster Jam drinking a dark liquid out of a bottle before cracking open a can of Miller Lite. ''Murica! Monster Jam is worth the admission just for the people you get to see! Yes, that's a syrup bottle,' the user named Travis wrote. Sipping on...beer and syrup?

Low blood sugar: Someone sitting near the man reported him telling cops that he was drinking the syrup because of his diabetes . Put it away: The cop was fine with the syrup after figuring out there was no hard alcohol involved. But an event person told him no outside food or beverage was permitted and that his bottle would be taken away if he continued to drink it . The next image shows a police officer approaching the man in an orange cutoff shirt about the dark liquid.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Insurgents launched attacks Thursday on a Provincial Reconstruction Team base and a military outpost in Afghanistan, Afghan and NATO officials said. Three insurgents took positions in a home near a PRT base in Kandahar, said the region's police chief, Salim Ahsas. Officials killed two of the attackers, but one was ""still resisting in the building,"" Ahsas said. Residents reported heavy gunfire in the area. The PRT base is about 800 meters (half a mile) from the three-floor building the insurgents are in, said Haji Ahsan, acting head of the Kandahar Provincial Council. ""We can say that this a failed attack by the Taliban,"" Ahsan said. ""The Taliban have always been trying to do symbolic attacks to get more attention."" Haji Agha Lali, a member of the Kandahar provincial council, said insurgents were firing small guns and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) toward the Provincial Reconstruction Team. There were no casualties among PRT or military personnel, Ahsas said. The Taliban brought in two cars full of explosives, possibly to use in the attack, but authorities gained control of them and were working to defuse them, Ahsas said. The U.S. military describes PRTs as civil-military organizations aimed at helping improve stability and rebuild, usually following hostilities. The U.S. Embassy said the attack on the PRT base began at about 2:45 p.m. local time and was ongoing several hours later. Afghan and coalition forces responded. ""All PRT Chief of Mission personnel are safe and accounted for, but there are unconfirmed reports of a number of other injuries,"" the embassy said in a statement. ""We do not have additional details at this time."" The statement noted that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said civilians serving in Afghanistan will not be intimidated by such attacks. Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings, spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force, said the fighting in Kandahar was one of two incidents Thursday. The second involved a suicide car bomb that exploded outside an ISAF base in the Panjwai region. ""There are no ISAF casualties and the base's perimeter was not penetrated,"" he said.

"By . Ruth Styles . They have long been regarded as a nuisance in the garden but it seems that snails could be more friend than foe when it comes to anti-ageing. A revolutionary new facial that involves allowing live snails to slither across the complexion has been hailed the next big thing in beauty thanks to the glow-boosting properties of snail mucus. The mucus, which contains a mix of powerful proteins, antioxidants and hyularonic acid, is said to help skin retain moisture, soothe inflammation and remove dead skin. Scroll down for video . Slimy: Snails are applied to the face after cleansing during Japanese treatment, the Celebrity Escargot Course . Anti-ageing: Snail mucus contains a cocktail of youth-boosting ingredients including hyularonic acid . Effective: The new treatment is also believed to help tackle sun damage . During the 60-minute treatment, which is offered at the Clinical Salon in Tokyo, the face is cleansed before snails are placed on the cheeks and forehead and allowed to move around as they please. The facial, named the Celebrity Escargot Course, costs £161 and also includes a series of facial massages, masks and the use of an electrical pulse machine. 'Snail slime can help the recovery of skin cells on the face, so we expect the snail facial to help heal damaged skin,' Yoko Miniami, sales manager at Tokyo's Clinical Salon which offers the treatment, told the Sunday Telegraph. The substance is also believed to help tackle sun damage, according to Ms Miniami, who said: 'We are interested in the fact that snails have a function that can help heal skin damaged by ultraviolet rays.' According to Ms Miniami, the salon also uses creams infused with snail slime provided by the salon's five resident snails which are fed on organic vegetables, including carrots, spinach, Swiss chard and Japanese komatsuna greens. Disgusting though it might sound, snail slime isn't a recent addition to the anti-ageing arsenal and was first used more than 2000 years ago. According to records left by early doctor Hippocrates, crushed snails mixed with sour milk were used to treat skin inflammation, while more recently, products infused with mollusc slime have proved popular in Japan and South Korea. Despite the long history of snail slime as a beauty treatment, the Clinical Salon's effort was apparently inspired by Mount Fuji's recent elevation to UNESCO World Heritage status. Climbers are likely to suffer skin damage as they climb the peak, thanks to the thinner air and intense sunshine, and it is this the treatment is intended to fix.","Snail mucus is said to contain hyularonic acid, protein and antioxidants .

"(CNN) -- A flat tire saw Stéphane Peterhansel's lead in the Dakar Rally cut to seven and a half minutes by American Bobby Gordon who finished second behind stage eight winner Nani Roma. Peterhansel suffered a puncture 30km from the end of the stage between Copiapo and Antofagasta and saw his overall lead whittled down to seven minutes 36 seconds by Gordon. The American lost out to Roma, from Spain, by just five seconds and is still awaiting his first stage win in the 2012 rally. Defending champion Nasser Al-Attiyah, from Qatar, was disrupted by technical problems and had to stop on several occasions. He now trails Peterhansel by over 45 minutes. Pole Krzysztof Hołowczyc is third, 12 seconds behind Gordon and 7 minutes 48 secs behind the leader. Peterhansel is a Dakar legend with three car titles and six on motorbikes, all coming before the grueling endurance event moved to South America in 2009 but he didn't enjoy his best stage on Monday. He told the Dakar Rally's official website: ""I am losing loads of time. I drove quite slowly in the rocky parts because I was scared of punctures. And despite this... I had one 30 km from the finish. It was a bad special, but that is the way it is. ""Gordon started three minutes before us, and 180 kilometres from here we had got to 30 seconds behind him. I think that when he saw us he stepped it up, leaving us in the dust. ""He can win this thing, so it is essential for him to manage this situation as well as he can.""

Despres spent ten minutes trying to extricate himself from a patch of mud and cut a frustrated figure at the end of the stage. He said: ""There was a torrent of mud between the inspection of the reconnaissance car two days ago and today. Therefore, it did not appear in the road book and I was the first to fall into the trap. ""There was no way I could have avoided it. I am awaiting the organisers' decision: after Ullevalseter, Gonçalves and a few others had gone through, they took a detour, otherwise there would have been 200 vehicles trapped in the mud.

"By . John Stevens And Alan Roden . Scottish pensioners gain nearly £500-a-year by Scotland remaining in the Union, a study has found. The report by Gordon Brown reveals that retired Scots receive a better share of pensions and benefits than the rest of the UK. The former Labour Prime Minister argues that Scotland gets £9.6billion in pensions and old-age benefits annually, which is £500million more than the amount it would get if money was divided on the size on of its population. A study by Gordon Brown has revealed that retired Scots receive a better share of pensions and benefits than the rest of the UK . His intervention comes as a separate report by MPs warns that Alex Salmond’s proposal for workers to retire earlier in Scotland than in the rest of the UK was ‘almost entirely uncosted’. The study by the Scottish Affairs committee also accuses the Nationalist administration of ‘failing to acknowledge the costs and complexities of disentangling Scottish claimants from the UK welfare system’, and failing to explain how it would pay for shortfalls in public sector pension schemes. It will brand the SNP’s pensions policy as the ‘biggest mis-selling scandal in history’. Mr Salmond and his ministers have vowed to consider raising the state retirement age to 66 in a separate Scotland, rather than 67 as planned by the UK Government, because a lower life expectancy means pensioners receive between £10,000 and £11,000 less on average. Westminster has previously calculated that by 2030 the cost of such a policy would be as much as £800million-a-year with as many as 30,000 fewer people in work. Alex Salmond wants Scots to retire at 66 because they have a lower life expectancy than those in the rest of the UK . SNP ministers have also promised a state pension rise linked to whichever is highest - average wages, inflation, or 2.5 per cent. This so-called ‘triple lock’ will cost no more than the UK Government’s commitment to increase the state pension in line with earnings, they claim. But calculations by a major accountancy firms found that adopting the policy in an independent Scotland would cost £148million in 2019, rising to £272million in 2025. Scotland’s pensioner population is expected to rise from 1.04million in 2010 to 1.49million in 2066. But the working age population is only expected to increase from 3.3million to 3.6million. That will create a ‘dependency ratio’ of 2.41 workers for every pensioner, compared to 2.64 in other parts of the UK. Mr Salmond’s proposed solution is to lift restrictions on non-EU immigration if he wins the referendum, with net migration levels of 24,000-a-year – equivalent to a city the size of Edinburgh in around 20 years. But the committee’s report states: ‘Migration requires careful management, especially for its effects on public services, such as schools. Even the highest estimates of likely additional migration which we have seen… would be very challenging indeed to manage; and yet these levels are still not enough to address the affordability problems in relation to old age pensions which are thrown up by separation.’","Retired Scots receive a better share of pensions and benefits than the rest of the UK .

Asked if the crash could have been . avoided if Lehman Brothers – the investment bank which collapsed in 2008 . sparking the financial crisis – had been run by women, she said: ‘I do . believe women have different ways of taking risks ... of ruminating a . bit more before they jump to conclusions. ‘I think that as a result, particularly on the trading floor ... the approach would be different.’ Ms Lagarde also revealed how at the beginning of her career . she was told by one of France’s ‘most reputable’ firms that she would . never be made a partner because of her gender. She was told by the unnamed firm that she would be taken on, but should not ‘ever expect to make partnership’. When told this was ‘because you’re a woman’, she declined to take the job and found work elsewhere. Speaking to NPR, Ms LaGarde said that when she was a ‘baby lawyer’ applying for the best firms, one told her: ‘We’ll take you any time. You can join us tomorrow and be an associate, be given great tasks and great files and great clients to work on, but don’t ever expect to make partnership.’ She also talked about the IMF executive board, which has 24 men representing 188 countries on it. Ms Lagarde said that she was interviewed by 24 men and no women for her role at the firm because the only female director – who is soon to leave IMF and be replaced by another man – was away. ‘I can't do anything about it except talk about it — and complain about it when I talk about it — because those people are actually appointed by the various countries around the world that comprise the membership of the IMF,’ she said. ‘And it's very unfortunate because, not that these men are incompetent — they're very competent — but diversity is a richness and we're not having the benefit of that.’ Ms Lagarde was speaking shortly after . the release of an IMF study which found that half the women in the world . are not working, and that women are overexploited in work. Ms LaGarde was speaking shortly after the release of an IMF study which found that half the women in the world are not working, and that women are overexploited in work (stock picture) In the interview, she also highlighted the fact that the number of women in IMF management has doubled in the last ten years – although, she said, it is still ‘much too low’. Ms Lagarde said it was her intention to help build the number of women in middle management or upper-middle management at the firm, adding: ‘Where I perceive my role as making a difference is when I can encourage other women. ‘If I'm the single voice constantly in a room full of men, it's only going to carry the organization so far.’","Ms Lagarde said women had 'different ways of taking risks' than men .

"(CNN) -- The diminutive Derartu Tulu -- she stands only 1.56 meters (5 feet 2 inches) tall -- is one of, if not the greatest-ever female runners, the only woman ever to have won a long-distance gold at two separate Olympics. Two Olympic 10,000-meter victories have made Tulu an Ethiopian icon. Born, like so many great athletes, in the highlands of Ethiopia, a member of the Oromo tribe, she grew up tending cattle on the family farm, and was not even aware that she was an especially fast runner until she started taking part in athletics competitions in her teens. She won the World Junior 10,000 meters title in 1990, and at the 1991 World Championships in Tokyo, won her semifinal heat in an Ethiopian national record of 31 minutes 45.95 seconds. In the final, however, she came a disappointing eighth, leading many pundits to dismiss her chances of success at the following year's Barcelona Olympics. They couldn't have been more wrong. In one of the most thrilling 10,000-meter races of all time Tulu overtook South Africa's Elana Meyer just before the bell, running the final lap in 64 seconds to win by 30 meters, in the process becoming the first ever black African woman to win Olympic gold. The race over, she waited at the line for Meyer, a white south African, the two women embracing before joining hands and setting off on an emotional lap of honor together draped in their respective national flags, a gesture that seemed to symbolize hope for a new Africa. Defending her title four years later in Atlanta she could only manage fourth place. Triumphant return . At the 2000 Sydney Games, however, she made a triumphant return, overtaking her compatriot Gete Wami at the bell and sprinting the final 400 meters in an astounding 60 seconds to win in 30 minutes 17.49 seconds, a new African and Olympic record. Her victory made her the first woman ever to win two Olympic long-distance gold medals, and cemented her place as an Ethiopian national icon alongside fellow running legend Haile Gebreselassie (Addis Ababa city council subsequently named a school in her honor). In addition to her two Olympic titles Tulu has won a World Championship gold medal (2001), three World Cross Country titles and the London Marathon (2000). Although her mantle has, in recent years, passed to Britain's Paul Radcliffe, her place in the pantheon of athletic greats remains assured. She has a six year-old daughter, Tsion.","Olympic record: 2 gold medals .

However, this raging five-year -old tosses the stick to one side and opts for fist power as he punches the ever-smiling Mickey. Unfortunately for him, despite resorting to pummelling the Mickey Mouse container, he cannot break the piñata and the game is fruitless. The youngster resorts to pummeling the Mickey Mouse pinata with his fists as part of the Mexican  celebration . The traditional Catholic interpretation of the piñata is based on the struggle of man against temptation. The participant beats the sweet-filled piñata which represents evil, symbolising the struggle against temptation.

'Unexpected Stories reveals the . themes that would become Butler's lexicon: the complicating mysteries we . assign to power, race, and gender,' Mosley writes. 'Reading these tales . is like looking at a photograph of a child who you only knew as an . adult. In her eyes you can see the woman that you came to know much . later; a face, not yet fully formed, that contains the promise of . something that is now a part of you; the welcomed surprise of . recognition in innocent eyes,' he continued.

Butler's literary . agent, Merrilee Heifetz, found the stories, written in the early 1970s, . among the author's papers at the Huntington Library in San Marino, . California.

"(CNN) -- WBA world heavyweight champion David Haye has branded his IBF, WBO and IBO counterpart Wladimir Klitschko a ""robot"" and said the Ukrainian will ""malfunction"" in their unification bout in Hamburg on Saturday. Haye, 30, was talking at the final press conference ahead of the duo's highly-anticipated face-off, with tensions clearly running high between the two fighters. ""It's going to be fun to watch this big robot start malfunctioning,"" the London native told reporters. The pair were due to get in the ring in 2009, before Haye was forced to withdraw with a back injury, and the Englishman said he is happy the fight did not take place two years ago because he is now in much better shape. ""I'm healthy, my speed is ridiculous, punch power is there, and I'm just in a really good place,"" he said. ""I'm happy the fight's happening now and didn't happen a couple of years ago because I am so much more of a better fighter now."" Klitschko acknowledged his opponent was in fine physical condition, but the 1996 Olympic gold medal winner said Haye will be the 50th knockout victim of his professional career and that the experience will make him ""a better person."" ""I will knock your butt out back into reality, which is good for your future life,"" said Klitschko. ""You're going to become a better person, a better man, with better behavior and you'll be on time."" The Semey-born boxer was referring to the fact that Haye was 30 minutes late for the press conference, and Klitschko went on to say: ""He was late for half an hour today, we've all been waiting for you princess."" The tension rose further when Wladimir's brother Vitali, the WBC heavyweight champion, stood up and asked Haye whether he would be attending the post-fight press conference. ""Please, promise, in front of many journalists, that you're coming to the press conference after the fight?"" Haye responded: ""I'm coming for you [Vitali] after the fight, make sure you're there."" Vitali famously faced a British fighter in 2003, when he lost to Lennox Lewis by technical knockout after the end of the sixth round. Former world amateur championships silver medallist Haye has previously said he will retire before turning 31 in October, but ""The Hayemaker"" has also expressed a desire to defeat both Klitschko brothers before hanging up his gloves. British cruiserweight Carl Thompson defeated Haye in their fight in 2004, his only career loss in 26 professional clashes. Klitschko will be looking to avoid a fourth defeat of his pro career, having won 55 of his 58 bouts. The fight will take place at the Imtech Arena, home of Bundesliga football club Hamburg, on Saturday.","David Haye has branded Wladimir Klitschko a ""robot"" ahead of their fight on Saturday .

The son of a well-known Chinese general has gone on trial charged with taking part in a gang rape. Li Tianyi, 17, and four other men have denied taking part in the February incident at a Beijing hotel that followed a night of heavy drinking. Li is the son of Li Shuangjiang, one of China’s most famous military leaders, who has reportedly fallen ill as a result of his son’s arrest. On trial: Li Tianyi, 17, and four other men are charged with the gang rape of woman in a Beijing hotel . If convicted, the baby-faced teenager could serve from three to 10 years, although the law allows for harsher punishment if the case is considered especially serious. A group of . journalists awaited Li and his four co-defendants as they were driven . through the gate of Beijing's Haidian District Court. The case is not . open to the public because Li is a minor. His . father Li Shuangjiang is a general famed for singing patriotic anthems . for the People's Liberation Army and often stars in television galas. Father and son: Li Tianyi (right) is son of Li Shuangjiang (left), a general in the Chinese army who is famed for singing Chinese patriotic anthems . Li Tianyi's mother Meng Ge arrives at the court in Beijing yesterday where her son is accused of taking part in a gang rape . He . was reportedly taken ill after his son was arrested, and was further . shamed when evidence emerged that he may have lied about his son’s age . to give him a lenient sentence. Spoiled: Li Shuangjiang, was forced to make a public apology for failing to check his son's bad behavior . The . rape charges aren't the younger Li's first brush with the law. He was . sentenced to a year in detention in 2011 as a 15-year-old for attacking a . couple over a minor traffic dispute and threatening onlookers, in a . case that attracted widespread condemnation online. He sent to a detention centre for a year after being convicted of assaulting a couple in the street who blocked the path of the BMW he was driving. Li was ridiculed in the media as a spoiled brat and his father was forced to make a public apology for failing to check his son's bad behavior. A video has emerged, published by South China Morning Post, showing General Li referring to his 12 year old son in 2006, meaning his son is now 19 and should then possibly have been tried as an adult in the 2010 incident. Amid anger over corruption and a widening wealth gap, many Chinese have become increasingly impatient with the antics of the ‘wealthy second generation’ seen as using their parents' money and connections to avoid repercussions for illegal or outrageous behavior.","Li Tianyi, 17, and four others stand accused of rape .

"Leicester climbed to fifth place in the Aviva Premiership standings after beating bottom club London Welsh 26-5 at the Kassam Stadium. The Tigers took an age to quell the spirited Welsh, who kept the visitors to a 5-5 score line after 35 minutes before Leicester's forward power told after the interval. Harry Thacker scored two tries for the visitors, Graham Kitchener and replacement Robert Barbieri the others with Tommy Bell kicking three conversions. Bell had taken over the kicking from Freddie Burns, who had a poor match, missing all three kicks and taking a number of wrong options before being substituted. Jamie Gibson breaks through a London Welsh tackle as Leicester showed enough strength to win . London Welsh, buoyed by an impressive effort from their new recruit, number eight Opeti Fonua, gave a much improved show with their defence considerably toughened after conceding more than 70 points at Wasps. However they did suffer a major blow when Fonua was helped off late in the second half. Leicester gave Bell a Premiership debut at full-back whilst wing Adam Thompstone was selected for his first Premiership start of the season. The pack was unchanged from last week's home draw with Saracens but Burns returned at fly-half. Welsh were without forwards Pablo Henn and Chris Hala'ufia who were both injured in last weekend's crushing defeat at Wasps. Ricky Reeves and Fonua were their replacements with veteran Gordon Ross selected at outside half in place of Will Robinson. Seb Jewell goes on the attack as London Welsh put in a much-improved display at the Kassam Stadium . Ross began with a careless error, kicking the ball straight into touch to concede a line-out in the home 22. Welsh were then penalised but the Tigers elected an attacking line-out before a knock-on enabled the hosts to clear the danger. Burns had the game's first chance for points but his long range penalty sailed wide as Leicester made a whole host of mistakes in the first 15 minutes. Welsh were unable to get out of their half in the opening quarter but another missed penalty from Burns ensured that the match remained scoreless after 20 minutes. The errors continued in abundance with Burns' charged down kick the latest, which gave Welsh their first chance of points but Tom May's drop goal attempt went wide. However, Welsh surprisingly took the lead with Seb Jewell being the catalyst for the score. The full back first retrieved his high kick ahead and when the ball was recycled, skilfully placed a cross-field kick directly into the path of Scott, who easily collected for the try. Graham Kitchener dives over the line as the Leicester pack began to dominate in the second half . After the two misses from Burns, Leicester opted for an attacking line-out after being awarded another penalty. This time it paid dividends with Thacker crashing over for the try with Burns again off target with the kick. Welsh nearly regained the lead when Lachlan McCaffrey charged down a clearance kick and looked set to score, only for Burns to race back and narrowly beat the flanker to the touchdown. However, back came Leicester to secure another attacking line-out for Thacker to score his second. Bell took over the kicking duties and succeeded from the touchline to give Tigers a 12-5 interval lead. Tommy Bell took over the kicking responsibilities after Freddie Burns had missed his first three efforts . Leicester dominated the opening period of the second half and deservedly went further ahead when Kitchener brushed aside two tacklers to score for Bell to convert. With 20 minutes remaining, Burns was replaced by Owen Williams and he was in time to see Barbieri finish off another line-out drive for the bonus point try. Welsh lost Fonua through injury after he had attempted to force his way over before a thoroughly disappointing game meandered to a tame conclusion.","Bottom side London Welsh have lost every game so far this season .

"Schoolbook authors have been told not to write about sausages or pigs for fear of causing offence. Guidance from leading educational publisher the Oxford University Press prohibits authors from including anything that could be perceived as pork-related in their books. The bizarre clampdown, apparently aimed at avoiding offence among Jews and Muslims, emerged yesterday during a discussion about free speech on Radio 4’s Today programme. It was immediately branded ‘nonsensical political correctness’. Scroll down for video . Oxford University Press bans authors from including  pork-related material in their books, so stories about sausages (left), pigs (centre) and bacon (right) are prohibited . Presenter Jim Naughtie – whose writer wife Eleanor Updale is in talks with Oxford University Press (OUP) over an educational book series – said: ‘I've got a letter here that was sent out by OUP to an author doing something for young people. ‘Among the things prohibited in the text that was commissioned by OUP was the following: Pigs plus sausages, or anything else which could be perceived as pork. ‘Now, if a respectable publisher, tied to an academic institution, is saying you've got to write a book in which you cannot mention pigs because some people might be offended, it’s just ludicrous. It is just a joke.' Muslim Labour MP Khalid Mahmood said: ‘I absolutely agree. That’s absolute utter nonsense. And when people go too far, that brings the whole discussion into disrepute.’ The OUP says its guidelines exist because it needs to make its educational material available to as many people as possible. Muslim Labour MP Khalid Mahmood called the ban on pork-related content 'absolute utter nonsense' A spokesman said: ‘Many of the educational materials we publish in the UK are sold in more than 150 countries, and as such they need to consider a range of cultural differences and sensitivities. 'Our editorial guidelines are intended to help ensure that the resources that we produce can be disseminated to the widest possible audience.’ But last night the publishing rules were ridiculed amid doubts either Muslims or Jews would be offended by mention of farm animals in a children’s book. Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘How on earth can anyone find the word “pig” or “pork” offensive? 'No word is offensive. It is the context in which it is used that is offensive.’ He added: ‘On the one hand you have politicians and the great and the good falling over each other to say how much they believe in freedom of speech and on the other hand they are presiding over people being unable to use and write words that are completely inoffensive. 'We have got to get a grip on this nonsensical political correctness. ‘The political correctness brigade appear to have taken control of our schools. 'The Secretary of State needs to get a grip over this and make sure this ridiculous ban is stopped at once.’ He added that perhaps one good thing to come out of the Paris terror attacks was a groundswell of support for freedom of speech. The chief executive of campaigning group Index on Censorship, Jodie Ginsberg, said: ‘It is difficult to imagine any context in which images of everyday objects – like pigs – or the word itself should be banned from being used in a children’s book.’ A spokesman for the Jewish Leadership Council added: ‘Jewish law prohibits eating pork, not the mention of the word, or the animal from which it derives. Authors following the Oxford guidelines would not be able to mention characters from Peppa Pig (pictured)","Ban is apparently aimed at avoiding offence among Jews and Muslims .

"Asuncion, Paraguay (CNN) -- Paraguay installed new top military commanders, but President Fernando Lugo, who had ordered the change in leadership, was not present for the ceremony. Lugo's absence Thursday morning attracted attention given his administration's silence on the sudden change in the leadership of the country's army, air force and navy. The president's decision to replace the top brass came a day after he publicly dismissed rumors about a military coup. Brig. Gen. Bartolome Ramon Pineda Ortiz was named as the new army commander. Brig. Gen. Hugo Gilberto Aranda Chamorro and Rear Adm. Egberto Emerito Orie Benegas took over the top posts at the air force and navy, respectively. The announcement came from the armed forces, not the president's office. Cibar Benitez, commander of the armed forces, was the only top leader to retain his post. Other changes would be forthcoming in the lower ranks, said Benitez at the swearing-in ceremony, but he denied there was any truth to talk of a coup. Paraguay's history is filled with unstable transitions of power since it emerged from dictatorship in 1989. Although there hasn't been a coup since that year, there were attempted coups in 1996 and 2000, and President Raul Cubas resigned amid controversy in 1999. The military shakeup is the third since Lugo took office. The former Catholic bishop was elected to a five-year term last year. His victory brought an end to six decades of one-party rule in Paraguay, but the honeymoon did not last long. In April, Lugo admitted that he fathered a child while he was still a priest and that he may have fathered more. The revelation, which came as a shock to most, hurt his political image. Calls for his resignation began, and have continued as Lugo has struggled to push reforms through a majority-opposition legislature. Journalist Sanie Lopez Garelli contributed to this report.","Other changes forthcoming in lower ranks, says commander of armed forces .

That led to the introduction of Europe in 1979 and proved the catalyst for The Ryder Cup's current standing in the game. 'Both organisations would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the vision of one man who, in 1977, recommended to the President of the PGA of America and our President of the British PGA to consider widening the British and Ireland team to all of Europe,' O'Grady added. 'You have seen what the match has become now, with nine nationalities represented this week. To recognise this on a course designed by Jack Nicklaus couldn't be a more fitting occasion.' Ted Bishop, President of the PGA of America, said: 'On behalf of the PGA of America and our colleagues from Ryder Cup Europe, we are honoured to be part of this recognition of Jack Nicklaus - the game's all-time Major champion - who forever will be linked to the success of The Ryder Cup. 'Jack's efforts to expand The Ryder Cup to involve Europe not only elevated the competition, but ensured its future. In the process, his efforts also resulted in The Ryder Cup being able to benefit multiple charitable organisations on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.'

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- With every click of his camera, Japanese photographer and activist Shuuichi Endou hopes to draw attention to the plight of Tuvalu, a remote nation of people whose home is slowly disappearing. Tuvalu is the world's fourth smallest country behind Vatican City, Monaco and Pacific Ocean neighbor Nauru. He's taking 10,000 photos, one of each person who lives there, to show the world the human face of climate change. ""Tuvaluans do not ask much, neither goods nor money,"" he says. ""In Japan, people sacrifice their time and life to get more goods and money. I hope the viewers see the contrast by looking at the photos. We're sacrificing peaceful Tuvalu."" At first glance, Tuvalu is an island paradise, 26 square kilometers of white sand and lush foliage in the Pacific Ocean, north of Fiji. But the sea level is rising, so much so that the nation's water has become too salty to drink and to grow vegetables, especially taro, a vegetable that was once the island's staple food. ""As they don't have water and food, they began to import food from overseas, says Endou, who set up the NGO Tuvalu Overview to highlight their cause. ""As they began to import, their consumption has been increasing. As a result, more and more products began to be imported. This changed Tuvaluans' diet and increased the amount of waste."" A global appeal . Tuvalu's government considers the situation so urgent it has allocated some of the nation's meager budget to pay for its own permanent ambassador to the United Nations in New York. Afelee Pita took up the job in December 2006 and within months had given perhaps the most important speech ever made by a Tuvaluan: an address to a Special Session of the United Nations Security Council on Energy, Climate and Security. ""That was my very first statement that I issued and it was also a challenging one because it had never been done before, particularly at that level at the Security Council,"" Pita says. He told the assembled dignitaries: ""The world has moved from a global threat once called the Cold War, to what now should be considered the 'Warming War'. Our conflict is not with guns and missiles but with weapons from everyday lives -- chimney stacks and exhaust pipes."" click here for the full speech . New York is a long way from home for the native Tuvaluan. Back on the island he'd be more likely to go for an early morning canoe ride than negotiate thousands of commuters on the subway. ""Living in New York is totally different compared to where we come from. Life is not that easy of course. You have so many strangers. At home, you know everybody [and] whatever you do everybody knows,"" he laughs. Securing a future . While he'd much rather be at home -- ""Definitely there's nothing like home"" -- Pita feels that his time in New York is vital in helping to secure the future of the islands. ""My ultimate objective is to contribute as much as I can in terms of trying to establish relations with as many member states in the UN as possible, and more importantly to secure some sort of commitment from the international community in terms of development projects and any kind of assistance they can provide to us."" The Tuvalu nation wants to invest in renewable energy projects, to reduce the island's own reliance on fossil fuels for energy. ""Sometimes you have to clean your own house first before you look outside,"" Pita says. In English, Tuvalu means ""eight standing together"". On the issue of climate change, Tuvalu hopes the world will stand together with them. ""To me it's not an easy issue to solve, particularly in terms of trying to get the commitment of rich countries,"" Pita says. ""I can, of course, understand their reasoning and how they look at the issue but I think what we need to do is to continue raising our concerns and hopefully one day the community will listen and try to commit something.""","Pacific nation Tuvalu feeling the effects of climate change, sea level rising fast .

"By . Carol Driver . Compensation: Oliver Keynes with his passport and the stamps Royal Mail offered . A holidaymaker whose passport was lost in the post by Royal Mail has been offered six stamps in compensation - despite the ordeal costing him £500. Oliver Keynes was forced to cut his three-week trip to India to nine days due to the loss of his ID, which was sent to Trailfinders as part of a visa application. Mr Keynes, from Bristol, said he had used Royal Mail's special delivery service to send his passport in the post, but when the travel company opened the envelope, nothing was inside. The delay . forced Mr Keynes to reduce the length of his trip - and he also had to . pay out for a replacement passport, and spend another £500 on a new . flight to India. However, when he approached Royal Mail for compensation, the organisation offered him six stamps by way of an apology. Mr Keynes told the BBC: ‘I was asking for a refund of the costs that I've had to spend as a result of having my passport stolen. ‘I'd also . like, if not an apology, then a little bit of feeling like I've been . treated with respect for something that was nothing to do with me.’ The letter Mr Keynes received apologised for the missing item of mail. However, it said the firm had taken the 'following action', which included enclosing a book of stamps 'as compensation for the loss'. Royal Mail has now offered to reimburse Mr Keynes for the passport costs. Compensation: A paragraph of the letter Mr Keynes received from Royal Mail states what the firm would offer .

"The sale of alcohol has been banned in Broome after a woman was run over by a police car on Saturday night when police attended an alcohol-fueled brawl involving over 150 men. Police arrived at the Town Beach park in Broome after being alerted to the large group of locals drunkenly fighting at the popular picnic spot just after 4pm. The woman was allegedly lying on the ground and intoxicated, when an officer attempted to drive the police van forward in an effort to aid his colleagues contain the brawl and ran over her. Police arrived at the Town Beach park in Broome after being alerted to the large group of locals drunkenly fighting at the popular picnic spot just after 4pm . Kimberley District Superintendent Mick Sutherland said that those in the area were 'already fighting among themselves,' reported The West Australian. The woman has been taken to the Royal Perth Hospital hospital with six broken ribs and a fractured wrist, but her injuries are reported to not be life-threatening. Broome Liquor Accord has banned the sale of take-away alcohol in a voluntary motion, and Superintendent Sutherland said that the local police would continue a zero-tolerance approach to street drinking. Officers were reportedly afraid for their safety, with one officer punched in the head and neck and another hit in the face. Superintendent Sutherland said that enough was enough, and that Indigenous leaders needed to take responsibility for relaying the message to their community before someone was killed. 'An officer attempted to arrest one of the males and handcuff him, when the group surrounded police and set upon officers,' said Superintendent Sutherland. 'Indigenous leaders and elders need to get a very important message back to their people to behave themselves before someone is killed.' 'We will have to take two police vehicles off the road and replace them with two vehicles from remote communities, which will have to go without patrols.' 'This is the knock-on effect. These people are the first to contact us when they are in trouble, yet they attack our officers and equipment that are needed to keep people safe.' Police vehicles also suffered attacks, with many of the van windows broken and several panels kicked in. Four people were charged with offences including assaulting police, criminal damage and escaping legal custody. In September this year police attended to a drunken post-match brawl involving 300 people, during which police and local houses were pelted with glass bottles. The large fight also prompted a temporary ban on the sale of alcohol, with local community members expressing outrage over the violence, reported The ABC.","Police arrived at Town Beach park in Broome after being alerted to a drunken brawl which had erupted involving 150 people .

"By . Amanda Williams . A pet dog called WKD was discovered so badly starved and neglected that it could barely stand, a court has heard. The dog's desperate state was only discovered when it went into another property, where a neighbour was so appalled and concerned by the dog's weak and emaciated state that he immediately called for animal protection officers. Owner Neil Urquhart, 43, has now been banned from owning dogs for five years after it was found that he failed to properly feed or exercise the female greyhound-cross. A pet dog called WKD was discovered so badly starved and neglected by its owner that it could barely stand, a court has heard . The SSPCA, which brought the prosecution at  at Dingwall Sheriff Court, said the dog's emaciated condition was 'entirely preventable'. Urquhart, of Cromarty, Ross-shire admitted being responsible for the black female greyhound-cross dog between September and December 2013 when he caused it unnecessary suffering by failing to provide nutrition, and basic grooming causing its nails to be overgrown. Depute fiscal Stewart Maciver said the dog was so emaciated it was unsteady on its feet. Mr Maciver said the dog went on to a neighbour’s property and he was concerned because the dog was so thin and weak and its nails were curling. He fed the dog before contacting the animal welfare charity. The fiscal said when the dog was taken into care by the SSPCA it weighed 7.8kgs and by February, after proper care and feeding, it had made a good recovery and weighed 12 kgs. Mr Maciver said the dog’s name was WKD. 'That may or may not be after an alcoholic refreshment of the same name,' he said. Urquhart signed the dog over to the ownership of the SSPCA on December 27. The fiscal said it was a black and white female bitch, and it looked like a greyhound but was cross-bred. Mr Maciver said when the SSPCA inspectors spoke to Urquhart he told them it had been his wife’s dog. She had taken it to a vet and had been told the weight loss was due to a liver infection. The SSPCA, which brought the prosecution at at Dingwall Sheriff Court, said the dog's emaciated condition was 'entirely preventable' Owner Neil Urquhart, 43, has now been banned from owning dogs for five years after it was found that he failed to properly feed or exercise the female greyhound-cross . 'The SSPCA went to the vet and there was no record of this visit,' he added. 'Blood tests were taken by the SSPCA and there was no evidence of infection. 'It was simply a case of the dog not having been properly fed or exercised.' Urquhart, who is unemployed and represented himself in court, told the court he had no other animals but he had signed another dog over to the SSPCA. He said the greyhound belonged to his wife but they separated. She was not allowed to keep the dog on her property and his life had taken a downward spiral, he said. He had no plans to keep a dog and did not oppose a banning order. Sheriff Andrew Miller told him: 'This is a serious offence. Up and down the country the lives of people are enriched by pets and it’s important that anyone who brings an animal into their home looks after it. Urquhart, who is unemployed and represented himself at Dingwall Sheriff Court House, told the court he had no other animals but he had signed another dog over to the SSPCA . 'In this case there was a significant failing to provide this dog with the absolute basic level of care and feeding and this is shown in these very unpleasant photographs before the court.' He fined Urquhart £200 as well as imposing a five-year ban from owning dogs under the Animal Welfare Scotland Act. Commenting on the investigation, Scottish SPCA Senior Inspector Andy Brown said: 'WKD was emaciated and very unsteady on her feet when we found her. 'We’re pleased Urquhart was given a five-year ban as the condition of the dog was entirely preventable and could easily have been avoided if she had been given the proper care she needed. 'Thankfully, WKD made an excellent recovery in our care and we have since found her the loving home she deserves.'

"By . Leon Watson . PUBLISHED: . 15:45 EST, 16 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:35 EST, 16 January 2013 . Murder victim Rachel Manning, who was found dumped near a golf course in Milton Keynes . A restaurant worker was responsible for strangling a teenage girl and dumping her body 12 years ago, a jury heard today. Shahidul Ahmed, 41, murdered shop assistant Rachel Manning, 18, after she made a late night call from a public phone box in Milton Keynes, then drove her body to a golf course where he left it in the undergrowth, it is alleged. After killing her he disfigured her face with a car steering lock, it is claimed. Today, Ahmed, of Bletchley, . Buckinghamshire, went on trial for the murder, which was alleged to have . happened on Sunday December 10, 2000. The Bangladesh-born defendant denies . the charge. Russell Gumpert, prosecuting, said DNA found on the steering . lock matched the accused's. The lock was discovered by the road . 'on the direct route between the spot where the body was hidden and . Shahidul Ahmed's home in Bletchley'. Luton Crown Court also heard Ahmed sold his . car eight days after Miss Manning, who had been to a fancy dress party . then a nightclub, was murdered. The jury of seven women and five men . heard that Ahmed came to police attention in May 2010 when he was . arrested for an unrelated matter. It was at this point officers matched . his DNA to the unsolved murder, the jury was told. Mr Gumpert said the . victim was strangled with a soft ligature. 'Her body was deposited in the . undergrowth at Woburn Golf Club about eight miles from the centre of . Milton Keynes,' said the barrister. 'The prosecution case is that she was . murdered by Shahidul Ahmed and that he attacked her close to a telephone . box in Milton Keynes from which she had just made a call, before . driving her body to the golf club and disposing of it. 'There is no evidence which points to . any particular motive, although it seems likely that the impulse to . attack her would have been a sexual one. 'Whether he always intended to kill her, or only did so because she was not willing to comply with his demands is unknown.' Bangladesh-born Shahidul Ahmed, 41, is on trial at Luton Crown Court for murder . Miss Manning's boyfriend Barri White was convicted of her murder in 2002. His conviction was later quashed on appeal and he was acquitted at a retrial in 2008. Miss Manning had been to a 70s' theme party with Mr White and her friends on Saturday December 9, 2000. They went on to Chicago's nightclub and left at about 2.15am, with Mr White walking to stay at a friend, Keith Hyatt's, home. Miss Manning walked off alone, to catch a taxi. She phoned her home in Wolverton from the phone box at 2.43am and spoke to her flatmate to say she was upset. The flatmate, Chris Gardiner, phoned her back but the call failed. She then phoned Mr White and said she did not know where she was. The pair, who had been drinking, agreed to meet at a Blockbuster video store and he and Mr Hyatt would pick her up. When they arrived at 3.13am in Mr Hyatt's white van she was not there. The prosecutor said it was likely that she was already dead. Mr White went out again later on foot and called to see her at work the next day. When he heard she had not shown up he alerted the police.","Shahidul Ahmed, 41, accused of murdering Rachel Manning, 18 .

"Police forces are stuck in a time warp, using out-of-date methods to deal with modern offences in substandard investigations, a report claimed yesterday. Inspectors found that only one in four crimes are being solved by police. A watchdog also said victims are routinely let down, as nearly half of the country’s police aren’t good enough at investigating crime. Yesterday Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) published a 243-page audit giving forces an Ofsted-style rating for the very first time. They were ranked as outstanding, good, requires improvement or inadequate in key performance areas including preventing and investigating crime, providing value for money and operating fairly. Detectives are failing to carry out house-to-house inquiries, take photos of injuries in domestic abuse cases and collect CCTV evidence on violent attacks, today's report revealed . The assessment revealed that police are failing to get to grips with cyber crime, child sexual exploitation and crimes against the vulnerable and elderly. Inspectors were also concerned about the ‘erosion’ of officers’ basic investigative skills in relation to crimes such as burglary and assault. A total of 18 out of 43 forces in England and Wales serving 28million people – nearly half of the UK’s population – need to improve their investigations, the report claimed. These include some of our biggest forces, with officers in London, Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield said to lack vital skills and experience. In the 18 underperforming forces, detectives sometimes failed to properly gather evidence from CCTV footage, take fingerprints, identify suspects and support victims. There were also problems exposed in the way forces deal with domestic abuse and violent crimes, with detectives not carrying out basic house-to-house inquiries or taking photographs of injuries. In other cases, investigation plans had been ‘cut and pasted’ from previous jobs. The shocking findings come just a week after the HMIC criticised forces for ‘indefensible’ failures in crime recording which see almost a million offences a year disappearing from official figures. Tom Winsor, the chief inspector, said ‘sluggish’ police had fallen ‘behind the curve of rapidly changing criminality’ because they were not recruiting the right people. He added: ‘The police in too many respects are policing many crimes of today with the methods of yesterday. ‘In the past the police recruited 18-year-old men to deal with burglaries and with street violence. ‘The kind of police officer needed today is much more tech-savvy and more sympathetic, with a wider range of skills – and yet today we are seeing the police predominantly policing yesterday’s crimes with yesterday’s methods and kit.’ Home Secretary Theresa May (left) is under pressure to improve police investigations following today's report by the Chief Inspector of Constabulary Tom Winsor (right) Mr Winsor said top officers should take the blame for their forces being ‘insufficiently prepared for the crimes of the future’. And the report went on to warn that as a result of cuts, officer numbers will fall to their lowest for a decade, predicting: ‘The already thin blue line in our communities is narrowing still further.’ Steve White, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: ‘We have been warning there are issues around what the service can provide against cuts to funding and police numbers. ‘Although we are pleased that the majority of forces are performing well, we know that officers are struggling to provide the service they believe the public deserve.’","Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary said victims  being let down .

Reforms to the formula used to ration expensive medicines will make it harder for NHS patients to get new life-saving drugs, warn campaigners. The rationing body, The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), plans to lower the cost threshold for new treatments and end the priority given to patients who are dying. The reforms are a shift to a system which the Government pledged would allow patients to ‘access the drugs and treatments their doctors think they need’. It involves changes to a complex formula, known as quality adjusted life years (QALY). Reforms to the formula used to ration expensive medicines will make it harder for NHS patients to get new life-saving drugs, warn campaigners . NICE chief executive Andrew Dillon said the rationing body would exceed the new £20,000 limit in exceptional circumstances . This determines the cost-effectiveness of a treatment by working out how it extends a life compared with existing treatments. Treatments have previously been approved if the cost is below £20,000, but may also get the go-ahead if they fall between £20,000 and £30,000. The proposals delete the £30,000 upper limit – which means many drugs currently approved, such as the breast cancer treatment Herceptin, would have had a slim chance of getting a green light from NICE if applying in future. And some drugs approved under ‘end of life criteria’ – ones which might extend a dying patient’s life by precious weeks or months – will also face a tough battle. Andrew Wilson, of the Rarer Cancers . Foundation, said: ‘Far from making it easier for patients to get the . latest cancer drugs, these changes set the bar even higher.’ NICE chief executive Andrew Dillon said the rationing body would exceed the new £20,000 limit in exceptional circumstances. He . added: ‘We are not going to restrict further the availability of drugs. If companies offer prices that really reflect the value their . treatments bring, it holds open the prospect for us to say yes more . often.’","Reforms to the formula used to ration expensive medicines will make it harder for patients to get new life-saving drugs, campaigners say .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . It's common knowledge that medication can cause unwanted side effects, from headaches to rashes and cramps. But one woman got more than she bargained for when trying to ease her symptoms of Parkinson's - up to five spontaneous orgasms a day. The 42-year-old had been diagnosed with an early-onset form of the disease,  triggered by a lack of the chemical dopamine in the brain. Seven days after being prescribed the drug rasagiline, the woman began suffering hyperarousal . Like many Parkinson's patients, she was prescribed the drug rasagiline which increases dopamine levels, therefore helping to relieve symptoms such as tremor, stiffness and slow movement. Well-known side effects include headache, flu-like symptoms, feeling dizzy, constipation and dry mouth. But after seven days, the Turkish woman began experiencing rather more unusual ones - hyperarousal and increased libido, LiveScience reports. This was triggering three to five orgasms a day, lasting between five and 20 seconds each time. By the 10th day, the woman was so distressed, she was admitted to hospital. In a case report, to be published in the journal Parkinsonism and Related Disorders, the doctors who treated her wrote: 'To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of this adverse effect of rasagiline.' Why the spontaneous orgasms occurred isn't clear - but one theory is the raised levels of dopamine that rasagiline causes . The woman had not been taking any other medication, and she did . not experience any other bizarre symptoms related to the use of the . drug, according to the report from the medics at the department of neurology at Necmettin Erbakan University in Konya, Turkey. When she stopped taking the drug, the symptoms stopped. But the orgasms began again 15 days later when she resumed the course, forcing her to  abandon it. It's not clear why the spontaneous orgasms occurred - but one theory is the raised levels of dopamine that rasagiline causes. This is because dopamine is a neurotransmitter that activates the body's reaction to sexual pleasure, the researchers say. In their case report, they mention another bizarre case concerning the drug - a man who suffered from spontaneous ejaculation. The episodes continued even when the dose of rasagiline dropped by half, but stopped when the 65-year-old ceased taking the drug. He also reported a better sex life when he did want to have intercourse, according to the report in the journal Movement Disorders.","42-year-old Turkish woman had been prescribed the drug rasagiline .

"By . Rob Davies, City Correspondent . Over-50s’ group Saga is ready for a mass scramble to buy shares in its stock market float, after one in three of its customers said they want to invest. Saga, which specialises in insurance, holidays and home healthcare, is giving customers and employees priority in the rush to buy stock in a deal set to value the business at £3billion in total. Investors will also receive one free share for every 20 they buy, so those who buy £1,000 of shares will get £50 worth at no extra cost. The over-50s group specialises in insurance and holidsy. Pictued is the company's cruise ship, the Saga Sapphire . The float could prove even more popular than the part-privatisation of the Royal Mail, after more than 700,000 of Saga’s 2.1million customers, or one in three, expressed an interest in buying shares. Customers will have to sign up for a minimum £1,000 of stock to be eligible, while 20,000 employees can apply for a minimum of £500. That suggests Saga could face a clamour for £710million of stock, far out-stripping the £550million that it plans to sell. If demand exceeds supply, customers and staff will get less than they applied for because a portion of shares will be reserved for ordinary investors and financial institutions in the City of London. But sources close to the deal said executive chairman Andrew Goodsell was determined that big City firms would not snap up shares at the expense of private individuals. Sir Andrew Goodsell, executive chairman of Saga executive chairman Andrew Goodsell, who it is said wanted private individuals the chance to snap up shares . The Government’s float of the Royal Mail was heavily criticised over the amount of shares earmarked for City firms, which sold them for a quick profit while thousands of small investors missed out. Saga, which began life as a small hotel in Folkestone, Kent, said ensuring that its customers get shares was part of the company’s ethos. For customers to be eligible for priority status, they have to have bought a product from Saga within a certain timeframe. ‘Our customers are at the heart of our brand and I am delighted that they will have an opportunity to become shareholders in the company and to be part of the next stage of our journey,’ said executive chairman Andrew Goodsell. Anyone who has bought a financial product, a Saga magazine subscription or a private healthcare between January 5, 2013, and yesterday will be eligible. Those who booked a Saga or Titan holiday or cruise, including anyone who travelled with them, will be eligible as long as they booked between January 5, 2011, and yesterday. Saga is being sold by private equity groups CVC, Permira and Charterhouse. The trio bought Saga for £1.3billion in 2004 and later merged it with the AA breakdown firm in a combined group called Acromas. Acromas restructured the two companies last year to ensure their finances were entirely separate.Mr Goodsell owns a 7 per cent stake in the Saga, which is set to be worth £154million based on the company’s intention to sell 25 per cent of itself for £550million. Saga is being sold by private equity groups CVC, Permira and Charterhouse. The trio bought Saga for £1.3billion in 2004 . The Saga float marks the next chapter in the 60-year history of a company that began life as a guesthouse for retired holidaymakers in Folkestone. It has since expanded into areas including insurance, financial services, holidays and home care, all for the over-50s. It said it would use the £550million it raises to bring its debts down to £700million. Once the float is complete, it is expected to focus on building its financial services offering, in the light of government changes to the pension industry. This is expected to lead to a slump in annuity sales, but huge growth in other products that allow pensioners to invest their money in the stock market and elsewhere. Saga hopes to benefit from this, as well as the ageing demographic of the UK.","Saga is giving customers and employees priority in rush for shares .

""I think there's got to be more productive ways for us to be able to impress on the President the need to work for a permanent solution as opposed to a temporary stop-gap solution,"" Mitt Romney, former Massachusetts governor and two-time presidential candidate, said on the CBS show ""Face the Nation."" ""The President ought to let the Republican Congress, the Republican House and the Republican Senate, come together with legislation that they put on his desk which relates to immigration. And he can veto it or not, but let the Congress and let this election have its say, as opposed to jumping in by doing something unilaterally -- and in a way which is extraconstitutional -- he's poking an eye of the Republican leaders in Congress, and he's making it more difficult for there to be a permanent solution to this issue."" Another potential 2016 presidential contender for the GOP also weighed in. ""No, we shouldn't shut down the government,"" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said on ""Fox News Sunday.""  ""But absolutely they should do everything they can to force the President to follow the law."" In September, the White House announced that it would delay any action on immigration until after the November elections. Shortly after the midterms, the President left Washington for a weeklong trip to Asia and Australia.  Obama is scheduled to return to Washington on Sunday night, and the issue is expected to be at the top of his agenda. Sens.-elect James Lankford of Oklahoma and Tom Cotton of Arkansas both received calls from the President on Election Night, urging compromise on the issue. On Sunday, both resolved not to go down the same path as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who voted to shut down the government in October 2013, less than a year into his first term. ""We're not pursuing a government shutdown,"" Lankford said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""I don't think anyone wants to shut down government because that doesn't solve the problem,"" Cotton echoed. A few of their Republican colleagues mirrored their sentiments, with Sen. John Thune of South Dakota saying a shutdown ""doesn't solve the problem"" and Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma saying a shutdown is an ""inappropriate weapon (and an) inappropriate tool."" But in rejecting the government shutdown option, Republicans are now faced with a key question: Where must they compromise to pass a bill that the President will actually sign? Speaking at the G20 Summit in Australia on Sunday morning, Obama outlined his conditions. ""There is a very simple solution to this perception that somehow I'm exercising too much executive authority. Pass a bill I can sign on this issue,"" Obama said. ""If Congress passes a law that solves our border problems, improves our legal immigration system, and provides a pathway for the 11 million people who are here, working in our kitchens, working in farms, making beds in hotels, everybody knows they're there, we're not going to deport all of them. We'd like to see them being able to be out in the open, pay their taxes, pay a penalty, get right with the law."" Despite vocalizing his aggressive plans for unilateral action on immigration, Obama did concede that any executive action he takes could be undone by his successor. ""The very nature of executive authority means future presidents can reverse those actions,"" Obama said. In June 2013, the Senate passed a bipartisan immigration bill that outlined provisions to create a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented residents, while also beefing up security along the border. More than 500 days later, the House has yet to pass a bill of its own, a situation that House Speaker John Boehner insists exists because of the President's unwillingness to compromise. ""We're going to fight the President tooth and nail if he continues down this path,"" Boehner said at a news conference Friday. ""This is the wrong way to govern."" Defiant Obama says he won't bend to GOP .","President Obama is expected to take executive action if Congress doesn't act .

"Keys belonging to missing student Shane Montgomery have been found in a river close to where he was last seen, his family has revealed. Montgomery, a 21-year-old student at West Chester University, left a bar in Manayunk, Pennsylvania in the early hours of Thanksgiving Day and was caught on surveillance footage heading towards a parking lot - but has not been seen since. His disappearance  sparked a massive hunt and the offer of a $65,000 reward but searches, which have mostly focused on the Manayunk Canal, have so far turned up nothing. But on Sunday, divers searched the nearby Schuylkill River and found his keys in the water just south of the parking lot, his mother told the Philadelphia Daily News. Clue: Keys belonging to Shane Montgomery, pictured, have been found in the Schuylkill River, close to where he was last seen on November 27. He vanished after leaving a bar following a night of drinking . 'My heart is broken,' Karen Montgomery said. 'My son is somewhere in that river, and I need to find him and I need to bring him home.' His uncle Kevin Verbrugghe, told WPVI that the keys, which were on a Philadelphia Eagles lanyard, definitely belonged to his nephew because he tested them in Montgomery's front door. But there is still no sign of the student. 'It's just a piece to the puzzle,' Verbrugghe told WPVI. 'The puzzle is definitely not done.' Montgomery had been escorted out of Kildare's bar in the Manayunk neighborhood of Philadelphia at 1.50am on November 27 after he stumbled over the DJ's table. Final moments: A map shows the location of the bar where the 21-year-old student was last seen in Manayunk, Pennsylvania and his walk across a nearby bridge. The area is a district of Philadelphia, indicated top left . Last seen: The student was seen on surveillance footage crossing a footbridge, pictured, over the Manayunk Canal on November 27 - although the actual footage has not yet been released by police . Search: His disappearance has sparked a huge search involving the FBI, K-9 units and helicopters . He had spent the night of November 26 there with friends. It later emerged that he had a tab for $17 at the bar, indicating that staff had not served him an excessive amount of alcohol. The bar's owner said that he did not seem drunk and, when he accidentally bumped into the table, he was polite about it. One of the bar's employees walked him to the exit and saw him leave. Surveillance footage captured him walking across a footbridge over the Manayunk Canal to a parking lot on the other side. He was not seen returning. The footage has been withheld by authorities. Missing: Montgomery, a student at West Chester University, has this Celtic cross tattoo on his shoulder . Questions: His distraught parents, Karen and Kevin, have said they are thankful for everyone's prayers . Search: Teams searched the nearby canal last month but turned up no signs of Montgomery there . The FBI has joined the search and K-9s, helicopters and marine units have been used to help find the student - but there has been no sign of him. He is 5ft11 and 130lb, with short brown hair and green eyes. He was wearing a buttoned-down gray shirt, gray hoodie and jeans when he left the bar. He has a Celtic cross tattoo on his shoulder. His father, Kevin, previously told NBC: 'We're waiting for him to walk in the door, but you realize that each hour goes... it's just harder and harder.' A $65,000 reward is being offered for information leading to his whereabouts. Anyone with information is asked to contact Philadelphia Police Northwest Detectives at 215-686-3353.","Keys belonging to Shane Montgomery were found in the Schuylkill River in Manayunk, Pennsylvania during a search on Sunday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It is not the most elegant of haircuts – as this startled-looking alpaca has probably realised. But in the hot days of summer he may be grateful to be shorn of his winter coat. The South American animal is one of two kept by Nicola and Derek Waite at Baldersbury Hill Farm near Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland. Farmers use the animals to keep the grass down and deter foxes trying to get their lambs, while the alpaca clippings are sold to make clothing. The clippings can be used for luxury clothing and are worth in the region of £10 to £12 a kilo . Jackie Waugh travels up to 200 miles a day when he is shearing alpacas to keep them cool in the summer . The animals, Burns and Carruthers clipped by professional alpaca shearer Jackie Waugh, who travels up to 200 miles a day. Waugh said: 'Shearing an alpaca is not a doddle. It takes a long time to learn how to do it properly. 'It takes two people to secure one to a board. We then fleece it and check their teeth, do their nails and give them any injections they are due. 'The whole job takes between 10 and 20 minutes per alpaca, but with the relatively low numbers involved it’s not about speed. 'It’s more important that we do a good job for the owner and be as gentle as possible with the alpaca. You have to keep the alpacas calm during the shearing process. 'It’s still only early June and I have already clipped over 150 alpacas.

"Handed 15-month supervision order and 10-year ASBO banning him from possession of flares or fireworks not commercially available . By . Chris Brooke . PUBLISHED: . 11:19 EST, 3 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 21:22 EST, 3 September 2012 . Hobby: Paul Smith's 10-year habit of making DIY bombs in a workshop at his parent's house in East Hull came to an end in April when neighbours got sick of his explosions setting off their car alarms . An electrician gave a whole new meaning to DIY by building and setting off homemade bombs as a hobby, a court heard yesterday. Paul Smith was so obsessed with constructing explosive devices from a workshop at his parents’ house that his family gave him a birthday cake in the shape of a bomb. It carried the message: ‘Paul 40 today. Hope it goes with a bang.’ However, neighbours got so fed up with him setting off explosions that they complained to police. One explosion in Smith’s back garden set off all the local car alarms. Officers raided the home and found a huge collection of bomb-making equipment, Hull Crown Court was told. It included material of the type used by the Taliban in Afghanistan. Smith told officers he was not a terrorist or fanatic, but made the devices as a hobby for fun. He told police: 'I don’t know what all the fuss is about. Everyone knows I make small bombs. Some people collect stamps, I make small bombs.' He learned his skills from the internet and spent the past ten years making increasingly sophisticated bombs, the court heard. Some parts were made from household objects, such as a lunchbox which was turned into a remote-controlled detonator. He also collected gunpowder from unexploded bombs found in eroding cliffs on the East Yorkshire coast. Recognition: Unemployed drug user Smith set off so many of his homemade devices that this year his family bought him a bomb-shaped cake for his 40th birthday . In his workshop police found two live . pipe bombs and 20 to 30 detonators as well as shotgun cartridges, 9mm . bullets and gunpowder. Prosecutor Richard Woolfall said . chemicals including sulphur, iron oxide and magnesium were held in . storage jars on the shelves. He added: 'There was a mixture of sugar and . aluminium of the type used in Northern Ireland and by the Taliban in . Afghanistan.' An Army bomb disposal team was called in to make the home safe. David Gordon, defending, said Smith was 'a somewhat naive 40-year-old'. Serious: Police uncovered two live pipe bombs, 20-30 detonators, two battery packs and a sophisticated halogen light operating trigger at Smith's bomb-making workshop . Collection: Police also found a series of home-made detonators and a stock-pile of scaffolding tubing, 10 shotgun cartridges, a hoard of 9mm bullets and a store of gun-powder in the raid . He added: 'He has been in custody now . for five months and does not find it at all pleasurable. He is not a . terrorist. He does not have any radical religious or political opinions. He does have an unhealthy interest in explosive devices.' Smith, of Hull, pleaded guilty to . making or possessing explosives under suspicious circumstances and . another charge of possession of a class B drug. The court heard he had . lost his job and had taken to injecting amphetamines, to which he was . addicted. Dangerous: Chemicals including sulphur, iron oxide and magnesium were held in storage jars on the shelves and a pestle and mortar had been used to mix gunpowder . 'Some people collect stamps I make small bombs': Hull Crown Court heard Smith had lost his job as an electrician and had taken to injecting amphetamine . He was given a 15-month supervision . order, with a drug rehabilitation programme and 150 hours' unpaid work. A . ten-year anti-social behaviour order was also imposed, banning him from . possession of flares or fireworks which are not commercially available.","Police found two live pipe bombs, 20-30 detonators, two battery packs and a halogen light operating trigger .

"A recording of Shelly Sterling's frantic 911 call to report V. Stiviano breaking into her Beverly Hills mansion has been released, in which she reveals her husband Donald's ex-girlfriend entered the house through a side-door and was 'tormenting him'. Southern California real estate mogul Donald Sterling lost ownership of the L.A. Clippers basketball team in August when it was revealed that he made racist statements to Stiviano after she posted a picture with NBA legend Magic Johnson on Instagram. When police arrived at his house following his wife's call, Sterling told them that Stiviano was an 'invited guest'. The 911 call started rumors that Sterling was back with Stiviano, despite the controversy surrounding the tapes and the fact that he and wife Shelly are actively engaged in a legal battle with his ex-mistress. Scroll down for audio . Help: Shelly Sterling called 911 earlier this month to report a break-in at her Beverly Hills mansion. She told police that V Stiviano sneaked in through a side-door and was 'tormenting' her husband. Pictured above at a Los Angeles Clippers game on May 15. She and husband Donald Sterling were forced to sell the team this summer amid a racism scandal . No problem here: When police arrived at the home, Donald Sterling (pictured with glasses) told law enforcement that Stiviano (right) was his 'invited guest'. Stiviano was allegedly his mistress for a few years . Mrs Sterling was out of town on October 1 when her gardener called to say that  Stiviano had 'broke into the house' using a side door. Fame seeker: In the midst of the scandal that cost Sterling his team, Stiviano was pictured out and about L.A. in a series of strange attention-grabbing costumes . 'She's in an upstairs bedroom. You gotta go there fast because she's dangerous,' Mrs Sterling says in the recording released by TMZ. It appears Mrs Sterling didn't call her husband, before she dialed Beverly Hills police from France to report the'break in'. When asked to described the female intruder, Mrs Sterling called Stiviano an 'African black' and mentioned several times that she and her husband have an active lawsuit against her. The lawsuit, which predates the Clippers scandal, accuses Stiviano of taking gifts from the Sterling family including a Ferrari, $240,000 in cash and a $1.8million home in exchange for sexual favors. Stiviano has fought these charges, claiming that Sterling is actually a gay man who used her to hide his sexual orientation and that he paid for the lavish gifts with his own money. She said the female intruder was 'stressed about the suit' When the 911 operator asks for her husband's phone number, to check that he is alright, Mrs Sterling refuses. 'Well don't call him because he'll say nothing is happening it's OK because he doesn't want to have the problem so please don't call,' she said. About six police officers were dispatched to the scene and when they arrived, they talked to Sterling and let Stiviano stay at the house as his guest. Following the scandal in which the NBA forced him to sell his team, Mrs Sterling stepped in as a representative of the family and helped broker the record-breaking deal to sell the Clippers to ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for $2billion. Ballmer officially became the new owner of the clippers at the end of August. Separated: Shelly Sterling and husband Donald are still married, despite being estranged for some years.

Ms Gordon, 44, has filed formal complaints against the New York City Department of Education and Mr Scott, claiming that he groped her during a closed-door meeting and compelled her to send him naked pictures of herself in an attempt to save her job. She told the New York Post: 'I feel so stupid for believing he would help me. I was scared I was going to lose my job. I felt I had no choice. He had my life in his hands.' Mr Scott, who is married, admitted to the Post that he sent Ms Gordon raunchy messages, but denied assaulting her. 'She initiated it. I never forced anything on her.

'Why wud you like me to be,' Ms Gordon replies. 'Yes,' Mr Scott responds. In one series of exchanges, Mr Scott describes various sexual positions. 'Some may force u to scream,' he tells her.

Ms Godon frequently replied and admitted to sending him topless and bottomless photos. She claims she felt she had to entertain the perverse gestures or she would lose her job.

Anger: David and Rosemary Wickenden were appalled by the blunder after their grandson's death . A couple who raised their grandson have been offered child support money almost two decades after they applied - and 18 months after he took his own life. Blundering Child Maintenance Service staff wrote to David and Rosemary Wickenden to say Mitchell, who they took in aged eight in 1995, would finally start receiving cash. But the boy, who had grown up, joined the Army and served in Iraq, hanged himself aged 25 after suffering from depression. The couple from Southampton took in Mitchell and raised him as their own after his parents split up. Mr Wickenden, 74, said: 'We did all the legwork for child support years ago but never got anywhere, so this just shows what a mess they can make of it. 'If he was still alive Mitchell would be 27, so how can something like this happen? 'At the time we were told we could not claim off our son Paul because he was out of work. 'We got some money from their mother but it ended quickly. 'Then we got this letter and I was just amazed... We were only just beginning to get over our grief.

"A Virginia mother was outraged after a picture she posted on Instagram of her children became a focus for cruel and insulting comments. For Father's Day, Ciara Logan had put a picture online of her eight-year-old son and twin daughters aged 2. But what should have been a happy family photo quickly became a magnet for inappropriate comments after a stranger turned the photo into a meme. Ridiculed: An Instagram user turned what should have been a cute family picture into a cruel internet meme . Ms Logan only realized what had happened after noticing she had a new follower on Instagram. When she scrolled through that person's images, she saw her children's picture. The photo showed her children smartly dressed, with her son in a white suit and blue shirt, and the twins wearing cute summer dresses. But an unknown Instagram user had added a quote from The Color Purple under the image, saying: 'Harpo just won't let them girls be'. Underneath the meme, others had joined in the cruel joke, adding a series of insulting hashtags that suggested Ms Logan's son was a pimp, or that made light of the missing schoolgirls in Nigeria. Ms Logan told CBS 6 she was upset by the mocking comments which 'insinuate my son is a pimp, or is . selling cars, because he has on a suit and has two little girls with him . - or to hashtag, ""keep him away from those girls"", as if to say he's a . predator'. 'He's an 8-year-old boy who is very caring, very loving, very nourishing, very protective of his sisters.' she added. Shocked: Ciara Logan was upset to discover a picture of her children had been turned into a internet joke .

Instagram was also unable to help, advising the mother to simply remove all pictures of her children as a precaution, and to make her account private. Ms Logan said the incident had opened her eyes to the problems of the internet, and warned other parents to be more cautious. ''Get a page that is for family only and . private your page,' she said.

A Colorado dog owner has been left without his furry friend after the animal was grabbed off the street by a mountain lion, who killed and ate the canine. The incident last week in a Colorado Springs, Colorado, gated community, was the third such attack in two months. The unidentified man told authorities that he was walking his Dachshund when the mountain lion sprung out of some bushes and grabbed the dog - leash and all - and ran off. Scroll down for video . Attack: A dog owner has been left without his furry friend after the animal was grabbed off the street by a mountain lion, like the one seen here, who killed and ate the canine . Michael Seraphin, spokesman for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told KOAA-TV: 'The mountain lion came out from some bushes that are in close proximity to the street that he was walking on, grabbed the Dachshund, and tucked and pulled hard enough to yank the leash out of his hand.' The cougar then killed the small dog and ate it. Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokesman Michael Seraphin said the mountain lion was deemed a threat to public safety and a plan was set to capture it after the incident last Wednesday. Several hours after the attack, the mountain lion was successfully trapped. KOAA-TV reported that the animal was euthanized and sent to Fort Collins for a necropsy, where remnants of the Daschund were discovered in the cougar's stomach. CBS Denver reported that the incident was the third cougar encounter in the last two months, and residents claim it's been going on for years.

An . unidentified neighbor told the station: 'We know there are mountain . lions in the area, there have been other attacks several years ago. She added: 'Our backyard neighbor - a mountain lion climbed a tree and jumped onto her deck and took her dog.' While the prey of mountain lions is limited mainly to deer, there have been instances where they have attacked people. Colorado Parks & Wildlife officials urge anyone who may come face-to-face with a mountain lion to remain calm and move away slowly from the animal while talking firmly. It's important not to run. If a mountain lion acts aggressively, a person can throw sticks, rocks or branches to ward it off, as the cat will generally not attack prey that fights back.

"Andrew Chamberlain, 50, was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm and jailed for three years . A charity worker who broke his neighbour’s arm in three places with a four foot scaffolding pole during a row over a parking space has been jailed. Andrew Chamberlain, 50, became ‘abusive and threatening’ after 24-year-old Daniel Morgan parked outside his home on the terraced street in Blackwood, South Wales. The carer, who has 42 previous convictions including an offence of making a threat to kill in 2004, was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and jailed for three years on Friday. A jury at Cardiff Crown Court was told an argument erupted and Chamberlain took a large metal pole from his garden, raised it above his head and struck Mr Morgan - who blocked the blow with arm. Mr Morgan said: ‘It made a hell of a thud – the pain was excruciating. ‘He then brought the bar back as if he was going to hit me again.’ But Chamberlain claimed in an earlier hearing that he had been threatened by Mr Morgan and was using the pole to defend himself. He also said he needed regular access to the house where he lives with his 82-year-old mother because she suffers from severe arthritis and he needed to assist her. Mr Morgan said there were no official parking restrictions in the street but he would not have parked there if he’s known about Chamberlain’s mother’s health problems. The court heard parking was a 'contentious issue' on the street and residents had agreed to only park outside their own homes in Greenfield Terrace. Chamberlain has a string of convictions including aiming an air pistol at a woman’s head and threatening to shoot her, for which he was jailed for three and a half years. James Evans, defending, said he had ‘turned his life around’ and was a volunteer worker for a charity. Recorder Peter Griffiths told Chamberlain: ‘It is no pleasure for me to do the duty I have to perform. ‘You have turned your life around in the past 10 years. I was immensely impressed by the testimonials submitted in your behalf.’ The judge said despite the fact he is a carer for his mother he had to follow sentencing guidelines and an immediate custodial sentence was inevitable.

When a 38-stone unemployed woman was given an £8,000 gastric sleeve operation on the NHS, she knew she had been given the golden chance to turn her life around. But now Laura Ripley is now set to undergo a further £15,000 gastric bypass to help her lose weight and £12,000 worth cosmetic surgery. The 28-year-old complained that after slimming down to 20 stone because she had a gastric sleeve fitted, she lost her disability benefits because she was no longer fat enough to claim. Food for thought: Jobless Laura Ripley, 28, who will undergo a £15,000 gastric bypass at taxpayers' expense - three years after moaning that her disability benefit was being cut after her last operation . Left with 'just' £600 in handouts to live on each month, she moaned that she was unable to afford healthy food. Now, three years after she was first operated on, the junk food fan from Hastings, East Sussex, continues to eat chocolate and crisps every day. She is booked in for surgery so she can have a £15,000 taxpayer-funded gastric bypass. And . then she expects to receive a further £12,000 worth of cosmetic work to . improve the look of her body.

Junk food fan: Laura continues to eat crisps and chocolate bars every day but says she will stop if she undergoes a new gastric band operation . Weight loss: Laura Ripley is now set to undergo a further £27,000 worth of surgery to help her lose weight . This will bring the final cost of her medical treatment to £35,000. This time she hopes her weight problem will finally be brought under control. Laura claims all the surgery is vital as she does not have the willpower to slim down by herself. She told Closer magazine: 'Some people might say I don’t deserve the second operation, but I do. It’s not my fault. I crave chocolate like every other woman. 'I always allow myself a few treats a day - usually two packets of Quavers and a chocolate bar at night.' Laura believes that, since the sleeve was fitted, her stomach has gradually stretched and this has meant she has been eating more. She says she lost weight in advance of the sleeve op, but does not have the strength of mind to do it again. 'I sometimes feel guilty about all the money that has been spent on me,' she said. 'But, after the bypass, I could be 16st by Christmas. Then I won’t eat crisps or chocolate.' After she had the original operation, . Laura complained that because she had lost so much weight she no longer . qualified for £340 per month in disability benefits - so couldn't . afford to eat healthily. At the time she said: 'I can't afford . to buy WeightWatchers crisps and cereal bars any more so I eat Tesco's . chocolate bars and packets of Space Invaders crisps, sometimes four of . each a day. 'People ask why I don't snack on an apple - they're cheap, but emotionally I don't always feel like an apple.' Laura's decision to have further medical treatment has enraged Tam Fry from the National Obesity Forum. He said: 'Laura would have been told what to eat after her gastric sleeve, but she has ignored advice and gone back to her old ways. 'The NHS came to her aid when it was necessary. But now she is scrounging off the system and could be denying surgery to someone with a life-threatening illness like cancer.' Laura, who is a vegetarian, claims her . typical daily diet would be Rice Krispies for breakfast, jacket potato . with beans for lunch and spaghetti with Quorn Bolognese for dinner. But she admits that, once a week, she has two slices of toast for breakfast and treats herself to a salad wrap. Laura says she feels guilty about living off the state.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A California judge denied Thursday a request from an actress who, claiming she was a victim of fraud who'd been caused irreversible harm, wanted an inflammatory anti-Islam video in which she had appeared to be removed from YouTube's website. Cindy Lee Garcia, who was among those in ""Innocence of Muslims,"" had sued the producer of the film, Nakoula Basseley Nakoula -- who authorities say has numerous aliases -- alleging she is a victim of fraud, invasion of privacy and misappropriation of her likeness. In her complaint, filed Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court, Garcia also sued YouTube, the video-sharing website on which the film's trailer is posted, and its parent company, Google. She alleged the company caused her irreparable harm by not removing the video from its site and asked a judge to order the trailer be taken down immediately. YouTube attorney Timothy Alger, meanwhile, argued that federal law protects forums such as YouTube from abiding by such orders, from third parties, to remove videos. Actress in anti-Islamic film files lawsuit against filmmaker and YouTube . On Thursday, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Luis Lavin ruled the company can leave the video up online, denying Garcia's request for a temporary restraining order. Last week, the actress told CNN she had been unaware the filmmaker dubbed over dialogue in the movie and had inserted anti-Islam sentiments. The producer's representations that he ""intended to make an 'adventure film' and that (the) plaintiff would be depicted as a concerned mother, were false,"" Garcia alleges in her lawsuit. The defendant ""made an anti-Islam propaganda film, in which plaintiff is falsely made to appear to accuse the founder of the Islamic religion of being a sexual deviant and child molester,"" says the complaint. The lawsuit claims Garcia lost her job and her privacy since the film, on September 11, went from being an obscure Internet video to a target of Muslim protests worldwide. The film mocks the Islamic Prophet Mohammed as a womanizer, child molester and killer. From Morocco to Malaysia, demonstrators in more than 20 countries have railed against the ""Innocence of Muslims"" and the United States, since the film was (privately) produced and disseminated in the country. Some of these groups have targeted U.S. diplomatic missions, including those who breached the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, Egypt, and those who killed four Americans during an attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Garcia said that, since the video got widespread attention, she has received death threats and has not visited her grandchildren out of fear that they will be harmed. Calls to representatives of Nakoula were not immediately returned. Actor: Filmmaker 'was playing us along'","Actress in ""Innocence of Muslims"" filed complaint alleging she was a victim of fraud .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . PUBLISHED: . 07:16 EST, 23 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:13 EST, 24 October 2013 . Last night, Apple's CEO took to the stage ahead of the firm's latest iPad announcement and declared the tech giant recently sold its 170 millionth tablet computer. The announcement was accompanied by a simple looking line chart plotting the steady growth in iPad sales since the first model was unveiled back in 2010. Yet, news site Quartz took the chart and compared it with official sales figures to discover that not only is the chart 'misleading', it's been created in a way that covers up the firm's latest sales drop. New York-based journalist David Yanofsky recreated the Apple chart, pictured, using official sales figures and found the original, simplified version was 'misleading'. The pink line plots the actual cumulative sales, based on these figures, while the grey line is Apple's interpretation . According to journalist David Yanofsky: 'While that is a nice smooth curve, it . has little resemblance to the underlying data. Apple’s plot shows . cumulative iPad sales accelerating more slowly and more exponentially . than in reality.' Yanofsky plotted the official quarterly sales figures as bars along the x-axis, and used these to produce a more accurate cumulative sales line. This was placed over the top of the original Apple chart to highlight the difference. By showing the difference, Yanofsky was able to determine that at various points, the gap was wide enough to 'represent nearly 30 million units', which he claims creates a cumulative sales difference of around a third. Similarly, figures in the second and third quarter of this year show a drop in sales - which is likely to be due to the fact a new iPad was set to launch - yet the chart doesn't accurately reflect this. Apple's CEO Tim Cook, pictured, used the chart shown here to announce the firm recently sold its 170 millionth tablet computer. According to Cook, iPads now make up 81 per cent of tablet usage while competitor tablets combined make up just 19 per cent . Yanofsky ran a similar comparison when Apple announced its latest iPhones in September, and discovered a similar trend. He does highlight, however, that Apple hasn't overplayed the sales all the way through the chart, adding that although the distances between the labels are the same above 30 million, the gap between zero and 30 million is smaller. By creating this smaller gap, it gives the appearance of lower sales at the start of the first quarter. Also, for context, cumulative sales and quarterly sales aren't the same thing. Cumulative sales are, as its name suggests, a cumulative, overall view of all iPad sales since the first model was launched. Whereas quarterly sales look at specific sales over a three-month period so will reflect positive or negative growth depending on the time of year and other market considerations, such as new product announcements. Additionally, Apple is the first tablet maker to hit the 170 million-mark - a figure that is accurate - and iPads are said to account for 81 per cent of tablet usage. Competitor tablets combined make up just 19 per cent. New version: Apple's new iPad Air, right, is the fifth 9.7-inch model to be sold by the Californian-firm.

"(CNN)  -- The sagging economy is taking a bite out of federal school-meal subsidies as more students take advantage of free or low-price breakfasts and lunches, nutritionists say in a report released Thursday. About 425,000 more students are participating in the National School Lunch Program, a group reports. The School Nutrition Association surveyed more than 130 school nutrition directors from 38 states to produce its report, ""Saved by the Lunch Bell: As Economy Sinks, School Nutrition Program Participation Rises."" The nonprofit organization said that about 425,000 more students are participating in the National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program in 2008-09 than in the previous school year. That represents an average increase of 2.5 percent from 2007-08, the report says. These numbers hold true despite a slight decline in the number of students enrolled in public schools this school year, according to the study. More than three-quarters of the districts surveyed reported a rise in the number of students eating free meals under the U.S. Department of Agriculture program, the report says. Many of the school district employees who monitor the food programs complain that the federal subsidies fall far short of the rising costs. According to the association, the estimated average cost to prepare a school meal is $2.90, but the federal reimbursement is $2.57. School lunch programs are experiencing a potential loss of at least $4.5 million per school day, based on 30 million school lunches provided, the group says. The good news, according to association President Katie Wilson, is that ""this year, when hunger is more common, more students are able to eat a balanced, nutritious meal at school."" Meals served under the USDA programs must meet nutrition guidelines based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. For lunches, that means no more than 30 percent of calories can come from fat and fewer than 10 percent from saturated fat.","Number of students eating subsidized meals rises 2.5 percent, nonprofit says .

Her only hope was to abort the baby if she wanted to survive, doctors said. But desperate to keep the child, Miss Mullineux, 30, gambled on a second opinion – and was offered a pioneering operation to remove the tumour while the baby was in the womb. ‘One minute we were so happy at the thought of the baby, then suddenly I was faced with a life-threatening condition,’ Miss Mullineux said.

The elderly man rides the massive pig ever since an illness made him too sick to walk . The man has herded pigs for 30 years, and is commonly known as a 'swineherd', an older term for pig farmer that has disappeared into obscurity with the passing of time. He was originally skeptical that his idea would pay off, but after giving it a go, he found that it was a lot smoother than he thought it would be. After his realisation, he started riding the pig everywhere, from his house to market, to around the town. After a nasty bout of bronchitis, the swineherd toyed with the idea of riding the pig, which turned out to be a much smoother ride than he thought it would be . The man and his hog have become a slight celebrity sight in the town of Chongqing in China . China is the world’s largest pork consumer and half of the world’s pigs – nearly 480 million – are kept there. Last year the US’s largest pork producing company, Smithfields Farms, was bought by a Chinese company for £4.2billion.

Thanks to the pig being a sustainable vehicle, all he needs to keep going is a little bit of fuel for the pig in the form of some lettuce or scraps. A smooth ride: The pigs furry hide doubtless make it very comfortable, as the farmer raises a few eyebrows travelling down the roads . The pig is doubtless much cheaper than a car, as all it takes is some food rather than expensive petrol . This probably makes the pig far cheaper than a regular vehicle, and much more eco-friendly. While the 68-year old is able to walk, he much prefers riding his hog around town. The man seems incredibly jovial as he rides his pig, which has given him back the ability to travel around after his sickness .

A teenager destined to spend life behind bars for stabbing to death her newborn 135 times after secretly giving birth in the laundry room of her Minnesota home is back on a trial for a second time. Nicole Beecroft was just 17 when she was sentenced to life in prison for killing her baby girl - who she kept secret from her family - and throwing the towel-covered body in a trash can at the front of her Oakdale home in April 2007. But last year the now 24-year-old's conviction and life sentence was overturned. Her new trial began yesterday with explosive questions around whether the infant was already dead when she was knifed. Disturbing: Nicole Beecroft was 17 when she was sentenced to life in prison for killing her baby girl and throwing her body in a trash can at the front of her Oakdale home in 2007 . Second chance: Nicole Beecroft, now 24, is on trial for a second time over the alleged stabbing death of her newborn in 2007 . Defense attorney Christine Funk told a Washington County judge the crucial issue in the second murder trial was whether the baby was born stillborn, as Beecroft has always maintained. 'The state wants you to . focus on why Nicole would stab the baby if she were already dead,' Funk said, according to Twin Cities. 'The issue is whether the state can . prove beyond a reasonable doubt whether the defendant's actions caused . the death of that infant.' However prosecutors argue the baby was alive and never intended to keep the baby, going to great lengths to conceal the pregnancy. 'On her way downstairs, she . grabbed a steak knife and two scissors,' Washington County prosecutor Siv . Yurichuk said. 'She stabbed that baby 135 times. Over and over and over, until the baby was so fraught with wounds she . bled to death.' Beecroft reportedly told her best friend about the killing, whose family then tipped off police. Last year, Beecroft's life sentence without parole for first-degree premeditated murder was quashed by the Minnesota . Supreme Court. The court found Beecroft's rights of due process were violated because interfering prosecutors prevented the . defense from calling expert witnesses. Just a child: Nicole Beecroft was a senior at Tartan High School, pictured, when she allegedly stabbed her newborn to death . Yurichuk said the medical examiner who performed the autopsy determined the full-term baby was born alive and died from her wounds. 'Why would somebody stab a baby that's already dead?' she said. During the testimony of an Oakdale police officer, a recording was played of Beecroft's first police interview on April 10, 2007, before the infant's body had been found. Beecroft told the interviewing officers she 'went into panic mode' when the baby wasn't breathing, and lay with the baby for some time waiting for her to cry. She never mentioned the stabbing. 'What were you going to do if the baby was breathing?' one interviewer asked her. 'Bring her to the hospital,' Beecroft, who had never been in trouble with the law and worked two jobs, said. Horrific: Beecroft was sentenced to life in prison in 2008 for stabbing her newborn daughter to death with scissors and a steak knife . She said her mother Kari Beecroft, now deceased, and her mother's boyfriend were home at the time,  but she didn't tell them what was going on, according to Twin Cities. 'How can you throw your child in the trash? Whether your mom approves or not ... this baby had a chance at living,' an interviewing officers asked. Prosecutors said they will finish presenting their case next week.","Nicole Beecroft is on trial for a second time over the alleged stabbing death of her newborn in 2007 .

"By . Sarah Griffiths For Mailonline . The world watched in horror as images of once pristine beaches became coated in oil and thousands of species of birds struggled to survive in the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. But upsetting images of the ‘worst environmental disaster the U.S. has faced’ provided one physicist with the inspiration to devise a faster and more thorough way of mopping up spilled oil. It took Arden Warner just hours to come up with a method of magnetising oil so that the environmentally damaging fluid could be collected using a magnet. Arden Warner came up with the idea for magnetising oil after seeing the wide-reaching effects of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill (pictured in this satellite image). In his garage, he worked out the best size magnetic particles to mix with oil, in order to be able to move it using a magnet . Dr Warner, of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, saw the benefits of placing magnetic material in an oily solution instead of adding extra man-made chemicals to water. ‘Apply a magnetic field, and the particles will line up in the direction of the field. Orthogonally to that direction, the fluid becomes more rigid, and you can move or manipulate, it,’ he told PopSci. Taking to his garage, the physicist shaved iron off a shovel and mixed the filings with engine oil before trying to move the solution with a magnet. It worked, which led to hours experimenting with different fuels and size of filings. ‘When I started on it, I couldn't sleep for days,’ he said. Dr Warner discovered that magnetic dust measuring between two and six microns across worked well in over 100 different types of oil. Crude oil is naturally thick so that it does not flow easily but could be magnetised and cleaned up with a magnet. Tiny magnetic particles measuring between two and six microns could be placed in oil in the water. Their size would be calculated depending on how deep the oil has mixed in the sea. Magnetic oil could be collected and pulled from below the water's surface by using an electromagnetic boon. Once the oil is collected, the tiny magnetic particles would be separated from it so they could be re-used. The technique is more environmentally friendly than using more chemicals to break-down the oil. He worked out that the size of magnetic particles can be chosen depending on how deep they need to travel into the oily water in order to bond with it. Using this technique, he said: ‘You can pull oil from the bottom.’ This could be done on a large scale by using an electromagnetic boon. The magnetic dust could later be extracted from the oil and re-used, he explained. Dr Warner has used his technique to clean and oily bird and believes that one day it could help clean huge areas of coastline, like those polluted by the spill in the Gulf of Mexico. While the accelerator physics lab helped Dr Warner patent his process, he has now received interest from other parties that may want to commercialise it.","A physicist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Illinois, came up with the idea of using tiny magnetic particles to collect spilled oil .
Arden Warner was appalled by the environmental effects of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill around the coast of New Mexico .
In his garage, the physicist shaved iron off a shovel and mixed the filings with engine oil before moving the solution with a magnet .
He found the ideal size for the filings that work in 100 types of oil .
His method can be used to clean birds and could one day be put to work in massive clean-up operations, should another large spill occur .",b13476c1f020268f1bcc2e30ee06782334a420a9
"Is this Britain's oldest PCSO? Officer Martindale-Vale turned 70 yesterday but isn't going anywhere . When most people hit 70, they prefer to leave their working days behind and enjoy their golden years. But retirement can wait for one former Navy man who refuses to quit his job as a police community support officer. Ex-boxer Louis Martindale-Vale celebrated the milestone yesterday and could be Britain's oldest frontline officer, but he aims to be catching criminals for many more years to come. Officer Martindale-Vale, who lives in Great Barr, Birmingham, joined West Midlands Police in 2007 after been reassured by his wife that community policing would “suit you down to the ground"". In a career spanning 54 years, the granddad-of-four has proved he can turn his hand to almost anything. He joined the Navy aged 17 where his role with the Fleet Air Arm saw him perform 'shore patrols' to keep hundreds of sailors in check as they roamed ports in South Africa and Hong Kong. He also worked at Land Rover, as a golf course manager and even as a grave digger. But now, his only concession is to cut down to part-time hours due to his age. 'Working part-time was a 70th birthday present to myself,' he said. 'Age is no barrier to a fulfilling career later in life. 'I'm sure there are countless people - and maybe some who have already retired - who would make superb PCSOs.' Scroll down for video . The 70-year-old joined West Midlands Police seven years ago after an impressive career spanning 50 years . PCSO Louis Martindale-Vale on the beat around Erdington, Birmingham with cobbler Andy Boustead (left) inside Wilton Market . He added that when he finally does retire he will move with his wife Suzie, 59, to the seaside town of Skegness, Lincolnshire. 'We've got our eye on a place by the sea up there but it's a little while off yet.' Suzie, a retired carer, who has been married to Louis for 12 years, said: 'I told him he should get into community policing because I thought it would suit him down to the ground. 'Louis likes that sort of structure and keeping active so I said why don't you give it a go? Age is no barrier: 'I'm sure there are countless people - and maybe some who have already retired - who would make superb PCSOs' Louis joined the Navy aged 17 but his first application was rejected on height grounds. A year later, having grown half an inch, he was accepted . Louis Martindale-Vale joined the Royal Navy aged 17. Pictured here in 1961, he is training to shoot 303 rifles .

Hobbies: Left, the keen mountaineer climbing Snowdonia in 1990 and right, at Newell Birds of Prey Centre . 'And he's not looked back since. 'I think he'll just keep going as long as he can because he really seems to enjoy it. 'He's not told me when he'll stop so might have to put those plans in Skegness on hold for now.' Louis added: 'Erdington High Street has been my office for the last seven years and I love the role. 'It's great being out and about, helping the public and working with retailers to tackle shoplifters. 'There's nothing more satisfying than helping lock up a pick-pocket. 'It may have spared an elderly person the trauma of having their pension snatched or a teenager losing their new phone.' Superintendent Jo Smallwood said: 'Louis is a shining example of how PCSOs can play an important role in our communities, building relationships with organisations and members of the public - people ask to speak to him personally, share their concerns and have confidence he’ll act to address any issues. 'It’s great to hear him speak so passionately about the role and, when the day does come that he decides to hang up his uniform for the last time, he’ll be sorely missed.'","Louis Martindale-Vale joined West Midlands Police in 2007 after working for 50 years .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- U.S. envoy George Mitchell was in Israel on Thursday for his first visit since right-wing politician Benjamin Netanyahu became prime minister. U.S. envoy George Mitchell, right, meets Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman on Thursday in Jerusalem. It is Mitchell's third visit to the region since President Obama appointed him as special envoy for Middle East peace. Mitchell plans to meet with Netanyahu and other Israeli politicians Thursday, as well as Palestinian leaders -- including President Mahmoud Abbas -- in the West Bank and Jerusalem on Friday. The former senator and seasoned diplomat has not been shy in articulating the U.S. desire to see a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has led to speculation that the new Israeli government and the Obama administration may find themselves on a collision course. Netanyahu has indicated he wants serious negotiations with the Palestinians to continue, but he has not explicitly stated his support for Palestinian statehood. Questions about the new Israeli government's commitment to a negotiated peace process came up when the new foreign minister, nationalist politician Avigdor Lieberman, declared the Annapolis process ""null and void."" The Annapolis process, launched by the Bush administration in 2007, paved the way for the resumption of Israeli and Palestinian talks after they stopped earlier in the decade. After meeting Lieberman on Thursday morning, Mitchell said he had reiterated the U.S. stance. ""U.S. policy favors, with respect to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a two-state solution which would have a Palestinian state living in peace alongside the Jewish state of Israel,"" Mitchell said. ""We look forward also to efforts to achieve a comprehensive peace throughout the region."" Lieberman said the two men had a ""great opportunity to exchange some ideas"" and spoke about close cooperation. ""We spoke to coordinate our position regarding the Palestinian issue, regarding the area problems,"" he said. ""We are looking forward to the next meeting for some really deep dialogue about security, about economy, about all problems in the entire region."" The Israeli foreign minister said Israel will do everything necessary to improve the Palestinians' economic situation. But in a statement after his meeting with Mitchell, he emphasized that Israel expects an ""unequivocal commitment"" from the international community to Israel's security and to the Jewish state. Mitchell met Wednesday night with Defense Minister Ehud Barak, who told the U.S. envoy that the countries' bilateral relationship is ""deep and close."" ""It is possible to reach cooperation and understanding on all issues that are on the table,"" said Barak. The issue of Iran and its nuclear program was also a topic Thursday. After Mitchell met with Israeli President Shimon Peres, the president said he emphasized dialogue on the issue. ""It is our common interest that dialogue with Iran will expose if there is an opportunity with Iran or is it all a hoax,"" Peres said. ""We all want a world that is clean of nuclear bombs, but the problem is that those holding the bombs are religious fanatics, extremists, that do not cringe from all methods of killing. ""We need to create a wide international cooperation regarding the matter of Iran,"" he said. ""All this talk about a possible attack by Israel in Iran are not true. The solution to Iran is not a military solution."" Lieberman said the subject of Iran is a ""major problem"" for Israel and the whole region. ""If you are looking for a stable solution to the Palestinian problem, before everything else you have [to] stop the intensification and the spreading of the Iranian threat,"" Lieberman said in his statement. CNN Jerusalem Bureau Chief Kevin Flower contributed to this report.","George Mitchell to meet with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- No candidate won enough votes to secure outright victory in the first round of the Afghan presidential poll, the election commission said Thursday. The election will proceed to a runoff on June 14 between former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah and former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani, the two candidates who received the highest number of votes. In the first-round, in which around 7 millions Afghans voted on April 5, Abdullah secured 45% of the vote, while Ghani got 31.6%. A candidate needs to receive more than 50% of the votes to win the first round and avoid a runoff. Preliminary results had been announced in late April, but had to be finalized after investigations into fraud complaints. The final results from the runoff will be announced on July 22, the election commission said. It's the third election since the fall of the Taliban in 2001, and is set to be the first democratic transfer of power in the fragile, war-torn country. Abdullah was a vocal critic of the Taliban during their years in power, and although he was once an ally of incumbent President Hamid Karzai, serving in his government as foreign minister, he has in later years become an opponent. He challenged Karzai in the 2009 election but dropped out after the first round to protest what he said was large-scale voting fraud. Ghani is a former academic and U.S. citizen who gave up his passport to run for the Afghan presidency in 2009. He worked as an adviser to Karzai and also as finance minister in his Cabinet. CNN's Masoud Popalzai reported from Kabul, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.","No candidate secures more than 50% of votes .

"If you're tired of nagging your kids (or another member of your household) to brush their teeth, you have a new ally. A French company has introduced what they're calling the world's first connected electric toothbrush, which syncs wirelessly with a smartphone to track brushing habits, announce whether you, or your kids, have brushed thoroughly enough and reward you for good oral hygiene. For extra motivation, or shaming, the brush can share information with your social network or even your dentist. It's called the Kolibree toothbrush, and it was unveiled this week at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where some attendees asked if they could test prototypes on their pearly whites right there (for sanitary reasons, the answer was no). The device will cost from $99 to $200, depending on the model, and will be available for pre-order this summer through Kickstarter or another crowdfunding site. ""It works just like a regular toothbrush,"" said Kolibree spokesperson Renee Blodgett in a phone interview. ""The only difference is that all the data is stored on your phone so you can see how you're brushing."" Users download a mobile app and connect via Bluetooth, and the Kolibree documents every brushing via three sensors that record 1) how long you brush, 2) whether you brush all four quadrants of your mouth, and 3) whether you brush up and down (good) instead of just side to side (bad). The data automatically syncs to your Android phone or iPhone, telling you whether you brushed long enough and reached all the crucial areas of your teeth and gums. The Kolibree app charts your progress and scores your brushing technique to encourage you, or your kids, to improve brushing habits. In this way, the device turns a mundane daily activity into a game, which its makers hope will engage people -- especially kids -- and encourage them to brush longer and more often. ""You create this incentive around brushing,"" Blodgett said. The brushing data also will be available via an API to let third-party game designers develop new apps for the Kolibree system. The Kolibree toothbrush was invented by Thomas Serval, a French engineer and a leader in that country's tech industry. He was inspired to design it after suspecting that his children were lying to him about whether they had brushed their teeth. It's not the first ""smart"" toothbrush on the market, however: The manual, $25 Beam Brush went on sale about a year ago. The Beam also connects to phones via Bluetooth and records brushing time, although unlike the Kolibree it cannot track the brush's movements in the mouth.","A French company has introduced what they're calling the world's first connected electric toothbrush .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Love hurts, especially for jilted lovers on Valentine's Day. With that in mind, a London tourist attraction is offering visitors the chance to curse former boyfriends, girlfriends or spouses -- and get a discount on the entry price at the same time. ""Hex your Ex"" is the Valentine's Day promotion at the London Dungeon, a house of horrors that takes visitors through elements of the city's bloody, gruesome, and torturous past. To qualify, visitors must bring a picture of their ex -- or anyone who has  shunned them -- then rip it up and throw it in a smoking cauldron, spokeswoman Kate Edwards told CNN. Visitors can then select from a range of curses to inflict on their ex. ""If you happen to be single or freshly shunned, this is a way to move on and have a great way of doing it,"" Edwards said. Hexing your ex will earn you £5 ($7.20) off the entry price. ""It's very therapeutic, but it means in times of the credit crunch, you get money off as well,"" she said. The ""curses"" are meant to be taken lightly, she said. All were developed by the Dungeon's creative team. ""They involve marvelously bad things happening to your ex,"" she said. ""Nothing deadly, obviously. It's obviously tongue-in-cheek.""","London tourist attraction offers visitors chance to curse former lovers .

"Emmanuel Kanu: Accused of groping patient . A doctor groped a vulnerable divorcee in her home days after she had attempted suicide – but kept his job after citing 'cultural differences'. Dr Emmanuel Kanu stroked her breast, repeatedly tried to kiss her and told her, 'You want it' when she tried to escape his clutches during the visit - which he hid from colleagues. When she later texted him to tell him to stop ringing her he withheld his number on the next call. But Kanu, a married Nigerian father of one, has been allowed to keep his job by a fitness to practise panel even though the General Medical Council called for him to be struck off. He told the panel he had not molested the patient and claimed 'cultural differences' led to the visit on September 3, 2011, saying: 'There is a clear divide between the doctor and the patient here, which is very different in Nigeria.' But the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service only suspended the 36-year-old for six months, despite finding he was guilty of sexually motivated serious misconduct. Campaigners against violence towards women criticised the 'incredibly lenient penalty'. Nicole Westmarland, former chairman of Rape Crisis and Professor of Criminology at Durham University, asked 'what it takes for a doctor to be struck off'. She said: 'This doctor has committed a number of sexual offences on a woman who was in a very vulnerable position. 'A six-month suspension is an incredibly lenient penalty and the question remains: what will happen within the six months that will supposedly change his behaviour when he returns to work?' The doctor, who had recently completed GP training and was undergoing specialist training in psychiatry, was on a locum shift at the A&E department of Darlington Memorial Hospital, County Durham, when the divorcee was brought in after taking a 'substantial overdose'. She was still recovering in an emergency ward bed when he asked for her mobile number and then rang her when she was discharged five days later to say he was 'thinking of her'. He arranged to meet the mother-of-two, who cannot be named for legal reasons, at her home in Darlington for what the woman believed was a medical assessment. But he asked to use her laptop and then viewed Facebook photos of her as he sat next to her on a sofa. A report into his actions stated that he put his arm around her and stroked her chest. It added: 'She informed the panel she was ""scared, frozen to the spot"" and said ""I was unsure, he was a doctor"". Suspended: General Medical Council said Dr Emmanuel Kanu (pictured) should be struck off . 'She said when you saw the picture of her [breast] feeding her son you said ""They're big. Are they as big as that now?"" and squeezed her left breast.' When she stormed off to her kitchen Kanu followed her and kept trying to kiss her, saying at one point: 'I can see it in your eyes that you want it.' Kanu, who qualified in 2005 from the University of Nigeria, called her after he left but the woman, who was 43 at the time, texted: 'It was not right what you tried to do. You are a doctor and I was your patient. I didn't want or asked to be touched by you.' Kanu, who worked at Borders General Hospital near his home in Melrose, Roxburghshire, was acquitted of sexual assault at Durham Crown Court in 2012. He told the fitness to practise panel he had not molested the patient and claimed 'cultural differences' led to the visit on September 3, 2011, saying: 'There is a clear divide between the doctor and the patient here, which is very different in Nigeria.' But this was dismissed as not being a 'credible explanation'. The panel branded his behaviour 'deplorable' and 'unprofessional.' Kanu denied any knowledge of the case when approached by the Daily Mail. A spokesman for County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust said Kanu was dismissed as soon as the complaint came to light.","Dr Emmanuel Kanu stroked the woman's breast and told her: 'You want it'

"By . Alex Greig . An extremely rare coin, the first of its kind to be minted in the United States, has sold at auction in Florida for more than $4.5 million. The 1787 Brasher doubloon has been called the most valuable coin in the world, and the price it fetched at auction - $4,582,500 - paid by an anonymous bidder, confirms that. The coin, the first of its kind, was made by a silversmith named Ephraim Brasher who lived next door to George Washington after the Revolutionary War at 1 Cherry St on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Four million dollar coin: The legendary Brasher doubloon features a rising sun on its front . Reverse: The back of the coin features Ephraim Brasher's initials on the wing of the eagle . He created the Brasher doubloon in 1787. According to Heritage Auctions, the design on the front of the coin was adopted from the New York coat of arms - a sun rising of the peak of a mountain with a body of water in the foreground. Brasher's name is spelled out below the waves in small letters and the words around the edge of the coin say NOVA EBORACA COLUMBIA EXCELSIOR - New York, America, Ever Higher. Excelsior remains the state motto to this day. On the reverse, an eagle with wings outspread, a shield covering its body and an 'EB' stamp over one of the wings. It has an olive branch in its claw and 13 stars surrounding its head. Around the edge of the coin is the legend 'UNUM E PLURIBUS,' which translates as 'one of many.' The coin measures 28.6mm and weighs 26.66 grams and is 89 per cent gold, six per cent silver and three per cent copper. It contained about $16 worth of gold, which in the late 18th century was a not insignificant amount of money. Pop culture: The Brasher doubloon was the subject of a Raymond Chandler mystery novel (left) which in turn became a film (right) It has been called the most valuable and most important coin in the world. 'The legendary Brasher Doubloon is one of the most important coins in American history because it's the first gold coin struck for the young United States and it's one of only a handful that exist,' said Todd Imhof, executive vice president of Heritage Auctions. The doubloon hasn't been offered for sale since it was bought by a Chicago resident in 1979 for $430,000. The coin was at the center of the plot of a 1942 Raymond Chandler novel called The High Window, which was later adapted into a film noir and called The Brasher Doubloon. The novel was a Philip Marlowe mystery about the fictional theft of the Brasher doubloon. It was purchased during the U.S. Coin Signature Auction last week at Florida's United Numismatics Convention in Orlando.","The Brasher doubloon has sold at auction for $4,582,500 .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The venerable CBS soap opera ""Guiding Light"" will go dark in September after 72 years and 16,000 episodes, the network announced Wednesday. Gina Tognoni is one of many performers who have appeared on ""Guiding Light"" over the years. The daytime drama's declining viewership led to the decision, according to a CBS spokeswoman. The show, which the Guinness Book of World Records lists as the longest-running television drama, first aired on NBC radio in 1937 as a 15-minute serial, the spokeswoman said. It moved to television on the CBS network in 1952 as 15-minute drama. It later went to 30 minutes, and on November 7, 1977, it expanded to one hour and introduced the wealthy Spaulding family as foils to the show's middle-class Bauers, who were a mainstay of the show for much of its run. In 1979, the show did a groundbreaking storyline when the character of Roger Thorpe (played by the late Michael Zaslow) raped his wife, Holly (Maureen Garrett). The marital-rape story line reflected a significant real-life case in 1978 -- the state of Oregon v. John J. Rideout. It was the first time in modern U.S. history that a man was charged with raping his wife and then put on trial. It prompted national debate about whether a man had absolute sexual rights with his spouse. Rideout was acquitted. Among the actors who went on to greater fame after roles on the show: Kevin Bacon, James Earl Jones and Taye Diggs. The last episode is set to air on September 18, the spokeswoman said.

"A three-judge panel court on Tuesday acquitted Baltimore Orioles pitcher Alfredo Simon of charges in the shooting death of a man in his hometown. Simon was charged with involuntary murder in the death of Michell Esteban Castillo, 25, and with injuring the victim's cousin Starlin Castillo, 17, early on January 1 in the nearby town of Luperon. Defense attorneys argued that the prosecution failed to prove Simon fired the pistol that killed Castillo, who he said was a childhood friend, during a New Year's Eve celebration. Prosecutors claimed that Simon had bribed witnesses, including the wounded cousin, who on Tuesday appeared less certain that Simon was the shooter than he had been in previous statements to police and the media. Prosecutors said they will wait for the official verdict to be released but plan to appeal to the regional appellate court in Santiago. In the Dominican Republic, prosecutors can appeal an acquittal to a higher court within 20 working days. Simon faces a 10-year sentence on the charges. The 30-year-old right-hander started 23 games for the Orioles this season and posted a record of 4-9 with a 4.90 earned-run average. According to local news website gentetuya.com, Simon is expected to sign a $12 million contract with the Orioles.","Alfredo Simon was charged with killing one man, wounding another on January 1 .

"Quite the spread: Rosney, 54, takes 38 separate pills and supplements to treat his body and brain. He has an IQ of 192 . A man with a claim to being the second-most intelligent person on the planet has revealed that he takes a mixture of 38 drugs and pills every day in a bid to stay in top mental and physical form. Rick Rosner, 54, boasts an IQ of 192, which has seemingly only been topped by a Greek doctor, Evangelos Katsioulis, according to the world genius directory. But despite his apparent intellectual capacity, Rosner lists himself as unemployed while he works on writing a book entitled Dumbass Genius. The former TV writer and bouncer instead spends his time developing theories, working on a book, and visiting some five gyms per day, aided by cocktail of medical supplements. Rosner, who revealed the routine to Business Insider, listed a staggering array of substances, ranging from coffee and aspirin to an experimental pill designed to remove protein from the brain. Speaking to MailOnline about his routine, Rosner said he takes the pills because: 'I'd like to remain healthy and live for as long as possible. 'A lot of these things may not do anything for you - if I had to guess maybe only a third of this stuff has benefits. 'I try to read up about what these things are supposed to do - as new studies come out sometimes I swap things in and out.' 'I probably alter what I take on a three-to-four-monthly rotation.' Along with the supplements, Rosner has also estimated that he spends around two and a half hours per day in the gym, sometimes visiting five locations in a day. 'Working on my book': Rosner, who tweeted this picture of himself recently, now spends his time writing his book Dumbass Genius . When asked why he sticks to the intense routine, he replied: 'I like it', and said that it is part of the 'obsessive' personality which led him to testing his mind rigorously enough to come out with the 192 IQ score. Rosner, who lives in Los Angeles with his wife of more than 20 years, spent years as a bouncer in bars, and even as a nude model, before starting to work in television. He said his IQ score was originally came from 'desperation to have something going for me' while working menial jobs and trying to get a girlfriend. Pills, pills pills: Rosner listed 38 separate supplements, though admits a two-thirds of them probably don't do anything . But even now, after a series of jobs in television and even an Emmy nomination, Rosner defends the tests as 'the best of a bad bunch' when it comes to quantifying intellect. In a nod to the fact that IQ doesn't tell the whole story, between gym sessions and pill-popping Rosner writes a book of memoirs he will entitle Dumbass Genius.

Watching Lancôme's latest fragrance advert, it is impossible to believe that Julia Roberts is nearing her half century. The 44-year-old actress positively glows in the latest offering for the brand, for which she is an ambassador. Directed by Mirror Mirror director Tarsem Singh, Julia glides through a crowded party as a bottle of Lancôme's latest fragrance, 'La Vie Est Belle', glimmers under the chandelier lights. Scroll down for video . Julia Roberts looks far younger than her 44 years in the new Lancome fragrance advert . Roberts has been an ambassador for Lancôme since 2010 but this is her first fragrance campaign with the French beauty company. A campaign she did for the brand last year was banned by the Advertising Standards Authority, who deemed L'Oreal, parent company of Lancome, had used digitally retouched images that could 'mislead' the viewer. L’Oreal said at the time that image had been digitally re-touched to ‘lighten the skin, clean up make-up, reduce dark shadows and shading around the eyes, smooth the lips and darken the eyebrows’. However, again, it insisted that the image was an accurate reflection of the benefits of the product. The ASA was not convinced, ruling the images could not be used again in their current form. Here though, it cannot be denied that Julia Roberts is in possession of a striking natural beauty. Dressed in a floor length white dress that reveals her ample cleavage, the star shines in her role.

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Max Chilton has every confidence he will be retained by Marussia for a third consecutive season. Chilton started the campaign relatively strongly, claiming the best results of his Formula One career by finishing 13th in the season-opening race in Australia and again in Bahrain. In Monaco, however, team-mate Jules Bianchi stole Chilton's thunder as the Frenchman scored Marussia's first points from their four and a half years in F1 with ninth place in Monaco. Centre of attention: Max Chilton remains hopeful of being retained by Marussia for the 2015 season . Since then Chilton has struggled for form and results, but the 23-year-old from Reigate in Surrey sees no reason why Marussia would not retain him for 2015. 'I naturally want to stay with the team,' said Chilton. 'Like a lot of these things they filter down from the top, and there are a lot of rumours with regard to the top of the grid, with people moving around and you don't really know where you stand until then. 'I won't focus on that until later on in the year, but I'm confident I'll be here next year. I've had good races this year. 'I started off fairly strong, and okay the last few have not been particularly great, but I feel we've got to the bottom of that. Overall I've been consistent and had good results.' Chilton may yet be thanking Bianchi for that result in Monaco as the young Briton would like to believe it could play a key role in his own future. On track: The British driver joined the team in 2013 and finished every race of his debut season . Those two points mean Marussia lie ninth in the constructors' title race ahead of both Sauber and Caterham. If Marussia can hold on to that position the financial rewards would be considerable, which in turn may mean Chilton not having to find the cash to fund his seat. 'Marussia have a good future, especially if we hold off Sauber for ninth. That would really build up momentum,' added Chilton. 'That would be a big help to the team financially if we could do that as it would help us develop the car for next year. 'If the team gets this ninth then we might not need to worry about that (his financial situation). That's just me really thinking of the bigger picture. 'I've not properly looked into it, but I'd like to think I could continue to help the team develop over the next couple of years.'","Chilton is hopeful of racing at Marussia for a third straight season .

"(CNN) -- Food prices in Indonesia rise during the holy month of Ramadan, but that hasn't stopped Ghazmawati Akmalzen from stocking her shelves to celebrate next week's end of daylight fasting. ""It's not possible to cut down on food and ingredients because we're going to have friends and family over,"" she said. The spending power of Akmalzen and 242 million other Indonesians shows why this secular Muslim nation is a bright spot in a darkening global economy. Thanks to strong economic demand, this emerging market was able to shake off sagging exports due to eurozone troubles and slowing demand from China. The latest figures Monday from Southeast Asia's largest economy showed Indonesia's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 6.4% year-on-year last quarter. ""The second quarter numbers beat market expectations and showed the resilience of the Indonesian economy - that was very much because of the strength of investment which grew 12% year-on-year and also the strength of consumer demand,"" said Rajiv Biswas, chief Asia economist for IHS Global Insight. ""Domestic demand was the key factor here."" More foreign companies are looking to profit from growth in the world's most populous Muslim nation. When Nissan Motor Company resurrected the Datsun brand, CEO Carlos Ghosn made the March announcement in Indonesia, where the Japanese automaker plans to build and sell the new car in 2014, to take advantage of the nation's both rising manufacturing prowess and growing middle class. Late last year, Boeing made its largest single aviation sale - 230 planes totaling $21.7 billion - to Lion Air, a domestic airline virtually unknown outside of this archipelago nation of 6,000 inhabited islands. Tony Fernandes, CEO of regional low-cost carrier Air Asia and chairman of the Queens Park Rangers football club, caused headlines recently by announcing his move from his native Malaysia to Indonesia. ""Jakarta has the potential to be the biggest market for Air Asia,"" Fernandes told CNN Tuesday at the launch of Air Asia ASEAN in Jakarta. ""It's also home for ASEAN. So it's a statement we want to accelerate change in ASEAN and we've made the bold move of physically relocating ourselves here. ""We believe there is a massive market potential that's untouched here -- that's what we're after,"" he said. Global Insight, an economics consulting firm, predicts the Indonesian economy will grow five-fold by 2030 to become a $4.5 trillion economy - roughly the size of Germany's economy today. ""That's very important -- not only does it mean Indonesia's GDP and per capita income are going to rise very substantially ... but also it's very important for the rest of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), because Indonesia is going to act as a growth driver for other ASEAN economies and for Asia regionally,"" Biswas said. Experts also talk about spurring more equitable growth that reaches Indonesia's poorest. In June, food staples tofu and soybean curd all but disappeared from markets for three days. The prolonged U.S. drought jacked up soybean prices to record highs, prompting local producers to go on strike. ""People look for tofu and soybean curd because that's what they eat. So for the poor, it's very difficult. If the prices are too high, who suffers? It's the poor,"" tofu vendor Haji Siti told CNN. Consumer prices were up 4.5% percent last quarter from a year earlier. Despite the country's growing investment, its infrastructure lags behind other developing economies such as China. ""I'm very bullish but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't introduce policies that would both accelerate growth further and improve the quality of growth,"" said Milan Zavadjil, senior representative for the International Monetary Fund in Indonesia. ""Particularly more investment in infrastructure is absolutely essential to get rid of some of the current (traffic) bottlenecks, more investment in education to improve human skills and allow industry and other sectors to move up the value chain,"" Zavadjil said.

"(CNN) -- Yuvraj Singh held his nerve to steer India into the last four of the World Cup and end Australia's 12-year reign as champions. Yuvraj struck a vital 57 not out to ensure co-hosts India reached their target of 261 with more than two overs to spare and book a semifinal clash with Asian rivals Pakistan. Earlier, captain Ricky Ponting had hit an imperious 104 and Brad Haddin a quickfire 53 as Australia reached a competitive total of 260-5. But half centuries from Sachin Tendulkar and Gautam Gambhir edged India towards their target before Yuvraj and Suresh Raina propelled them over the line. After the game Yuvraj told Sky Sports: ""The pressure was something else. People say it's just another game, but beating the three-time champions I feel is really special for me and our team."" Defeat came as a bitter blow to Ponting, who has had to field questions about his future both as player and captain throughout the tournament, but he later insisted he wouldn't be stepping down. ""We competed hard, there's no doubt about that,"" he said. ""We thought we were in with a chance at the half-way stage, and that we had a reasonable total. ""But we didn't bowl as well as we needed to, we needed more wickets from the middle order. It's disappointing to be bowing out now. I wish India well for the rest of the tournament."" Australia made a quick start to their innings as Haddin and Shane Watson put on 40 but it was with Ponting's arrival at the crease that the impetus began to grow. Despite a shaky start, Ponting soon punished some wayward Indian bowling to record his first century in 13 months, and despite Michael Clarke, Mike Hussey and Cameron White going cheaply David Hussey added a valuable 38 as Australia made 260-5. India reached 44 in their reply before Virender Sehwag fell but Tendulkar (53) and Gambhir (50) continued the charge with a partnership of 70 before the batsman known as ""the little master"" was dismissed by Shaun Tait. When Virat Kohli and Indian captain MS Dhoni were removed in quick succession, Australia could sense the game changing. But Yuvraj showed plenty of character to lead his side home, despite the calamitous run out of Gambhir. Raina added a vital 34 and when Yuvraj smashed the winning runs it sparked wild scenes of celebration in Ahmedabad. Meanwhile, England spinner Michael Yardy has flown home from the World Cup because he is suffering from depression. The 30-year-old, who took two wickets during his three games at the tournament, said on the England and Wales Cricket Board's website: ""Leaving at this stage of the World Cup campaign was a very difficult decision to make. ""But I felt it was the only sensible option for me and I wanted to be honest about the reason behind that decision."" Hugh Morris, the managing director of England Cricket, said: ""I would like to offer my full support to Michael on behalf of everyone involved with the England team and the ECB. ""Michael has been an integral part of the England set-up in recent years and while he will be missed in the knock out stages of the World Cup, our priority now is to ensure that he returns home to his family and is able to spend time recovering with a strong support network around him.""","India defeat reigning Cricket World Cup champions Australia by five wickets .

"(CNN)  -- Andy Roddick denied rising Canadian star Milos Raonic his second straight ATP Tour title as he rounded off a three-set final victory in Memphis with a diving forehand passing winner. It wrapped up a 7-6 (9-7) 6-7 (11-13) 7-5 victory for the American top seed after Sunday's epic battle with his 20-year-old opponent, which lasted two hours 26 minutes. ""That's the best shot I've ever hit in my life, considering the circumstance,"" Roddick told the official ATP Tour website. ""He had a great volley there. I don't really remember much else besides the fact that I went for the ball. I hit it. I didn't really think much of it. Then I heard people cheering. I was like, 'No, there's no way that went in.' "" Raonic, who came to prominence by claiming the ATP title in San Jose last week as a wildcard entry, pushed the world number eight to the limit, leveling the match when he won a marathon second-set tiebreak. His big serving eclipsed even Roddick, pummeling down 32 aces to take his tally for the week to 129 -- comfortably a new tournament record. Mark Philippoussis set the previous best total of 106 in 2001. But Roddick's full-stretch winner on match-point in the 12th game of the decider gave him his 30th career title from 50 finals and his third victory in Memphis. ""I think I was very fortunate,"" Roddick added. ""I feel like I got outplayed. I just stuck around and kept trying. ""He's as exciting a talent as we have seen in a while. It won't surprise me if he's top-10 sooner rather than later."" Roddick is third among active players in career titles, trailing only Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal after adding to his Memphis wins in 2002 and 2009. Raonic, playing just his ninth top-level tournament, climbed to 37th in the world -- making him the highest-ranked Canadian player in ATP Tour history, surpassing the 41st reached by Greg Rusedski in 1994 before he opted for British citizenship. ""It's not by any means something to be too happy with because I want to keep improving that. I want to keep progressing and developing and I think I can do a lot more,"" Raonic said. ""A lot has happened since the beginning of the year. I'm going to take the moments I need, take the time, think about it, learn from it, as well as use it to my advantage in the future."" Raonic's compatriot Rebecca Marino suffered disappointment in the women's final in Memphis, having to withdraw with a stomach injury after losing the first set 6-2 to Slovakia's Magdalena Rybarikova.

Former Lord Mayor of Liverpool Eddie Clein said some poor families find the money for gadgets but not food . People who use food banks would rather spend their money on iPhones than feeding their families, a former city Lord Mayor has claimed. Lib Dem Eddie Clein accused people in Liverpool of always having money for the ‘non-necessities of life’ but then struggled to put meals on the table. The comments sparked a fresh row about why poor families turn to food banks, after Education Secretary Michael Gove suggested they have only their own bad financial ‘decisions’. More than half a million people across Britain have turned to food banks to stave off hunger, according to charities. Mr Clein, a former councillor for four decades and ex-Lord Mayor of Liverpool, said that those struggling financial still found the money for expensive gadgets. The pharmacist told BBC Radio Merseyside: ‘I go to some of these homes, I do prescriptions for them ... and what makes me feel uncomfortable is they’re all standing their with their iPhones. ‘This is what Michael Gove was talking about. They don’t seem to have a shortage of money for the non-necessities of life, but when it comes to choosing whether to put food on the table or buy some stuff to make some meals ... I don’t know.’ He later added: ‘What I can’t come to terms with is that I see so many people who are claiming poverty, and may well be using food banks, who are standing their using an iPhone, even when you are talking to them.’ But the remarks were condemned by Labour MPs in the city. Luciana Berger said: ‘Eddie Clein’s comments are an absolute disgrace. ‘I have visited several food banks in Liverpool and across the country and had many conversations with people who’ve been forced to turn to them. ‘I vehemently disagree with Eddie Clein that food bank users are making a lifestyle choice. No-one goes into a food bank with their head held high.’ Demand: Charities say there has been a sharp increase in people turning to food banks, including this one in Southwark run by Felicia Boshorin . Row: Labour MP Luciana Berger has challenged criticism of people who use food banks, including Education Secretary Michael Gove who blamed bad financial 'decisions' Walton MP Steve Rotheram added: ‘How does he know people haven’t been given these iPhones as Christmas or birthday presents. He’s incredible.’ A furious political row erupted this week after Tory Education Secretary Mr Gove argued that people who find themselves unable to buy essentials, including food and school uniforms have themselves to blame for being unable ‘to manage their finances’. Speaking in the Commons he said: ‘I appreciate that there are families who face considerable pressures. ‘Those pressures are often the result of decisions that they have taken which mean they are not best able to manage their finances. ‘We need to ensure that support is not just financial, and that the right decisions are made.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband condemned the minister as an ‘absolute disgrace’.","Eddie Clein accuses people in Liverpool of buying 'non-necessities'

"(CNN)  -- Argentina's star-studded line-up began their World Cup campaign with a 1-0 victory over Nigeria in their Group B opener in Johannesburg on Saturday. A goal from defender Gabriel Heinze after six minutes was all that separated the two teams after an inspired display from Nigeria goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama. But South Korea ended the day on top of the group following a 2-0 victory over Greece in Port Elizabeth earlier on Saturday. Goals from Lee Jung-Soo and Park Ji-Sung gave the 2002 semifinalists a comfortable win over the 2008 European cvhampions. Argentina 1-0 Nigeria . Enyeama could do little to stop Heinze's powerful early header from a Juan Sebastian Veron corner, but he kept his team alive with a string of acrobatic saves to deny World Player of the Year Lionel Messi. Diego Maradona was delighted to secure his first victory as a World Cup coach, but critical of his strikers for failing to make the game safe. ""When you don't kill things off in front of goal you can pay a heavy price. They almost got a draw -- we missed loads of chances,"" Maradona told AFP. ""Players such as Leo Messi and Higuain knocked in around 60 goals last season between them, yet today it was almost as if they couldn't set their sights on goal. ""But the win means we can be calm -- we are in the right track."" Enyeama's tip over from a Messi shot led to the early corner from which the unmarked Heinze scored to spark scenes of wild celebration on the Argentina bench, led by Maradona. Messi and Gonzalo Higuain might both have had hat-tricks as Argentina's attacking flair was evident, but at the other end Nigeria also had opportunities to salvage a point. Midway through the second half, Taye Taiwo found space to toe-poke a shot from the edge of the area which went just wide of Sergio Romero's left-hand post. CNN's World Cup twitter.buzz . As the clock ticked down, Enyeama blocked Messi as he looked certain to score but in a swift counter attack Nigeria then had their best chance of the match as Aiyegbeni Yakubu crossed from the right and Kala Uche made a hash of his volleyed attempt from 10 meters out. At the final whistle it was a deserved victory for Argentina, but they will face a sterner test in their next match in five days' time against South Korea. Nigeria, who have lost five and drawn once since their last World Cup finals victory in 1998, will be looking to break that winless run against the Greeks, who also have a poor record in football's global showpiece. South Korea 2-0 Greece . Goals from Lee Jung-Soo and Park Ji-Sung earned South Korea a comfortable 2-0 win against a poor Greek side, who never looked like getting on the score sheet. Central defender Lee opened the scoring in the seventh minute, volleying home from close range from a well directed free-kick delivered by Ki Sung-Yong. South Korea should have gone 2-0 up after 23 minutes when Monaco striker Park Chu-Young was sent through on goal by a defense-splitting pass from the boot of Park Ji-Sung, but goalkeeper Alexandros Tzorvas saved to send the ball onto the roof of the net. The second half carried on where the first finished off, and it was no surprise when Park Ji-Sung added a second goal after 52 minutes. Latching on to a mistake made by Loukas Vyntra, the Manchester United midfielder swept forward into the penalty area before coolly slotting past a helpless Tzorvas. The goal did seem to finally wake Greece from their slumber, and striker Theofanis Gekas forced a fine save from Jung Sung Ryon in the 80th minute, but it was a rare moment of skill in a woeful display. Moments later, Lee Chung-Young nearly added a third for South Korea at the other end. The result means Greece continue their winless World Cup finals record. Their only other appearance in 1994 yielded no goals and no points.","Argentina beat Nigeria 1-0 in their World Cup Group B opener at Ellis Park .

"(CNN) -- Myanmar has invited the United States and the European Union to send representatives to observe elections in April, according to officials in the region. Surin Pitsuwan, the secretary-general of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, said in a post Wednesday on his official Twitter account that Myanmar's deputy minister for foreign affairs had told him that all members of the association's regional forum were invited to observe the elections. The regional forum is much broader than the association's core membership and includes the United States and the European Union, as well as big Asian democracies such as India and Japan. An official from Myanmar's Information Ministry, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the matter, confirmed that the country had offered to let the U.S. and the EU election monitors observe the by-elections due to be held on April 1. International attention is focused on the April elections, which are seen as a test of the Myanmar's government's commitment to lasting political reform. The international community has applauded recent steps toward greater openness in Myanmar, also known as Burma, long secluded from the rest of the world after a military junta grabbed power in 1962. The generals are loosening their grip after international sanctions and criticism over their regime's human rights record. The opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy, will participate in the by-elections after boycotting previous votes. Suu Kyi, who was released from years under house arrest in 2010, has been crisscrossing the country to attend election rallies. Earlier this month, state television broadcast an election campaign speech by Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, for the first time. On Tuesday, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations said that Myanmar had invited member states of the organization to each send two legislators and three media representatives to observe the elections. The 10-member association comprises of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Its goal is to promote economic growth and regional stability. CNN's Jethro Mullen and Kathy Quiano contributed to this report.","April by-elections in Myanmar are seen as a test of recent reforms .

"World Cup-winning coach Marcello Lippi has retired from football management. The 66-year-old Italian announced his decision on Sunday, after winning a third successive Chinese league title with Guangzhou Evergrande. Lippi, who spent most of his playing career with Sampdoria, entered management in in 1982. He went on to coach 13 different teams including Italy, Juventus, Napoli and Inter. Marcello Lippi secured his third straight Chinese league title and then immediately announced his retirement . Marcello Lippi won the World Cup with Italy in 2006, his side beat France in the final in Germany . Lippi, smoking one of his trademark cigars, talks to goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon after winning the World Cup . 1995: Wins Serie A, Coppa Italia and Supercopa with Juventus. 1996: Wins Champions League, European Super Cup and Intercontinental Cup with Juventus. 1997: Wins Serie A and Supercopa with Juventus. 1998: Wins Serie A for third time with Juventus. 2002: Wins Serie A and Supercopa with Juventus. 2003: Wins Serie A and Supercopa with Juventus. 2006: Wins World Cup with Italy. 2012: Wins Chinese Super League and Chinese FA Cup with Guangzhou Evergrande. 2013: Wins Chinese Super League and Asian Champions League. 2014: Wins third consecutive Chinese Super League title. Lippi, the only coach in history to have won both the European and Asian versions of the Champions League, said: 'I don't want to coach any more, I'm too old. 'Guangzhou Evergrande will have a new coach next season.' He added that he will take over as technical director. Former Italy and Juventus defender Fabio Cannavaro is among the favourites to replace him as coach of the Chinese team. Lippi steered Italy to World Cup success in 2006 where they defeated France in a final that will be remembered for Zinedine Zidane's headbutt on Italian defender Marco Materazzi. Unfortunately for Lippi, he could not emulate that success in his second spell in charge of the Azzurri - they were eliminated in the group stage four years later in South Africa. By far his most successful periods as a club manager came in Turin. In two spells at Juventus (1994-99 and 2001-04) Lippi won the Champions League, five Serie A titles, the Coppa Italia, Superopa Italiana, European Super Cup and Intercontinental Cup. He also won the Serie A Coach of the Year three times while in charge of the The Old Lady. Lippi will become technical director of Guangzhou Evergrande, the team he has been managing since 2012 . Lippi won five Serie A titles with Juventus as well as the Champions League and Coppa Italia and Supercopa .

"Newcastle should appoint Steve McClaren as their new manager to replace Alan Pardew, according to former defender Darren Peacock. McClaren is currently in charge of Derby, who sit fourth in the Championship, six points of top side Bournemouth. But while Peacock thinks Newcastle owner Mike Ashley should be looking to bring in the former England manager, he admits Ashley may be put off by possible compensation negotiations with Derby. Steve McClaren has done well during his time at Derby, and Darren Peacock would like him at Newcastle . Owner Mike Ashley is unlikely to want to pay too much money in compensation to secure a new manager . 'McClaren for me sticks out,' Peacock told talkSport. 'He's so experienced and he's a great coach as well. I would certainly look at him.' 'To be honest, I feel he won't go after anybody that he has to pay compensation. I think it's going to be really interesting, his next more. 'I think it'll give an indication for his intentions for the club. Most probably he'll bring John Carver in, and if John does a good job he's most probably going to stick with him. Alan Pardew left the club amicably on Tuesday after agreeing a deal with Crystal Palace . Peacock (right), who played for Newcastle for four years in the 1990s, scores against Manchester United . With club captain Fabriccio Coloccini one of the men linked to the job, Peacock is adamant that Ashley should go for a more seasoned manager. 'I think they need experience at the moment,' he added. 'They're in a decent position, they're in a comfortable position, but that can soon change. 'Over the Christmas period and New Year, there's a lot of games. The Cup is also important to the club, so they need to stick together.'","Steve McClaren is currently in fourth place with Derby in the Championship .

With a name like Double Take and a song called Hot Problems, you might already have guessed they think highly of themselves. But two wannabe pop princesses could well find themselves propelled into a storm of Samantha Brick proportions after releasing a music video bemoaning all the downsides of being beautiful. In it, the teenagers, aka Drew and Lauren, gesture flirtatiously in the back of a limousine while recounting all the obstacles they encounter with men and other girls because of their looks. Scroll down for the music video . 'We're hot!': Pop duo Double Take in their music video Hot Problems in which they lament the negatives of being pretty . Controversial: The girls giggle and gesture flirtatiously at the camera. The song has attracted more than 60,000 'dislikes' on YouTube in just five days . Lamenting (out of tune) over a rather dodgy . electro-pop backing track, they proclaim: 'Hot girls we have problems, . too. We're just like you, except we're hot.' Other lines include: 'Please don't get me wrong. I know I'm hot, but textbook perfection really takes a lot. 'Weird guys calls my phone and girls call names... but I can't be tamed.' The song is at serious risk of splitting opinion as ferociously as Mrs Brick did when she claimed in a Daily Mail article earlier this month that women loathed her for being too attractive. She said: 'There are downsides to being pretty — the main one being that other women hate me for no other reason than my lovely looks.' 'Downsides to being pretty': Double Take risk splitting opinion as journalist Samantha Brick (above) did when she wrote how women hated her because of her 'lovely looks' Her initial story attracted 1.6million hits - and thousands of vitriolic insults - on MailOnline, rising to 2.7million when you include her follow-up article defending her stance. In a similar brewing storm, the 'Hot Problems' video has been watched more than a million times on YouTube, but has received more than 60,000 'dislikes' compared to just 4,800 'likes'. One poster pleaded: 'Please shoot my ears off.' As if anticipating the resultant backlash, the production company, Old Bailey Productions, made sure to distance itself from the video. 'Old Bailey Productions did not create any of the audio or lyrics for this video,' it stated in the description. 'We produced the video as a favor.' From an 'artistic' point of view, many are also making derogatory comparisons to Rebecca Black's widely slated flop Friday which was dubbed possibly the 'worst video of all time' last year. Worst-ever? Double Take's video is already attracting derogatory comparisons to Rebecca Black's Friday (above) which was heavily slammed last year . It is not entirely clear whether the high school pair, who have not revealed their surnames, are merely being tongue in cheek, but they have said they created the video 'just for fun'. 'It was just have something we could share with our friends,' Drew said in an interview with MTV.com. 'We enjoy writing funny lyrics and songs and we decided that we really liked this one. I think that hopefully there could be a future with it.' Lauren added: 'I don't think we're going to be the next Adele, but we do really like writing songs and coming up with lyrics. Who knows?

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Miners at a South African platinum operation where 34 co-workers were killed in a clash with police will end their strike after a wage agreement was reached, officials said Tuesday. Work at the mine will resume Thursday. Zolisa Bodlani, one of the striking miners' representatives, and the National Union of Mineworkers said the workers have accepted the Lonmin mining company's offer of about 9,000 rand (about $1,084) a month for general minimum wage workers and about 11,000 rand (about $1,325) a month for rock drill operators. According to Lonmin's final offer, the total guaranteed pay represents increases of between 11% and 22% more than the miners' pre-strike pay packages, including wages and benefits such as housing allowances and medical aid. The settlement was signed in Rustenburg late Tuesday. Police opened fire on protesters at the Marikana mine last month. South African authorities at first charged 270 miners with murder before dropping the charges pending further investigation. Lonmin said workers also will get a 2,000-rand (about $243) signing bonus. ""These have been difficult and tragic weeks for everyone involved with the company, the communities living around our operations and the South African nation as a whole,"" acting Chief Executive Simon Scott said in a statement. ""Tonight's agreement and the subsequent return to work is only one step in a long and difficult process which lies ahead for everyone who has been affected by the events at Marikana, but it is essential in helping secure the futures of our tens of thousands of employees and all those who rely on Lonmin in the region."" South Africa has witnessed a vicious rivalry between two unions -- the dominant and established National Union of Mineworkers and the splinter Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union, which has been encroaching on the former's role. The National Union of Mineworkers is a close ally of the country's ruling African National Congress (ANC). The striking miners, according to several South African media outlets, felt they not been adequately represented by the battling unions. Political analyst Khehla Shubane said the power of the ANC is perceived to rest on the power of unions. ""No longer will the view that unions will continue to support the ANC uncritically be supported by evidence on the ground,"" Shubane told CNN on Tuesday.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Water with trace amounts of radioactivity may have leaked for months from a U.S. Navy nuclear-powered submarine as it traveled around the Pacific to ports in Guam, Japan and Hawaii, Navy officials told CNN on Friday. The USS Houston arrives in Pearl Harbor for routine maintenance, during which the leak was found. The leak was found on the USS Houston, a Los Angeles-class fast attack submarine, after it went to Hawaii for routine maintenance last month, Navy officials said. Navy officials said the amount of radiation leaked into the water was virtually undetectable. But the Navy alerted the Japanese government because the submarine had been docked in Japan. The problem was discovered last month when a build-up of leaking water popped a covered valve and poured onto a sailor's leg while the submarine was in dry dock. An investigation found a valve was slowly dripping water from the sub's nuclear power plant. The water had not been in direct contact with the nuclear reactor, Navy officials said. Officials with knowledge of the incident could not quantify the amount of radiation leaked but insisted it was ""negligible"" and an ""extremely low level."" The total amount leaked while the sub was in port in Guam, Japan and Hawaii was less than a half of a microcurie (0.0000005 curies), or less than what is found in a 50-pound bag of lawn and garden fertilizer, the officials said. The sailor who was doused, a Houston crew member, tested negative for radiation from the water, according to Navy officials. Since March, the Houston had crisscrossed the western Pacific, spending a week in Japan and several weeks in both Guam and Hawaii, Navy officials said.  See a timeline of the sub's movements » . The Navy on Friday notified the Japanese government of the leak, the officials said, and told them it was possible the ship had been leaking while in port in Sasebo, Japan, in March. While Japan has agreed to allow U.S. nuclear-powered ships in Japanese ports, the decision was a not popular in Japan. The Houston incident comes at a time when the Navy is trying to smooth over a problem with a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. The USS George Washington was due to replace the aging, conventionally powered USS Kitty Hawk this summer as the United States' sole carrier based in Japan. While en route to Japan this May, a massive fire broke out on the George Washington, causing $70 million in damage. The fire was blamed on crew members smoking near improperly stored flammable materials. There was no damage or threat to the nuclear reactor, but the ship was diverted to San Diego, California, for repairs. It now is expected to arrive in Japan at the end of September. The Navy this week fired the captain and his deputy, saying an investigation into the fire led to a lack of confidence in the leadership of both men. Just two weeks ago, thousands of Japanese protested the pending arrival of the George Washington.","Leak was found on the USS Houston during routine maintenance last month .

The sport involves fighting in ‘cages’ – round cushioned floors which are surrounded by plastic and metal fencing. Training: Reyaad Khan (left) chose to prepare himself by practising mixed martial arts at his local gym in Cardiff . Last night Henry Saye, head coach at the £30-a-month gym, said Khan was short and podgy as a teenager. But Mr Saye said he was ‘in good shape’ when he last saw him – just weeks before he left Britain with his friend, 20-year-old Nasser Muthana, who reportedly also took part in MMA sessions. The 34-year-old trainer, who works at the Brotherhood gym near  Khan’s Cardiff home, believes he was radicalised a year before he left Britain. He said: ‘He suddenly changed. On Facebook, he started ranting about the US and the way that the West treated Muslims. He hadn’t been like that before. Almost overnight, he became a reactionary.’ The detail of Khan's training was revealed as it emerged President Obama has sent a special unit of CIA officers to the UK to investigate British Muslim extremists. Head coach Henry Saye said Khan (circled) was short and podgy as a teenager but was recently in good shape . The unusual move has been made amid growing fears in Washington that we are becoming a ‘breeding ground’ for terrorism. In a pointed snub to MI5, the agents arrived on a ‘lone wolf’ mission to interrogate senior security experts about the radicalisation of UK Muslims.

The Vatican's semi-official newspaper has angered supporters of euthanasia and abortions by suggesting they apply the same justifications that were used by the Nazis to . champion their murderous eugenics programme. The controversial claim that they believe in the survival of the fittest concept, was made in an article on the front page of today's issue of L'Osservatore RomanO. It was published in response to the recent Italian translation of a 1920 book  titled Allowing the Destruction of Life Unworthy of Living, by two German scholars, Karl Binding and Alfred Hoche. Bold claims: Pope Benedict XVI arrives to meet Albania's President Bamir Topi during a private audience at the Vatican earlier today . It is written by Lucetta Scaraffia, an Italian historian who frequently has work published in the Vatican paper, reports the Huffington Post. 'Contempt for imperfect human life, over . estimation of the abilities of science' are 'still firmly present in . our time,' she states. Response: Her article was in response to the recent Italian translation of a 1920 book by two German scholars, Karl Binding, pictured, and Alfred Hoche . The book she is discussing set the agenda for the Nazi programme of extermination -  they believed that select people did not have the right to survive, such as disabled or terminally ill patients. It promotes the idea that people who are seriously or terminally ill or have a mental or physical disability were 'unworthy of being lived,' and should be given a 'charitable death.' In the article Scaraffia argues that this viewpoint on whether a life should be ended is present in the 'writings of many contemporary bioethicists, and . of many politicians who support legislative proposals of a euthanastic . type.' The historian asserts that the book is 'sinisterly' relevant to current debates. She . writes that it should 'strongly embarrass those who champion euthanasia . in the belief that it has nothing to do with Nazism,' reports the Huffington Post. Controversial link: Her claims are controversial as many pro-choice campaigners who support assisted suicide and abortions may object to Scaraffia comparing them to a regime which was responsible for the death of millions of people during World War Two . Another bold claim is that 'eugenics is still alive and has not been wiped out together with the Nazi past.'

"(CNN) -- He was a Formula One driver who transcended his sport and even 20 years after his death, Ayrton Senna commands the adoration of fans across the world. This week marks the anniversary of the crash at the Imola Circuit in Italy which took the life of the Brazilian driver, just 24 hours after Austria's Roland Ratzenberger had suffered the same fate. Tributes have poured in for both drivers, with a memorial service held at the track which claimed the lives of both men on Thursday. A collection of motorsport legends past and present were in attendance, where a minute's silence was observed at 14:17 local time -- the exact time of Senna's accident two decades earlier. Fans paid their own tributes to Senna, with many laying floral tributes at the feet of the bronze statue of the triple world champion which sits near the section of the track where he crashed. Senna's passing was the last time a driver has died as a result of a crash at a grand prix, in a sport which in its formative decades had become infamous for driver fatalities. ""Senna was very important for Formula One, as a driver and a person and his death led to a rapid acceleration in the process of increasing the level of safety in our sport,"" Ferrari driver Kimi Raikkonen told the sport's official website. ""That has avoided other tragedies from occurring. Unfortunately however, one cannot change the past, neither for Ayrton nor for Roland Ratzenberger. ""The only thing we can do is remember this champion, whose exploits defined the history of Formula One for a long time."" The Imola Circuit will be open until Sunday for the public to pay their respects to the drivers. In Brazil, Senna's grave in the city of Sao Paulo was adorned with wreaths and bright bouquets. He was laid to rest in the Morumbi Cemetery. Senna's sister Viviane, unveiled an Azul Brazilian airline aircraft with the colors of Senna's iconic yellow helmet on its nose. Vivianne is the head of the Ayrton Senna Institute, which partners with major corporations to give educational opportunities to millions of children across Brazil. Brazilian football team Corinthians paid tribute to one of the country's most famous sporting icons by walking out onto the pitch in replicas of Senna's brightly-colored helmet ahead of Wednesday's match against National AM.","The 20th anniversary of the death of Ayrton Senna marked across the world .

"(CNN) -- It didn't take Maria Sharapova long to find a new coach. Two days after announcing she was ending her successful three-year partnership with Thomas Hogstedt, Sharapova said former great Jimmy Connors will be Hogstedt's successor. ""I have known Jimmy for many years and we briefly worked together in 2008 just before the Australian Open,"" Sharapova told her website. ""I am really excited about our new partnership and looking forward to the upcoming tournaments."" The coaching shuffle comes about two weeks after the U.S.-based Russian was upset by qualifier Michelle Larcher de Brito in the second round at Wimbledon. ""Due to personal issues, (Hogstedt) was not able to travel in the near future and we both agreed it was the right time to move our separate ways,"" the world No. 2 had said. ""I am very thankful for all his work and wish him much success in the future."" Connors won eight grand slam titles. Like Sharapova, he was a steely competitor who never gave an inch. Some of his most memorable battles came against fellow American John McEnroe. Connors' backhand is regarded as one of the best ever. When his playing days were over, Connors kept a relatively low profile and mostly stayed away from tennis circles. That changed when he decided to work with a slumping Andy Roddick in 2006. The move paid instant dividends for Roddick, as he reached the U.S. Open final two months later. Their association lasted two years, with Roddick saying he resigned. Connors' autobiography was released earlier this year. It was under Hogstedt, a former touring pro from Sweden, that Sharapova completed her grand slam collection last year at the French Open. The victory was sweeter for Sharapova because it was her first grand slam title after a shoulder injury that derailed her career. She lost to Serena Williams in the final of this year's French. Sharapova's movement noticeably improved under Hogstedt -- adding to her fierce ground strokes and intense desire to win. But their last tournament together didn't go as planned, with Sharapova slipping twice on the grass at Wimbledon against Larcher de Brito and suffering her earliest grand slam exit in three years. The loss, however, allowed Sharapova to watch the end of boyfriend Grigor Dimitrov's marathon five-set loss to Grega Zemlja. Hogstedt left Li Na to work with Sharapova at the end of 2010, with the Chinese baseliner then reaching the final at the Australian Open while Sharapova crashed out in the fourth round. Li, the French Open winner in 2011, has the same agent as Sharapova in Max Eisenbud. Sharapova formerly worked with Michael Joyce and her father, Yuri. Earlier this week, another former No. 1, Ana Ivanovic, severed ties with Nigel Sears, the father of Andy Murray's girlfriend.","Maria Sharapova hires Jimmy Connors as new coach after splitting with Thomas Hogstedt .

"For many women, a Carrie Bradshaw closet would be a dream come true. But without one, dressing for a special occasion can be a girl's nightmare. Smart Business meets Abby and Shan Shan, co-founders of Hong Kong company Yeechoo, who are hoping to solve the age old dilemma of having nothing to wear. CNN: What was the idea behind starting Yeechoo.com? Abby: You know us girls, we are always facing the issue that we have a whole closet of clothes, of dresses, but that we still don't know what to wear. With Yeechoo, this is like your best friend's closet - you dont have to spend thousands of dollars to buy a dress you're only going to wear once or twice. CNN: Yeechoo functions as a shared closet focusing on variety over ownership. How does that work? Shan Shan: What we found is a girl would only wear a dress maximum of five to six times, and on average only twice or three times before they get forgotten. That's why we think the cost per wear is just too high to justify the high price tag for the designer dresses. We always say you can spend $10,000 on one dress, or $10,000 for ten different dresses. CNN: How do you keep up with the variety of women's sartorial tastes worldwide? S:  We always need to expand our styles that fit different bodies because all the girls have different tastes and different needs. CNN: Which markets have been the most receptive to Yeechoo? A: Asia's not very into second hand clothing, it's unlike US or Europe. People are very conservative, and they'd rather chose fast fashion over secondhand clothing, so the challenge is to educate our customers, too. CNN: What kind of effect do you hope the company will have on the fashion industry? A: At the moment, only a very small fraction of people can have access to a luxury good, to designer brands, because of their high price. But Yeechoo made a change, and has made a disruptive entry here. we are democratizing the fashion industry, and making it accessible to the mass market.","In Hong Kong, fashion rental site Yeechoo hopes to transform how we approach evening wear .

"There have been times in Jose Mourinho’s career when he has shown what a sentimental old fool he can be. He is a romantic at heart. This was the official homecoming for Didier Drogba, the first time Chelsea’s supporters have seen him in their Champions League jersey since that incredible night in the Allianz Arena. After starting this game, he was blowing heavily for most of it in his struggle to recapture past glories. At 36, it is too much to ask. Chelsea striker Didier Drogba jumps over Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Fahrmann . Two years ago, when Chelsea went on to win the Champions League, Drogba was the main man. He was king in these parts, then. That night, he summoned superhuman powers to score their equaliser against Bayern Munich in the 88th minute and went on to strike the winning penalty in the shootout. On Wednesday night, as Chelsea fans heartily sang Diego Costa’s name after he was brought on with Loic Remy in an attempt to snatch victory, it felt like the endgame for Drogba. Drogba joins in the celebrations for Cesc Fabregas' opening goal against Schalke . Stamford Bridge had been willing him to score, but those legs could not carry him to the places his razor-sharp mind wanted to go. There were chances in each half as he attempted to add to the 34 Chelsea goals he has scored in this competition. The first was nicked off his toes for a corner. After the break, Eden Hazard, Chelsea’s outstanding player in an ordinary performance, set him clear of Schalke’s defence. He beat keeper Ralf Fahrmann, but rolled his effort wide. Then there was the ‘Gazza moment’, sliding in like the England midfielder at Euro 96, when Willian crossed from the right. He, like Gascoigne, failed to connect. ‘I was happy with Drogba’s performance,’ insisted Mourinho. ‘One inch is nothing, that is all. He could have scored.’ Drogs backs Chelsea captain John Terry as he protests against his booking for kicking the ball away . To judge Drogba on one start would be ridiculous, but the fact Mourinho reached for Costa and Remy 17 minutes from time said it all. Chelsea’s manager always looks out for his favourites. When Inter Milan were 2-0 up with four minutes to play in the 2010 Champions League final, Mourinho sent on Marco Materazzi as a substitute. It was the Italian’s reward for his loyalty during Mourinho’s final season at San Siro. This was another emotional decision by Mourinho ahead of Sunday’s game at Manchester City. Costa’s place for that is nailed on. Drogba makes way for Diego Costa during Wednesday's 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge . Drogba was on his own up front, ahead of the playground footballers — Hazard, Willian and Cesc Fabregas — who provide the attacking thrust. They have younger legs and danced around Schalke in a dizzy opening spell. There were flashes from Drogba, the silky touches that once turned this guy into one of the dangerous strikers in Europe. The neat header to Fabregas, from a long ball by John Terry, was the Drogba of old. So was the backchat with Hazard, after he took the ball off his toes when he should have peeled off him. When he was replaced by Costa, the chants were for the new man in town. Undeniably, they have replaced an old favourite here.","Didier Droga made first appearance in Champions League jersey for Chelsea since 2012 triumph .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . London's landscape has featured in countless images over the years but none can evoke what it's really like to be among the bustling crowds of the city centre, or to sit under the trees in Regents Park. To try and capture the unique sounds of the city, archivist Ian Rawes has created the London Sound Survey - an online collection of field recordings, sound maps, early BBC radio actuality and more. As part of this project, Rawes travelled London's canals and rivers during during 2011 and 2012 recording ambient sounds along the way and has plotted these on his Underground-inspired Waterways map. Click the image below to listen to the original recordings (opens in a new tab) Rawes travelled along Regents Canal, Grand Union canal, Beverly Brook and more. Each waterway was assigned a colour from the London Underground map . Although the map follows London’s . canals and smaller rivers, noises from other landmarks including the M4 . bridge, London Zoo and Victoria Park are also featured. The recordings are grouped together based by location and tube lines. To . use the map, click a placeholder name to listen to the recording. As . the recording plays, the file details are shown above the map. These . details include how long the clip is, the date and time it was . recorded, the location and a brief description about what can be heard. Click play to listen to the sounds of Little Venice, the M4 bridge and London Zoo . To listen to a recording, users can click a placeholder name, such as Little Venice, pictured left, to listen to the ambient sounds around that location. The recording of Little Venice, stock image pictured right, was recorded on 15 July 2011 at 6.15am and features a narrowboat's propeller churning through the water . For . example, the Victoria Park recording was taken on 9 July 2011 at 11am. It was recorded by Regent's Canal at Victoria Park, Hackney, in east . London and includes ‘loud birdsong from nearby trees and buddleia . bushes, traffic in background, a bicycle passes making a noise on loose . concrete paving slabs.’ Rawes travelled along canals, brooks and more. Each waterway has been assigned a colour from the London Underground map . ‘Listening . to a recording of the sounds of a place or event gets the imagination . working and recreates some of the sense of being there,’ explained . Rawes. ‘It feels like a worthwhile end in itself simply to share those experiences with whoever's willing to listen.’ Ian Rawes got the idea for the project while working at the British Library Sound Archives. Describing why he feels sound is the best way to document the city, Rawes told Ear Room: ‘I’d lived away from London for about ten years and found it hard to settle for a while when I moved back. 'London struck me as very anonymous and indifferent. Literary attempts to describe the city as an organism or having some sort of enduring spirit just seemed fanciful.’ Rawes admitted that the Thames is one of his favourite places because ‘you get a mixture of industry, scraps of marshland, housing, and seemingly un-owned bits of land which are used for scrambler bikes and clay-pigeon shooting’, along with Brixton that has a ‘wide array of soundscapes because it’s the pole star of Caribbean culture in London and there are several indoor and street markets.' The recordings are grouped based on where they were taken. For example, locations along the River Lea, pictured, are shown along the green line, which would traditionally represent the District Line on the original tube map .","London Sound Survey was set up by sound archivist Ian Rawes .

"Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew says £1.5million bargain-buy striker Ayoze Perez has more natural technical ability than his former players Carlos Tevez, Teddy Sheringham and Dean Ashton. Perez, 21, has already scored four goals in his debut season in England after signing from Spanish Second Division club Tenerife. The Spaniard is expected to lead the line against Everton on Sunday after catching the eye of Sir Alex Ferguson against Manchester United on Boxing Day, and Pardew, who had some great attacking talent at his disposal at West Ham, predicts a glittering future for the Spaniard. Ayoze Perez carried a threat for Newcastle United in their Boxing Day defeat at Man United . Sir Alex Ferguson, the former Man United manager, was impressed by Perez's performance at Old Trafford . Newcastle (4-2-3-1): Alnwick; Janmaat, S Taylor, Coloccini, Dummett; Colback, Tiote; Gouffran, Sissoko, Ameobi; Perez . ‘He has surprised me at how good he has been. He is a real talent,’ said Pardew. ‘I have been fortunate to work with some really good strikers. I think of Tevez, Sheringham, Dean Ashton, and he has got faster feet than all three of them. ‘And the work ethic he has put in for the team as well, if he progresses like he is, we don’t know where he’ll end up. ‘I was lucky enough to have a quick glass of wine with Sir Alex [on Boxing Day] and he caught his eye.’ Newcastle manager Alan Pardew commended the work ethic and pace of Spain Under 21 star Perez . Pardew will want to arrest a run of four successive defeats when Everton visit St James' on Sunday . The comparison with Tevez is a real boost to Perez given that the Argentine forward has played for some of the biggest clubs in Europe including Manchester United, Manchester City and Juventus, and scored for his country at the World Cup. Barcelona and Real Madrid had been interested in signing the Spain Under-21 forward before Newcastle moved to bring him to Tyneside last June. And Pardew reflected: ‘He won player of the year last season in the Spanish Second Division, so it’s not a complete mystery. ‘But we worked hard on his signature and worked hard on his family to give him the platform that we would give him an opportunity. Perez rues a missed opportunity during last weekend's Tyne-Wear derby defeat to Sunderland . Newcastle's teenage striker Adam Armstrong (right) tussles with Man United defender Paddy McNair . ‘We put a lot of physical work into him. It’s not bulk he needs, because agility is a massive part of his game, it’s just body strength and he has that,’ said Pardew. Pardew is also cheered by the emergence of Newcastle’s academy players Paul Dummett, Rolando Aarons and Adam Armstrong, the 17-year-old who started his first top-flight match on Boxing Day. The Newcastle boss added: ‘I genuinely think that with Dummett, Aarons, Armstrong and Perez, we have four really outstanding young players and that is very, very difficult to get through at a Premier League club.’","Ayoze Perez was impressive for Newcastle in Man United defeat .

"By . Andrew Levy . PUBLISHED: . 19:40 EST, 25 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:47 EST, 25 January 2013 . Grandmother Patricia Barden (pictured here in an old image), 77, who died after falling into a cesspit in her garden . A grandmother drowned after falling into a 14ft-deep cesspit in her garden. Patricia Barden, 77, was walking outside her house when a rusty manhole cover gave way beneath her. She plunged into the cesspit, which was two-thirds full, and would have been unable to climb up its smooth sides. Police who were called to the home found her shoes nearby and told an inquest she may have hurled them out in a desperate attempt to attract help. It is not clear how long she survived but nearly four days elapsed between the last time someone spoke to her and when her body was found at the detached £450,000 property in Milden, near Ipswich. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Dr Dan Sharpstone, assistant deputy coroner for Suffolk, said: ‘The metal cover and brickwork was in a poor state... it was described as a death trap. ‘Mrs Barden fell into the cesspit and we have heard there was no feasible way of getting out. Tragically, she drowned.’ Widow Mrs Barden had lived alone since her husband, Charles, died in 1994. Her daily routine involved getting up at 7.30am and having a walk and a cup of tea in her beloved garden. Suffolk Police were called to the house at 1am on July 2 last year after a concerned family member said they were unable to get in contact with her. They were let in by her step-granddaughter, Charlotte Rush, who drove up from Kent with a set of keys. The doors were locked and there was no sign of trouble but an officer made the grim discovery in the garden. Detective Inspector David Giles told the inquest in Bury St Edmunds: ‘An officer noticed an open manhole and, with the use of a torchlight, saw what was believed to be a body in the bottom of the pit, in the water. Suffolk Police were first called to the house at 1am on July 2 last year to find all the doors locked and no sign of any trouble . ‘We concluded that somehow she had . fallen in. The access to the cesspit was heavily corroded. I think at . some point she stood on the cover and it has given way as there is no . strength there. If you had gone in there, you wouldn’t have been able to . get out without any assistance. We will never know exactly the day that . she fell or how long she was in there.’ Mrs Barden’s body was removed by firefighters on July 3 and she was pronounced dead by a paramedic. 'She . lived her life to the full and we are all extremely sad that she is no . longer with us,' - Step-granddaughter Charlotte Rush . A post mortem examination  confirmed . the cause of death was drowning. Receipts showed she went to a . supermarket in Sudbury on June 27 last year and Miss Rush’s cousin spoke . to her the following day. An inspection by a drain inspector revealed . the fragile state of the manhole cover and that the surrounding . brickwork and concrete was so corroded it could barely support its . weight. Reading a statement submitted by Miss . Rush, Dr Sharpeston said: ‘Her step-grandmother was an active person who . drove to local towns and had a nice life.’ Residents near Mrs Barden’s home paid . tribute to her as a ‘pillar of the community’ who was ‘articulate’ and . ‘well-presented’. She held numerous fundraising events including coffee . mornings and bazaars for her local church, St Peter’s. Speaking after the inquest, Miss Rush, . 30, said: ‘My beloved nan, Patricia, was the best nan in the world. She . lived her life to the full and we are all extremely sad that she is no . longer with us.’","Patricia Barden fell into a 14ft garden cesspit after manhole gave way .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- A series of small bombs went off in and around a world-famous Buddhist temple in eastern India Sunday, injuring two people, authorities said. Four of the eight explosions occurred at the Mahabodhi temple complex, a UNESCO World Heritage site in Bihar state that houses a tree where Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment. The temple itself was not damaged. The other four blasts hit other sacred locations around Mahabodhi, said Bihar police official S.K. Bhardwaj. A 50-year-old Tibetan and a 30-year-old Myanmar national were injured in the attack, Bhardwaj said. While no one took responsibility for the attack, suspicion fell on the home-grown Islamist group Indian Mujahideen, Bhardwaj said. The group, designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department, is blamed for dozens of deadly bomb explosions throughout India since 2005.","Four of the eight explosions take place at the Mahabodi complex .

"A Christian ministry's long-stalled plans to build Noah's Ark in the hills of Kentucky have been revived. Creation Museum founder Ken Ham announced Thursday that a municipal bond offering has raised enough money to begin construction on the Ark Encounter project, estimated to cost about $73 million. Groundbreaking is planned for May and the ark is expected to be finished by the summer of 2016. Ham said a high-profile evolution debate he had with 'Science Guy' Bill Nye on February 4 helped boost support for the project. Creationist: Ken Ham, founder of the nonprofit ministry Answers in Genesis, poses with one of his favorite animatronic dinosaurs during a tour of the Creation Museum in Petersburg . Nye said he was 'heartbroken and sickened for the Commonwealth of Kentucky' after learning that the project would move forward. He said the ark would eventually draw more attention to the beliefs of Ham's ministry, which preaches that the Bible's creation story is a true account, and as a result, 'voters and taxpayers in Kentucky will eventually see that this is not in their best interest.' Ham's Answers in Genesis ministry and the Creation Museum enjoyed an avalanche of news media attention during the debate, which focused on science and the Bible's explanations of the origins of the universe. Answers in Genesis unveiled the proposal in 2010 for a $150 million theme park that would include the ark. But private donations to the project did not keep pace with the construction timeline, forcing its backers to delay the ark's construction and divide the park development into phases. The bonds were offered last year by the city of Williamstown, site of the planned ark about 40 miles south of Cincinnati. Message: Ken Ham's ministry pushes a literal interpretation of the Bible's creation story . Debate: Creation Museum head Ken Ham (right)  speaks during a debate on evolution with TV's 'Science Guy' Bill Nye, at the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky . Ham said the bond issue faced many . obstacles, including what he called misleading news media reports and . attempts by opponents to disrupt the bond offering. Ham . would not disclose the total amount of bond funds raised because of . underwriter restrictions. But a December bond document describing the . project listed the amount at $62 million. Mark Looy, a vice president . with Answers in Genesis, said the figure is less than $62 million, and . that the minimum funding requirement was achieved. Nye . brushed off a question about whether he might be criticized for taking . part in a debate that boosted fundraising for the ark. New exhibit: People enter and exit the new Creation Museum in Petersburg, where an ark will soon be built . 'Me? I've always been criticized,' he said. The bonds are to be repaid through revenue from the park, and the city is not liable for the money, according to bond documents. The . wooden ark would have old-world details, such as wooden pegs instead of . nails, straight-sawed timbers and plenty of animals - some alive, some . robotic.

"Accra, Ghana (CNN) -- Ten people were killed Saturday after a cargo plane crashed through a fence surrounding an airport in Accra, Ghana, and slammed into a bus, municipal and national officials said. The Boeing 727 cargo plane -- operated by the Nigerian-based Allied Air company -- touched down around 7 p.m. Saturday on a runway at Accra's Kotoka International Airport but was not able to stop, officials said. ""The cargo plane ... shot the runway, broke through a wall and (that) resulted in the death of 10 people who were traveling on a commercial vehicle,"" Deputy Transport Minister Dzifa Attivor said. There were no survivors aboard the mangled mini-bus, officials said. By 10 p.m., those killed had been put in body bags and moved from the scene, which was crowded with emergency, security and government officials. As to the crew of the cargo plane, which took off earlier in the day from Lagos, they were transported to a local hospital for treatment, said Attivor. Their airliner was lying across the road from the airport, on a parcel of land abutting an Accra football stadium. Its wings and nose were severely damaged, while its tailfin had broken off. It was raining in Accra at the time of the crash.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Fox 29 anchor Kerry Barrett has welcomed her first son into the world, following several tragic miscarriages. John Jay Barrett IV was born over the weekend and weighed a healthy 6lbs 15oz. He is Mrs Barrett's second child with husband of 11 years, John, a pilot with New Jersey National Guard, following three-year-old daughter Avery. Scroll down for video . Happy ending: Fox news anchor Kerry Barrett (left) welcomed little John Jay Barrett IV (right) into the world over the weekend, weighing in at 6lbs 15oz, following several tragic miscarriages . Last November, after much anguish, Mrs . Barrett broke her silence on the evening news and spoke of suffering . repeated miscarriages - four of which she detailed. 'For most of the last year and a half - I've been pregnant, and miscarried every single time,' she revealed to Fox News. Her second miscarriage started just half an hour before she was due to go on air for the 10 'o clock news, and none of her colleagues knew she was pregnant, so stoically, Mrs Barrett went on with the show. She lost the baby at home later that night. Now there are four! Husband John Barrett (left) and Mrs Barrett (right) now have a son to join their three-year-old daughter Avery (center) 'You have the first and then the second . and now we are in phase where maybe we aren't able to have [more] kids,' her husband admitted at the time. The couple, heartbroken but determined not to give up, sought help from Dr Scott Edwards, a fertility specialist at Pennsylvania Hospital. No abnormalities were detected and both parents were found to be healthy and normal, news Mrs Barrett found 'difficult to wrap her head around'. The hopeful mother was put on a course of drugs to hyper-stimulate her ovaries, and immediately fell pregnant again - this time with twins. Heartbreak: Mrs Barrett went public with her struggles last November on an evening news special, speaking of her repeated miscarriages over the space of a year and a half . Raw: The new mother started having her second miscarriage just before going on air for her 10 'o clock news segment, which she finished, before losing her baby at home later that night . When the first ultrasound found the . embryos to be on the small side, Mrs Barrett admitted that she felt . somehow responsible. Hypothesizing it was because she hadn't been eating . enough, she drastically upped her food intake. 'I stuffed myself thinking it was my fault that the babies weren't growing,' she revealed. 'And then when we went back the next week, they hadn't grown anymore and the heartbeats had stopped.' This time, she had to have the fetuses surgically removed, and subsequent tests showed the babies had a relatively common chromosomal abnormality called Triosomy 18. Marriage strain: Mrs Benett admitted there were times during this awful period where she and her husband were having 'the worst fights' they had ever had . Happy family: The couple describe little Avery (pictured as a toddler) as 'our most exciting adventure, our biggest teacher and our greatest accomplishment' Months of spending 'far too much money' on various supplements and forms of acupuncture followed, and hours . spent in the middle of the night crawling the internet for more answers. She admits that the repeated the blows put an enormous strain on her marriage, recalling some of the 'worst fights' they had ever had; Mr Barrett finding it hard to watch his wife in so much pain, and Mrs Barrett feeling completely out of control of her body. Dr Edwards assured them that even following several miscarriages, there can still be a '50, 60, 70 per cent' chance of success in the future - and he was right. In August of last year, Mrs Barrett got pregnant again and this time carried the baby to full term.

"Ray Cole, pictured, was detained by Moroccan authorities after he travelled to the country to meet his Facebook friend Jamal Jam Wald Naas . A British holidaymaker jailed in Morocco for being gay has had the charges he faced formally dropped following his return home to the UK. Ray Cole, 70, was imprisoned for four months with his Moroccan friend Jamal Jam Wald Nass after homosexual images were found on his phone. The pair were left languishing in a crowded Marrakesh jail described as a 'concentration camp', but were eventually granted a conditional release. Now Mr Cole has disclosed that the charges the pair faced have been formally dropped by the Moroccan authorities. In a Facebook message to his supporters, Mr Cole, from Deal, Kent, said they could now 'put this horrible episode behind us'. He added: 'Happy though I am for this, it doesn't take away the memory of the appalling treatment in the police station and the frightening conditions in the prison. 'The overwhelming feeling of fear and isolation will stay with me for the rest of my life, I think. 'Even though I was held for just three weeks, at the time I had no idea of when I would get out and see my loved ones again. It seemed like an eternity, and all for what? Nothing! 'Just because I'm a gay man. And because they could! There are no winners. Morocco's reputation as a safe holiday destination was shattered and inquiries dropped by around 50 per cent, although it will recover. 'And it cost me in the region of £7,000 personally. So that's my travelling days finished! So I'm happy that it's all over, but sorry that the Moroccan authorities haven't yet offered any apology or compensation. 'I'm not holding my breath.' Mr Cole, centre, returned to the UK last month where he was met by his family after his month-long ordeal . Mr Cole, left, was held in a cell along with 59 other men in an area designed just to hold just 44 . Mr Cole's son Adrian, 41, said the family were relieved to have finally gained a resolution and to now put the matter behind them. He said: 'We understand that this is the first time that anyone has had this type of effect on a Muslim society's judicial system.' The case generated huge interest on social media from supporters who urged the Moroccan authorities to free retired Mr Cole. As well as a petition, a Free Ray Cole hashtag circulated on Twitter and a Facebook page was set up calling for the release of Mr Cole, who has a minor heart condition. He struck up a friendship with Mr Nass, who is in his 20s, on Facebook. It was on Mr Cole's second visit to Morocco to see him that they were detained at a bus stop by officers. Mr Cole was four weeks into a five-week break in the north African country when the pair were held on September 18. Mr Cole and Mr Nass, were held for three weeks in the central prison in Marrakesh, pictured . Confusion initially reigned over where he was being held until he was eventually tracked down. On October 2 his family received a phone call telling them the pair had been jailed for four months. They had feared a six-month jail term as a worst-case scenario. He was kept in a cell intended for 44 men which was holding 60, forcing Mr Cole to sleep on the ground and live with dangerous prisoners. The Foreign Office website says homosexuality is a criminal offence in Morocco. It states: 'Sexual relations outside marriage are also punishable by law.' But Mr Cole's local MP, Conservative Charlie Elphicke, described the charges as 'medieval' and said it showed British tourists were not safe in Morocco. Former deputy speaker of the House of Commons Nigel Evans also attacked the 'archaic' law that sent Mr Cole to prison.","Ray Cole was in the final week of his trip to Morocco when he was jailed .

"(CNN) -- Top seed Dinara Safina battled from a set down to defeat Belarusian teenager Victoria Azarenka at the French Open, but there was no escape for scheduled semifinal opponent Maria Sharapova who suffered a humiliating exit. Sharapova bowed out of the French Open after suffering one of her worst career defeats. Sharapova was thrashed 6-0 6-2 by Slovakia's Dominika Cibulkova in her last-eight match on Tuesday while fellow Russian Safina overcame 19-year-old Azarenka 1-6 6-4 6-2. It could have worse for former world number one Sharapova as Cibulkova had a match point to mark her first Grand Slam quarterfinal by dishing out the dreaded double bagel. Sharapova survived and she saved three more match points in the 12th game of the second set before her resistance crumbled completely with a netted forehand. It was her heaviest loss since she went down 6-1 6-1 to Serena Williams in the fourth round in Miami in 2007. Sharapova, playing only her second tournament since a 10-month lay-off because of a shoulder injury, was bidding to reach her second semifinal following a run to the 2007 last four. The Russian star, whose ranking slumped to 104 in the world during her time off the tour, had won both her previous matches against the pint-sized, 20-year-old Cibulkova and both were on clay. But Cibulkova was in complete control, breaking in the first, third and fifth games of the opening set. The Slovakian was then quickly 1-0 ahead before receiving a code violation for taking too long between points. It did not throw her off her stride and she was soon flat out on the dirt surface of Court Suzanne Lenglen in celebration. Safina was given the runaround in the first set and was at one stage being held at 4-4 in the second, but recovered her poise on Philippe Chatrier court. Ninth seed Azarenka had beaten Safina at Indian Wells earlier this year and had also won three titles in 2009, in Brisbane, Memphis and Miami. She played an almost perfect first set in just 23 minutes, but Safina then found the form that had seen her lose just five games in her run to the quarters opening a 4-1 lead in the second. Azarenka fought back to make it 4-4 but Safina rallied again to take the set -- and break in the opening game of the third. World number one Safina, who has yet to win a grand slam, finished the stronger to wrap up victory in an hour and 52 minutes. ""I just didn't take the chances I had,"" said Azarenka. ""Shedefinitely stepped it up and played some good points at key moments, which I have to give her credit for. It's all experience. Hopefully I'll do better next time.""","Dinara Safina battles from set down to beat Victoria Azarenka at French Open .

She'd always say, ""I'm on tour right now, baby. But when we I get home, we'll go see Michael."" And one day we did, and he showed up, I think, in my living room or somewhere. King: You were writing a song at his death? Elliott: Yes. Actually, I was working on some music for the new record that I was going to get over to Jermaine. And the night before he passed away, it's crazy we were writing a song. King: How great a singer was Michael Jackson? Warwick: Michael was... King: A singer -- a pure singer? Warwick: And he could sing. Yes. Yes. It was more than the magic of everything else that he did. He was a brilliant singer. King: What was he like to work with, if you were working on a song together? What was that experience like? Elliott: Well, from a distance, I got to work with Michael.

"(CNN) -- Pakistan and India exchanged fire near the border in the disputed Kashmir region early Saturday, killing at least two people from each country. The Indian paramilitary border security force said Pakistani forces fired shots and mortar rounds near the border, killing a father and his 8-year-old son, and injuring four others, including a trooper. A spokesman for the security force called the action from the Pakistani side ""unprovoked."" The Pakistani military said an intermittent exchange of fire continues between the countries. It accused Indian troops of ""unprovoked"" opening fire on the working boundary near Sialkot, killing two civilians -- a woman and a 60-year-old man. The two nuclear-armed countries agreed to a bilateral ceasefire in November 2003. But while it has held well, it has suffered breaches since last year. The latest round of violence has triggered the dislocation of more than 1,000 border residents, an Indian official said. Kashmir has been in the throes of separatist violence since 1989; officials say it has claimed 42,000 lives, but rights groups and nongovernmental organizations put the number at twice that. Talks called off . The latest bloodshed comes amid recent diplomatic tensions. India called off talks planned for Monday with Islamabad after Pakistan's New Delhi-based high commissioner, Abdul Basit, invited Kashmiri separatist leaders for consultations ahead of the summit. The New Delhi foreign secretary told Basit ""in clear and unambiguous terms, that Pakistan's continued efforts to interfere in India's internal affairs were unacceptable,"" India's External Affairs Ministry said in a statement. ""The meetings with these so-called leaders of the Hurriyat undermines the constructive diplomatic engagement initiated by Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi in May on his very first day in office,"" the ministry said. But Pakistan said in a statement it is a ""longstanding practice"" to meet with Kashmiri leaders before India-Pakistani talks are held. ""The Indian decision is a setback to the efforts by our leadership to promote good neighborly relations with India. The prime minister of Pakistan has clearly articulated the vision of peace for development,"" the statement said. ""It seems a knee-jerk reaction,"" said Mirwaiz Moulvi Umar Farooq, a moderate Kashmiri separatist leader. ""We have been meeting the Pakistani officials, including the country's New Delhi-based high commissioner, for the past 20 years. I don't know what happened today. It is a backward step."" He said the move is short-sighted. ""The decision lacks political maturity and cannot be termed as far-sighted,"" he said. 'Not a good development' Hardline separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani described the decision as unfortunate, saying it proved that ""New Delhi was never serious to resolve Kashmir peacefully."" Even mainstream political parties have expressed dismay at the cancellation of the talks. ""It is not a good development. The separatists have been meeting Pakistani officials. They even met the then-Pakistan president, Pervez Musharraf,"" said Ali Mohammad Sagar, a senior ruling National Conference leader and minister. During his visit to Indian-administered Kashmir this month, Modi condemned ""the continued proxy war by neighboring Pakistan."" Addressing army officers and soldiers in the frontier Ladakh region bordering China and Pakistan, Modi said that ""the neighboring country has lost the strength to fight a conventional war but continues to engage in the proxy war of terrorism."" Modi's criticism of Islamabad came against in the backdrop of reported ceasefire violations by Pakistani troops on the border and increased militant attacks in Kashmir. CNN's Sophia Saifi reported from Islamabad and Journalist Mukhtar Ahmad reported from Srinagar.

"(CNN) -- A designer clothing store, a comic book store, a tattoo parlor and a ... women for sale store. This unusual window display shocked shoppers at a busy Tel Aviv mall last week when among the run-of-the-mill shops, they came across a group of young women standing in a storefront. On them were price tags detailing their age, weight, height, dimensions and country of origin. Organizers said the campaign is designed to bring awareness to women trafficking. It aims to collect enough signatures to pressure the Israeli justice ministry to back legislation that makes it a crime for men to go to prostitutes. This legislation is the next important step in the fight against women trafficking, said attorney Ori Keidar, one of the founders of the task force against the problem. ""The legislation against the prostitutes' customers will bring a reduction in the demand for prostitution and it will be a less lucrative business for crime organizations,"" Keidar said. ""This in turn will bring a reduction in the trafficking of women."" Keidar said the legislation is modeled after similar legislation in Sweden that has drastically reduced trafficking and prostitution. Over the past decade, about 10,000 women have been trafficked into Israel in what Keidar calls ""modern slavery."" The women are locked, beaten, raped, starved and forced to receive 15-30 men a day 365 days a year, according to the attorney. About three years ago, Israeli police greatly reduced women trafficking by pouring resources into the problem. Security forces have also helped by stepping up patrols on the Israeli-Egyptian border as a result of al Qaeda presence in the Sinai. This 300-kilometer border was the main route for smuggling women into Israel, Keidar said. ""This legislation against the customers will bring a further reduction in trafficking and with a little more pressure we can make this go away"" Keidar said.","The women have price tags detailing their age, weight and height .

The bridge was created by weaving a combination of roots into two Kubang trees placed on either side of the Bayang River that gradually grew strong enough over the course of 26 years for the residents of of Pulut-pulut and Lubuak Glare to use it as a crossing. Vital link: The root bridge is used to connect the two villages of Pulut-pulut and Lubuak Glare as the previous bamboo bridges were all destroyed by the river . A living tree bridge: Tourists cross the 'Jembatan Akar' root bridge in Bayang Village, Pesisir Selatan District, West Sumatra, Indonesia . Unique: The rickety tree bridge, which has been constricted a couple of feet over the fast-flowing Bayang River, is used to connect the residents of two tiny villages on either side . For more than 100 years, families have used the 30 metre bridge to reach one another, trade supplies and connect and it is now a mainstay tourist attraction of the province. The incredible engineering was captured by amateur photographer Robertus Pudyanto who visited the villages with help from the locals. Robertus said: 'The root bridge is frequently visited by tourists during the holidays or before Eid as they are considered sacred. 'They are extremely vital to the villagers and their entire lives depend on them. 'The creations are remarkable but you have to be careful when walking on them in the rain as they become slippery - and that's not good when hovering five metres over a fast-flowing river.' Ancient: The 30 metre bridge took 26 years to fully form over the Bayang River and has been used ever since for the last 100 years . Dangerous: Crossing the bridge can be dangerous when it is raining as the water makes it slippery . Woven together: The roots are woven across the river to Kubang trees growing on either side . Root bridges were first created by Muslim Ulama named Pakih Sohan and have been used in the region since 1890. The construction process takes approximately 26 years. They were created after original bamboo bridges were battered and broken by the Bayang River's torrential currents. The process of creating the bridge begins by stringing together tree roots along a stem bridge made of bamboo. They then strengthen and grow over time into a bridge strong enough to cross. Around the base of the bridge, there are thousands Larangan fish that are also considered sacred and are forbidden to be fished or taken. According to local belief, when residents bathe in the Bayang River around the root bridge their hopes and wishes to find love and better fortune will be granted by God. Sacred: Local legend suggests that swimming in the Bayang River around the root bridge will grant the bather their wishes for love and fortune . Mainstay: The root bridge in Bayang Village, Pesisir Selatan District, West Sumatra, Indonesia, is now a popular tourist attraction for people visiting the region . Natural construction: The bridges are made by weaving a combination of roots along a stem bridge made of bamboo that will grow stronger over time .","Living root bridge called 'Jembatan Akar' connects two villages in Pesisir Selatan District, West Sumatra, Indonesia .

"(CNN) -- Olympic hero Michael Phelps was suspended from competitive swimming for three months on Thursday -- just hours after one of his sponsors announced it would not renew his contract after a photo surfaced of him smoking from a bong. Michael Phelps admitted ""regrettable behavior"" after a  photo of him smoking from a bong was published. USA Swimming, the nation's governing body for competitive swimming, said it was withdrawing financial support for Phelps and barring him from competition during the period of his ""reprimand."" ""This is not a situation where any anti-doping rule was violated, but we decided to send a strong message to Michael because he disappointed so many people, particularly the hundreds of thousands of USA Swimming-member kids who look up to him as a role model and a hero,"" they said in a statement. ""Michael has voluntarily accepted this reprimand and has committed to earn back our trust,"" the statement continued. Earlier Thursday, Kellogg Co. said it will not renew Phelps' advertising contract. ""Michael's most recent behavior is not consistent with the image of Kellogg,"" company spokeswoman Susanne Norwitz said. ""His contract expires at the end of February, and we have made a decision not to extend his contract."" Norwitz said Kellogg's relationship with Phelps began with the company's support of the U.S. Olympic team. Kellogg did not renew its sponsorship of the team when it expired in December, she said. Phelps admitted ""regrettable behavior"" on Sunday after a British newspaper published the photograph. The tabloid News of the World showed Phelps using the bong during what it said was a November party at the University of South Carolina in Columbia. The Richland County, South Carolina, sheriff's office said Tuesday it was investigating whether Phelps smoked marijuana on the school campus, adding it would file criminal charges if it determined he did. Both university police and Columbia, South Carolina, police said they would not pursue charges, according to The State newspaper in Columbia. It was unclear where the party took place, the paper said, or whether it was on campus. On Thursday, before the decisions by USA Swimming and Kellogg were announced, Phelps told CNN affiliate WBAL that the incident was a result of ""bad judgment.""  Watch Phelps' comments to WBAL » . ""I can learn from it and try to make my life better than it has been in the past,"" he told WBAL. ""I think it's hard to really be ready for any of this. But I've actually been able to talk to a lot of people, and lot of people that have been in my shoes in other sports, and I've been able to get their perspective and just talk to them a little bit, and that's been helpful over the last few days,"" Phelps said. In a statement released Sunday, Phelps, who won a record eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China, said: ""I engaged in behavior which was regrettable and demonstrated bad judgment."" ""I'm 23 years old, and despite the successes I have had in the pool, I acted in a youthful and inappropriate way, not in a manner that people have come to expect from me,"" he said. ""For this, I am sorry. I promise my fans and the public -- it will not happen again."" iReport.com: Should Phelps have been suspended? The U.S. Olympic Committee also issued a statement that said in part: ""Michael has acknowledged that he made a mistake and apologized for his actions. We are confident that, going forward, Michael will consistently set the kind of example we all expect from a great Olympic champion."" In 2004, Phelps was arrested on charges of driving under the influence in Salisbury, Maryland. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months probation. He also issued an apology after that incident. Phelps is one of 12 Olympic athletes who pledged to ""My Victory,"" an initiative launched last year by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency aimed at keeping competitive sports clean.","USA Swimming suspends Michael Phelps from competition for three months .

"An exam board apologised yesterday for a 'confusing' chemistry A-level question that students complain was impossible to answer. The Assessment and Qualifications Alliance admitted that guidance given in an A2 paper sat by just under 16,000 teenagers was 'unhelpful'. It has insisted that examiners will take into account 'the potential for confusion' when marking the question and ensure that students are not penalised. Frustration: Students argue that a question was 'impossible to answer using the data provided' in a chemistry exam on Tuesday (file pic) Students have set up a Facebook page, Thechem5paperwasadisgrace, which is 'liked' by over 2,000 people, in protest over the AQA chemistry exam which was sat on Tuesday. They argue that one question was 'impossible to answer using the data provided' while some claim there wasn't enough time to complete the difficult paper. The contested question - worth five marks out of a potential 100 for the whole paper - asked students to make a calculation using a ratio they should have come up with in part one. To help students who could not calculate the original ratio, the paper gave them another ratio to use to answer part two. However, it also told them in bold print that this was 'not the correct ratio'. One student said: 'A question regarding the percentage of a certain compound required us to use a ratio from the previous question. However if one did not get that ratio, there was a 'wrong' ratio given for use to at least get method marks. 'However, the result using this ratio was more than 100 per cent which is chemically, mathematically and theoretically impossible.' Another said: 'I know that a lot of students spent a long time trying to work out a rational answer and so ran out of time to answer other questions. I feel sorry for a lot of people who are now worried that they won't get into university because of this exam.' Baffling: The contested question was worth five marks out of a potential 100 for the whole paper . A spokeswoman for AQA said: 'We expect that the majority of students will have answered part one of the question correctly, used the ratio that they have calculated and will therefore have had no problems. 'However, the alternative ratio given in A6(d) (ii) leads to an answer that is different to what students would normally expect to see. 'Although the question can still be answered, we recognise the alternative ratio given was unhelpful and it has clearly caused confusion for some students. 'We apologise to these students and accept it would have been better to use a different ratio.' She added: 'We would like to reassure students that we have established procedures in place to deal with issues like this. 'Our examiners will take into account the potential for confusion when they mark the papers and will ensure the results of those students who used the alternative ratio are not affected.'","Anger over chemistry on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- The wife of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid underwent neck surgery Friday after being injured with their daughter in a four-vehicle wreck in suburban Washington a day earlier, her surgeon said. Since the surgery, Landra Reid, 69, has been able ""to get out of bed, her pain is well-controlled and she's able to swallow some,"" said Dr. Elizabeth Franco of Inova Fairfax Hospital. She can move her arms and legs, but is expected to go through physical therapy before being released in a few days, Franco said. Reid's wife broke her neck, a vertebra in her lower back and her nose, the doctor said. The couple's adult daughter, Lana Reid Barringer of McLean, Virginia, suffered a neck injury and facial lacerations, the senator's spokesman, Jon Summers, said Thursday. Lana Reid was released from the hospital Thursday night. The wreck occurred in the northbound lanes of Interstate 95 in Fairfax County at 1:10 p.m., when the 2005 Honda Odyssey driven by the daughter began braking in stop-and-go traffic and was rear-ended by a tractor-trailer, according to a Virginia State Police report. ""The impact forced the Honda Odyssey to rear-end the vehicle in front of it, a 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee,"" it says. ""The Jeep Grand Cherokee was then forced into the next lane over where it struck a 2007 Chevrolet Cobalt."" The drivers of the Jeep and the Chevrolet also were taken to Inova Fairfax Hospital. Their injuries were not considered life-threatening. The driver of the truck, Allan W. Snader, 59, of Ohio, was charged with reckless driving, the police report said. He was not injured in the crash. The tractor-trailer was carrying rolls of plastic. The 70-year-old senator visited his wife and daughter shortly after hearing of the accident at 2:15 p.m., then returned to his office in the Capitol to work on health care legislation, said Reid spokesman Jim Manley. He was back at the hospital later in the afternoon and stayed until midnight, then returned early Friday to be there for his wife's surgery, Summers said. Summers told reporters Landra Reid's recovery is the senator's top priority, but ""his plans have not changed at all"" in Congress. ""Landra and I have been married for 50 years -- she is the love of my life,"" Reid said in a statement read by Summers at a news conference. ""And I look forward to her making a quick recovery as soon as possible."" Reid met his wife at Basic High School in Henderson, Nevada, during the mid-1950s. They married in 1959 and had their first child, Lana, two years later. Three boys followed. The couple has 16 grandchildren.

"(CNN) -- A World War II German bomber, likely the last of its kind, has been raised from the bottom of the English Channel and will be restored for display in a British museum. ""It has been lifted and is now safely on the barge and in one piece,"" Ajay Srivastava, a spokesman for RAF Museum, told the BBC. The Royal Air Force shot down the Dornier Do-17 twin-engine medium bomber of the German Luftwaffe on August 26, 1940, during the Battle of Britain. It was one of 1,500 built by Germany and the last known to be in existence, according to the RAF Museum. Germany employed more than 400 Dornier 17s during the Battle of Britain, and 200 of those were lost. Most wrecks were melted down and recycled into making planes and armaments for Britain, according to the museum. The plane raised Monday was damaged in a battle with RAF Defiant fighters as it tried to attack airfields in Essex, the museum said. Its pilot made a belly landing on Goodwin Sands in the channel off Kent, and the plane sank upside down in about 50 feet of water. The pilot and another crew member who survived the crash were taken prisoner and sent to prisoner-of-war camps in Canada, the museum said. Two other crew members died. The plane remained undisturbed on the floor of the English Channel until divers spotted it in 2008. ""The aircraft is in remarkable condition -- considering the events surrounding its loss plus the effects of spending so many years under water,"" the museum's website says. ""Other than marine concretion it is largely intact, the main undercarriage tires remain inflated and the propellers clearly show the damage inflicted during their final landing."" The museum then stepped in with a nearly million-dollar effort (about 600,000 pounds) to raise the craft and launch a restoration project. ""The discovery of the Dornier is of national and international importance. The aircraft is a unique and unprecedented survivor from the Battle of Britain. It is particularly significant because, as a bomber, it formed the heart of the Luftwaffe assault and the subsequent Blitz,"" Air Vice-Marshal Peter Dye, director general of the RAF Museum, says on the museum's website. ""The Dornier will provide an evocative and moving exhibit that will allow the museum to present the wider story of the Battle of Britain and highlight the sacrifices made by the young men of both air forces and from many nations,"" Dye says on the website. Once the plane is ashore, it will be soaked in a citric acid solution to stop corrosion, the first step in a restoration process expected to take two years. The plane then will go on display at the RAF Museum in north London.

"Former Manchester United star Paul Scholes says Manchester City fans are failing to offer their team the necessary support on big European nights. Scholes, who won the Champions League twice with United, said that atmospheres like Old Trafford and Anfield fire their teams up on European nights. But City's Etihad Stadium doesn't have the same impact, according to the ex-England midfielder. Paul Scholes was critical of Manchester City fans leaving the stadium almost empty at 7.15 on Tuesday . The former Manchester United star said he thought City fans didn't realise how much the competition means . ‘The crowd need to get behind this team they need to create a special European atmosphere,' Scholes told ITV ahead of City's home game with Roma, which was watched by 37,509 fans, nearly 10,000 down on capacity. ‘I was lucky enough to play at Old Trafford and we always talked about the atmosphere on a Tuesday night, the special atmosphere you create, and the crowd is rocking when you go out for a warm up. ‘At quarter past seven and there's empty seats everywhere.

You go to Liverpool, you go to Old Trafford, you go to Chelsea, they have a special feeling for it.' Scholes also suggested that the City fans don't appreciate how fortunate they are to be facing Europe's elite clubs. ‘Tonight I don't think there is [a special atmosphere]. I don't think they realise what a big game this is. ‘They've got the team, they've definitely got the players, the quality is definitely there, but do the crowd realise how lucky they are to be in this competition? I don't think they do.’ Another Manchester United legend Rio Ferdiand also hit out at City's fans. The former England captain tweeted:  'How many empty seats are there at the City vs Roma game by the way...big CL game & fans would rather Ramsays Kitchen or something at home'.

"Juventus may currently enjoy a five-point advantage at the top of Serie A but they're already keen to further bolster their strikeforce for another title assault. According to Sunday's edition of Tuttosport, Juve director general Giuseppe Marotta is weighing up a move for PSG's Edinson Cavani in the summer. The Uruguayan has scored 15 goals in 28 matches this season so far and would certainly be an impressive addition to Juve's front line if they can stump up the cash. Tuttosport want to sign PSG's Edinson Cavani this summer as they attempt to bolster their attack . On the field, Juve host Chievo on Sunday afternoon as they try to increase the gap between themselves and Roma at the top of the table.

Both Gazzetta Sportiva and Corriere dello Sport reflect on Saturday night's 3-1 win for Lazio win over Milan, a result that sees the Rome club maintain their grip on third place. 'The Rossoneri hit rock bottom' say Gazzetta, who picture the moment of madness that saw Philippe Mexes sent off for an injury time tussle with Stefano Mauri. They report that vice-president Adriano Galliani was not impressed after Milan surrendered a lead to lose at the Stadio Olimpico and the side will try to regain their togetherness with a training retreat ahead of their Coppa Italia quarter-final with Lazio on Tuesday. 'Turbo Lazio' reads the headline in Corriere, adding that Pippo Inzaghi is feeling the heat after a defeat that leaves them ninth in the table, some 20 points behind the leaders.

'Cristiano goes mad' they say, adding the star could miss the derby on February 7 after his senseless punch, slap and kick on Cordoba defender Edimar. In the end, Real were bailed out by Gareth Bale, who scored an 89th-minute penalty to keep them at the La Liga summit. AS describe it as the 'Miracle in the Arcangel' as Bale's intervention secured a late victory. 'It's hotting up' reads the headline on Marca after Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid all won .

Catalan paper Mundo Deportivo were understandably delighted with Barcelona's 'thrashing' of Elche and feature star men Messi and Neymar on their front page.

"Apple charges you £15 for a 'Lightning' charger cable for the new iPhone - or £30 for an adapter so that you can use your older accessories. Fans might be hoping they could bypass this additional cost with the help of third-party manufacturers creating cheaper versions of the cables. But it appears Apple has locked down its cables - adding an authentication chip which is likely to stop any other cables working with the £529 device. No entry: Apple appears to employ a chip within the Lightning cable, to stop unauthorised cables being used with the new iPhone . The Double Helix cable team took apart a Lightning cable in order to find the chip inside . Apple has come in for criticism before for shunning the rest of the industry's EU-directed move towards a standard micro-USB connection. And fans were left angry by the move to the Lightning connector which, while smaller and thinner, makes old accessories obsolete without the £30 adapter. The discovery of an authentication chip within the cable was revealed on AppleInsider, a website dedicated to the iPhone manufacturer. The site spoke to 'Peter', from the company Double Helix Cables, who pulled apart the cable which came with the new phone. From his investigation, the site warns iPhone owners not to purchase the cheap third-party Lightning chargers now appearing on eBay and other sites. Peter dismantled the Lightning connector and found what appear to be an authentication chip inside, located directly between the data cable and the power pin. Pricey cable: Apple sells its own propriety adapters on its website for £30 . Break from the past: Apple's senior vice president of marketing Phil Schiller announcing the new lightning port two weeks ago . The new Apple iPhone 5 has had record-breaking sales, selling five million devices in the first weekend . The inclusion of a chip tallies with the reported increase in cost to produce the cable, costing an estimated $3.50 to Apple. AppleInsider said this was a 775 per cent increase on the costs of producing the previous cable. While some of that increase will be down to the new design and economies of scale, the addition of a chip will have sent the production price upwards. Peter said:'There is basically no way those are functional cables. 'You can't just build a Lightning cable by making something with the same shape and connectivity, and my teardown proves that. 'The chip has to be there, and it is directly in the signal path of the V+ wire.' He added that users would not be able to make a cable, or adapt an existing one - 'at least not without a precise dissection of an Apple-branded Lightning cable.'","Authentication chip appears to stop unauthorised cables being used with iPhone .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 04:56 EST, 18 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:30 EST, 18 April 2012 . A meeting between Anders Breivik and an English anti-Islamic militant calling himself ‘Richard the Lionheart’ was outlined in court yesterday. Nine years before his killing spree left 77 dead, the Norwegian said he was sitting in a London cafe with members of an extremist group called Knights Templar, to plot ‘how to seize power in Western Europe’. As well as ‘Richard the Lionheart’, Breivik was also ‘ordained’ by the group and given the name of the 12th-century Norwegian king, Sigurd ‘the Crusader’. Defiant: Breivik, for a third day running, pumped his fist out in front of him as he took to the stand to answer questions . Under cross-examination on the third . day of his trial yesterday, the right-wing extremist initially refused . to discuss meetings in Liberia and London in April and May 2002 as he . joined a network of ‘like-minded’ militant anti-Muslim nationalists. But after repeated questioning by . prosecutor Inga Bejer Engh, who told him she was trying to shed doubt on . the network’s existence, he conceded he had travelled to Africa and . London ten years ago to help set up his Knights Templar (KT) movement. For the first time Breivik, 33, . appeared rattled as it emerged he left Oslo on April 17, 2002, to fly to . the Ivory Coast before entering Liberia, posing as an aid worker. Breivik said that once there he met an exiled Serbian ‘war hero’, but . refused to identify the man. Breivik became agitated and claimed . Norwegian police had not been clever enough to uncover the KT movement’s . members. He said: ‘Exactly what is it you’re getting at? Are you trying . to sow doubt over whether the KT network exists? It does.’ Fearless: Mass killer Anders Breivik, pictured with his lawyer Geir Lippestad, told the court if he had feared death he would never have undertaken his 'operation' Fantasist: Anders Breivik, seen with lawyer Geir Lippestad, was told by prosecutors that his Knights Templar organisation didn't exist as he imagined . Hard job, but somebody has to do it: The stress of defending mass killer Anders Breivik shows on his face as he talks to a member of his team in the Oslo court . The court heard that Breivik flew to . London in late April 2002 where he attended a founding session of the KT . movement but he refused to give exact details of his co-conspirators. As images of Breivik’s 1,800-page . manifesto were flashed on to screens, the court heard that he met three . other founding members of the Knights Templar during his London visit. At 23, he was the youngest member of the group. World watches: Journalists work at the pressroom as defendant Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik is led into court for the third day of his trial . There were two Englishmen – including . his ‘mentor’, Richard the Lionheart – and a French nationalist at the . founding meeting. Breivik told the court: ‘It is not in my interest here . to discuss what went on. What I will say is that Richard was responsible for calling the meeting.’ In his manifesto, Breivik said: ‘It was basically a long-term plan on how to seize power in Western Europe.’ He told the court that the people he . had met in London had ‘great integrity’ and how his codename of . ‘Crusader’ was taken from Sigurd Magnusson, a 12th-century Viking king. Asked if he felt he had met some . ‘like-minded friends’ in London, he said: ‘I felt I was a foot soldier . associated with the others. Now I feel I have managed to do what I . wanted to do.’ Breivik also said he should face the death penalty – describing the 21 years he faces in prison as ‘pathetic’. When asked if he thought Norway should introduce the death penalty, he replied: ‘It would be the right thing.’ Watching intently: Hajrie, left, and Donika Selaci cousins of Lejla Selaci, who was gunned down by Norwegian Anders Behring Breivik, study his trial today from Vucitrn, Kosovo .

"(CNN) -- NBC's medical correspondent Dr. Nancy Snyderman has issued an apology after she reportedly violated the quarantine her team was placed in when their cameraman contracted Ebola. During the NBC Nightly News broadcast on Monday, anchor Brian Williams read out the following statement from Snyderman: . ""While under voluntary quarantine guidelines, which called for our team to avoid public contact for 21 days, members of our group violated those guidelines and understand that our quarantine is now mandatory until 21 days have passed. We remain healthy and our temperatures are normal. ""As a health professional I know that we have no symptoms and pose no risk to the public, but I am deeply sorry for the concerns this episode caused. We are thrilled that Ashoka (Mukpo) is getting better and our thoughts continue to be with the thousands affected by Ebola whose stories we all went to cover."" Trip to Liberia . Snyderman and her team went into a 21-day voluntary isolation after Mukpo, their freelance cameraman, was found to have contracted Ebola. The team had been in Liberia, a hotspot for the outbreak. Mukpo is recovering at the Nebraska Medical Center where he is receiving an experimental drug called brincidofovir, or CMX001. Twenty one days is standard length for quarantine because that's how long the disease's incubation period is. But the NBC crew apparently broke its word. Takeout order . The website Planet Princeton reported that Snyderman went to a restaurant to pick up a takeout order. Shortly after, the New Jersey Department of Health mandated the crew remain quarantined. ""Unfortunately, the NBC crew violated this agreement and so the Department of Health Friday evening issued a mandatory quarantine order to ensure that the crew will remain confined until October 22,"" the health department said. ""The NBC crew remains symptom-free, so there is no reason for concern of exposure to the community,"" it read. Expressing appreciation . Meanwhile, Mukpo posted a status update on his Facebook page Monday, thanking everyone for their concerns. ""There have been some dark and profoundly frightening moments in this ordeal, but I want everyone to know that your good energy, love, and support was felt in a very direct way over these last two weeks,"" he wrote. I won't ever know exactly when I slipped up and contracted the virus. I had been taking precautions but obviously they weren't enough.""","""We remain healthy and our temperatures are normal,"" she says .

"It’s already possible to use your smartphone in place of a wallet, and now it seems Apple wants your iPhone to replace your car keys. A patent granted this week hints that Apple is working on technology that would allow a driver to use their iPhone or possibly an Apple Watch to access their car. It would use a Bluetooth connection and an access code to unlock a vehicle. A patent granted this week hints that Apple is working on technology that would allow a driver to use their iPhone or possibly Apple Watch to access their car (shown in this illustration) The US patent relates to ‘a primary portable device [that] can access a vehicle by transmitting an activation message including a vehicle access credential to the vehicle.’ This means that drivers could use their iPhone to unlock their car, as well as starting the engine. The patent suggests that one device – an iPhone for example – could pass a digital key onto another gadget – perhaps another iPhone or the Apple Watch, and this could be used to unlock a car. Other firms are also working on devices and apps with which to unlock cars. For example, BMW lets drivers of certain cars lock and unlock them using their smartphone and a software firm called Eleks Lab has created an experimental app that could let Tesla drivers control their car's functions from the Apple Watch (shown) Apple Pay launched last year in the US and lets people with an iPhone 6 and 6 Plus pay for goods by tapping their handsets on NFC readers, in lieu of a wallet. It works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. This confirms the person's identity, and the payment is made as if the user had presented and signed their card. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. Apple Pay is currently available in more than 220,000 shops, and 17 banks, in the US. Visa has already said it is working with Apple to bring the service to the UK this year. Apple already owns a similar patent that could allow drivers to unlock their vehicle using their iPhone with an ‘accessory control,’ Business Insider reported. While many ideas in patents never make it into final products, the race is on to give drivers access to their cars with mobile handsets. For example, BMW lets drivers of certain cars lock and unlock them using their smartphone. Hyundai has also launched an Android Wear watch that connects to its Blue Link system to start a car’s engine or lock and unlock its doors. The gadget uses voice recognition to find lost cars in car parks too. Software engineering company Eleks Lab has created an app to run on the Apple Watch that would allow drivers of Tesla’s Model S to lock their car, turn on its headlights and show where it is parked. The firm, which has offices in London and in the Ukraine, made the app as an experiment and said it would work using web-service API.","Apple's US patent hints two devices would be needed to unlock a car .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Saudi Arabian man injured in the Boston Marathon bombings has filed a defamation lawsuit against Glenn Beck after the conservative radio host accused him of being 'the money man' behind the fatal attack. The former Fox News host concocted a conspiracy theory following the April 2013 attack that connected Alhabri to al Qaeda and from there linked the idea to the Obama administration. Adding to the absurdity of Beck's claims that Abdulrahman Alharbi, 20, was a conspirator in the Boston bombings is the fact that Alharbi was a spectator at the race who was one of hundreds of people injured in the terrorist attack. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Conspiracy theory: Glenn Beck claimed that a Muslim victim of the Boston Marathon bombing was somehow behind the attack . Not involved: Abdulrahman Alharbi was investigated after the bombing and authorities quickly concluded he had nothing to do with the attack . Beck hinged his theory that Alharbi was . somehow responsible for the attack on the fact that he 'was set to be . deported under section 212 3B' for 'terrorist activities.' The radio host spent the next several days lobbing unfounded accusations against the young Saudi Arabian man, challenging anyone who didn't believe him to prove him wrong. Beck even suggested that President Obama was somehow involved in the attack after photos emerged of what appeared to be Michelle Obama visiting Alharbi in the hospital following the attack - as she did with dozens of the bombing victims. Beck's campaign to pin the attack on Alharbi was stalled when a former immigration official explained to him how a person would get the designation of 212 3B, and how his theory about Alharbi 'doesn't make sense.' After the appearance by former INS Special Agent Bob Trent seemed to discredit the majority of Beck's theory, the radio host went from talking about it every day to rarely mentioning it, apparently hoping his listeners would forget that it ever happened. One person who definitely didn't forget is Alharbi, who has named Beck and his companies, The Blaze Inc. and Mercury Radio Arts - as well as his radio syndicator, Premier Radio Networks - in the defamation lawsuit it filed in federal court. Tragic: Three people were killed during the bombing, as well as a police officer fatally shot by one of the suspected bombers . According to the suit, first obtained by Courthouse News, Beck 'repeatedly and falsely' identified Alharbi as having been an active participant in the attack. On April 21, less than a week after the attack, Beck went on his radio program and said, 'Let me just say this to those at the highest echelons of government, we know who this . Saudi national is, and it is in your best interest and the best interest . of integrity and trust for the people of United States of America – . it’s best coming from you, not coming from a news organization. It’s . best coming from you. You have until (April 22). We have information on . who this man is, (and) we know he is a very bad, bad, bad man.' Beck later identified this 'very bad, bad, bad man ' as Alharbi. After the April 15 bombing, authorities questioned Alharbi, who allowed officer to search his apartment. Authorities quickly determined that Alharbi had nothing to do with the bombing - other than having been injured in the attack. Alharbi was one of about 265 people injured during the April 15, 2013, blast th . But Beck's onslaught claiming he was a terrorist waged on - which led to harassment from those who those who believed Alharbi was responsible for the bombing.' According to the suit, since Beck made his claims that Alharbi was behind the terrorist attack, people have left the young Saudi messages calling him a 'murderer, child killer, and terrorist.' The harassment, Alharbi's attorneys say, was the direct result of Beck's unfounded claims that he was involved in the bombings. 'Those statements were made widely and publicly,' the suit claims. 'The . statements were false and did grave injury to the plaintiff.' Alharbi is seeking punitive damages for defamation with malice.","For several days after the Boston bombing, Conservative radio host Glenn Beck claimed he had proof that a 20-year-old Saudi national was the 'money man' for the attack .

"Dr. Ben Carson's path to the White House begins by walking away from Fox News. On Friday, amid media reports about Carson's preparations to possibly run for president, Carson and Fox confirmed that his relationship with the cable news channel had been severed. From now on, when Carson appears on Fox, it'll be as a newsmaking guest, not as a paid contributor. Carson, formerly a neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital, signed up with Fox back in October 2013. Earlier that year, he had garnered attention for speeches at the National Prayer Breakfast, the Conservative Political Action Conference and elsewhere. While contributing to Fox programs, he openly flirted with the possibility of a presidential run in 2016. In September, he told the radio host Hugh Hewitt that the chances of a run were ""reasonably good,"" but that he was waiting for a ""few more months."" It's been a couple of months, at least. Earlier this week, The Washington Times (which publishes columns by Carson) reported that a flattering documentary about him, titled ""A Breath of Fresh Air: A New Prescription for America,"" is set to air this weekend in local markets across the country. ""A production company run by conservative personality Armstrong Williams filmed the documentary and is paying for the airtime,"" The Times reported. ""Mr. Williams is also Mr. Carson's business manager."" Soon after the hourlong ad telecasts were reported, Fox said Carson was no longer a contributor. Fox took similar action with two contributors, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, in the run-up to the 2012 election. Carson said in a statement Friday evening that ""at this time, no decision has been made to run for president."" ""However, recognizing the possibility, Fox News felt I needed complete independence to fully examine my options,"" he said. ""My departure has been thoroughly amicable and is in the best interest for both Fox News and myself."" Fox's own website quoted a GOP strategist, Tyler Harber, as saying, ""The man's running.

"A British father has made medical history by having his healthy prostate removed after discovering that he carries a defective gene that boosts his risk of cancer, it was reported last night. The businessman’s increased risk of cancer through the BRCA2 gene is believed to  have come to light when he  took part in a trial at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) in London. He entered the trial because he has relatives who have suffered from breast or prostate cancer in the past. Scientists believe that others who know they are carriers will choose to go down the same route (stock image) The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are known to be linked to an aggressive form of breast cancer. Last week Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie revealed she had had surgery to remove both her breasts to reduce the risk of getting breast cancer after testing positive for the rogue BRCA1 gene. In the latest case, the Briton, 53, who is married with children, asked to have his prostate removed so that he could avoid the fate of his relatives. It is understood that doctors were initially reluctant to perform the operation as removal of the prostate leaves men infertile and can also result in incontinence. It is believed there were no signs to suggest the man’s prostate was unhealthy. Angelina Jolie chose to have a double mastectomy as her chance of developing breast cancer was very high . Roger Kirby, the surgeon who performed the procedure, told The Sunday Times: 'the relatively low level of cancerous cells we found in this man's prostate before the operation would these days not normally prompt immendiate surgery to remove the gland, but given what we do know about the nature of BRCA2, it was definitely the right thing to do for this patient.' Following the surgery, a number of previously undetected BRCA cells were discovered. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with over 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year. Prostate cancer usually develops slowly, so there may be no signs you have prostate cancer for many years. Symptoms often only become apparent when your prostate is large enough to affect the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the penis). When this happens, you may notice things like an increased need to urinate, straining while urinating and a feeling your bladder has not fully emptied. However, these signs do not mean you have prostate cancer. It is more likely they are caused by something else, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (also known as BPH or prostate enlargement). NHS Choices . Experts say that knowing you are a carrier of the cells is difficult, and that they believe other men may now follow suit. Prostate cancer affects one in eight men in the UK and there are 10,000 deaths each year. Angelina Jolie announced earlier this week that she had a double mastectomy as she was a carrier of the BRCA1 gene. The 37-year-old actress's decision was made all the more poignant by the fact that Angelina lost her mother Marcheline Bertrand to ovarian cancer when she was just 56. She paid tribute to her husband Brad Pitt and family who supported her decision. In an editorial piece in the New York Times entitled 'My Medical Choice', Angelina wrote: 'I am fortunate to have a partner, Brad Pitt, who is so loving and supportive. 'So to anyone who has a wife or girlfriend going through this, know that you are a very important part of the transition. Brad was at the Pink Lotus Breast Center, where I was treated, for every minute of the surgeries. Following the operations, Angelina's risk of contracting breast cancer has now dropped to under five per cent. She wrote: 'My doctors estimated that I had an 87 per cent risk of breast cancer and a 50 per cent risk of ovarian cancer, although the risk is different in the case of each woman.

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN)  -- A Nigerian militant group claimed Wednesday it sabotaged oil pipelines in the country's oil-rich southern Niger Delta, but the country's military denies the assertion. File image of armed MEND militants in Niger Delta region of Nigeria . The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) said in an e-mail message to reporters that the ""major Shell and Agip crude trunk lines in Bayelsa state"" were struck. ""The Agip pipeline which connects the Agip Brass terminal was sabotaged at Nembe creek while the Shell Nembe creek line was done at Asawo village,"" MEND said. Shell said it is investigating reports of an attack on the Nembe creek pipeline and Agip could not be reached for comment. Rabe Abubakar, spokesman for the Nigerian military's Joint Task Force, said ""the militants are telling lies"" and ""there is no iota of truth in what they are saying."" Their claims against the Shell pipeline ""are not true,"" Abubakar said, explaining that explosives were hurled at the pipeline but the explosion was limited and it did not destroy the line. ""There was an attempt by them to blow up an Agip pipeline around 3 a.m., but the soldiers protected the place and the militants fled,"" Abubakar said. Explosives were found on a well and an explosives expert was brought in to remove them, he added. MEND -- which has declared an ""all-out war"" on the government -- demands that more of Nigeria's oil wealth be reinvested in the region, instead of enriching those whom the militants consider corrupt politicians. But fighting has continued despite Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua's recent call for an amnesty for the militant groups, an offer that stays open until October 4. Under the amnesty proposal, militants must hand in their weapons and take part in government rehabilitation programs. Also on Wednesday, the military said three people were seized for trying to blow up a pipeline at the Forcados River. But MEND said the military ""arrested two repentant armed youths who approached them to take advantage of the government's amnesty offer."" ""We are learning that there are about 11 of such cases currently languishing in detention inside the JTF headquarters in Warri,"" MEND said. Last month, Amnesty International said that pollution and other environmental impacts from the oil industry in the Niger Delta are creating a ""human rights tragedy"" in which local people suffer poor health and loss of livelihood. Governments and oil companies are failing to be accountable for the problems, Amnesty said in its report, called ""Petroleum, Pollution and Poverty in the Niger Delta."" Covering 46,500 square miles (75,000 square km), the Niger Delta is about the same size as the Czech Republic, according to the United Nations Development Programme. An area of rich biological diversity, the region contains the world's third-largest wetland with the most extensive freshwater swamp forest, according to the UNDP. More than half the area contains creeks and small islands, while the rest is rain forest, the UNDP says. At the same time, the Niger Delta produces the oil wealth that accounts for the bulk of Nigeria's foreign earnings, the UNDP says. Earlier this week, MEND said its fighters had blown up an oil pipeline and captured six crew members of a chemical tanker. MEND is now saying it has released the ship and the military says it secured the vessel. It is not clear whether the three Russians, two Filipinos and the Indian seized remain in custody. MEND told CNN that ""to their knowledge,"" the crew is no longer being held hostage.

"(CNN) -- Jerusalem, and Ramallah, West Bank: two crucial stops for U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in his ongoing attempt to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Kerry will travel to those cities on New Year's Day to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, respectively, ""to discuss ongoing final status negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians, among other issues,"" the State Department said in a statement Saturday. This will be the ninth trip to the region for Kerry, who has said that leaders remain ""as determined as ever"" to negotiate a peace deal. He kicked off talks in July, but in November, both sides dug into their decades-old trenches and passed around blame. Israelis and Palestinians are four months into a nine-month deadline given to them by Kerry to reach a peace deal, with little visible progress. But just hours after Kerry's plans were made public, Israel announced that 26 Palestinian prisoners will be freed over the next two days. The release is part of the deal that set in place the current peace talks, Netanyahu's office said in a statement. All of the released prisoners perpetrated offenses prior to the Oslo accords and have served sentences of 19-28 years, the Israeli statement said. With direct negotiations between the two sides flailing, the United States seems to have moved into a more muscular role as mediator by presenting its own bridging proposals to the parties instead of relying on the Israelis and Palestinians to negotiate among themselves. On Kerry's last visit to the Middle East, earlier this month, talk of Iran's nuclear program took center stage. That visit was the first following the deal Iran reached with the United States and five other world powers over its nuclear program. The agreement calls for the easing of economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for increased inspections and limits on the country's uranium enrichment program, which many international analysts fear is meant for military purposes. Netanyahu has strongly criticized the agreement. As for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Netanyahu has said that security is a must. Israel has insisted its own troops must remain in the Jordan Valley, as opposed to the international troops that patrol the tense borders with Syria and Lebanon. Palestinians have rejected, out of hand, having Israeli soldiers within the borders of their own states. Palestinians have further argued that Israel has been sowing distrust by continuing the construction of thousands of Jewish settlement units on the West Bank and other land that Palestinians claim as theirs.

"Most women treated for breast cancer during pregnancy or women who become pregnant after undergoing treatment for the disease go on to have healthy babies, experts have said. Breast cancer is rare in younger women, although The Royal College of Obstetricians  and Gynaecologists (RCOG) say that the number who go on to have babies after being treated for the disease is increasing. Around 50,000 women are affected by breast cancer every year, but the RCOG said that treatment success rates in the UK are good and are continually improving, with five-year survival rates currently around 80 percent for the under-50s age group. Positive: Experts at the The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists say that most women treated for breast cancer during pregnancy or women who become pregnant after undergoing treatment for the disease go on to have healthy babies (picture posed by models) On rare occasions, breast cancer is diagnosed during pregnancy and the RCOG has published new patient information published outlining details for women who are pregnant and have been diagnosed with breast cancer, or who have recovered and are planning a family. Philippa Marsden, chair of the RCOG Patient Information Committee, said: 'It is important to emphasise that breast cancer during pregnancy is rare, with 1.3 to 2.4 cases per 10,000 live births. 'Being diagnosed with breast cancer whilst pregnant can be extremely frightening. However, a specialist team including a consultant obstetrician, midwife and breast team will look after a woman throughout her pregnancy and ensure the best possible outcome for both mother and baby.' For women diagnosed with breast cancer while pregnant, treatment will usually begin straight away and will be offered according to the type and extent of the cancer with a multidisciplinary team on hand to discuss all available treatment options. Improving: Around 50,000 women are affected by breast cancer every year, but the RCOG said that treatment success rates in the UK are good and are continually improving (picture posed by models) These include surgery to remove the lump or the affected breast. Surgery can be carried out at any stage in pregnancy, the RCOG said. Chemotherapy is not given during the first 13 weeks of pregnancy as it may cause abnormalities in the baby but after that, it is safe and chemotherapy may be offered to women fighting the disease. The anti-sickness and steroid treatments that control chemotherapy side effects are also safe and will not cause harm to the baby, but radiotherapy is not usually offered as a treatment option until after the birth. Two commonly used drugs - tamoxifen and herceptin - are often given after the initial treatment to reduce the chance of the cancer recurring. These drugs are not recommended during pregnancy and will be delayed until after the birth. Cath Broderick, chair of the RCOG Women’s Network, said: 'The diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer is improving all the time and we are now seeing more women than ever surviving the disease. 'Being pregnant does not seem to affect how successful treatment is. This patient information gives a lot of reassurance and advice for women in this situation.'","Disease affects 50,000 in the UK every year but is rare in younger women .

"Despite having his international future publicly questioned by Holland coach Louis van Gaal, Wesley Sneijder collected his 100th cap against Spain. Just two months ago Van Gaal said the Galatasaray midfielder was not doing enough to even warrant a place in the Dutch squad – but on Friday night Sneijder was back in the heart of the Oranje’s midfield on a landmark occasion. Century: Wesley Sneijder made his 100th appearance for Holland against Spain in the World Cup . Influential: Dutch playmaker Wesley Sneijder is back in favour with coach Louis van Gaal . The diminutive playmaker has had more ups and downs in his international career than most hundred-cap heroes, with a quarter final-winning brace against Brazil and receiving the Silver Ball for being voted the second best player at the 2010 finals contrasting with being stripped of the Dutch captaincy and a late World Cup final defeat after a lacklustre performance. Speaking . earlier this week, Sneijder said he had no intentions of ending his . rollercoaster career which has also taken in spells at Ajax, Real . Madrid, Inter Milan and most recently Galatasaray at club level. ‘When I was 21 or 22 I used to think footballers of 30 were old. They were close to finishing their careers,’ he said. ‘That . happens but there is no way I'm stopping just yet. You think this is my . last tournament? Are you crazy? You won't get rid of me over the next . four years.’ Leader: Despite being dropped as captain in favour of Robin van Persie, Sneijder is a key figure in the squad . Got it, boss: Van Gaal has given Sneijder another chance, despite criticising his form and fitness . ‘Everything that was said about me in the past is forgotten. Also the question of the captaincy. I'm looking only forward.’ The Dutch physios even spoke of their disbelief at Sneijder’s fitness when the national side got together at the end of May – amazing when less than 12 months ago Van Gaal said he was ‘not getting the message’ and questioned his fitness levels. Sneijder became the eight-youngest player to play for the Netherlands when he made his senior debut against Portugal in 2003, just a month after making his Under-21s international bow. Euro 2004 . came slightly too soon for him, contributing just 57 minutes of play off . the bench as the Dutch made it to the semi-finals. But by 2006 Sneijder was ready to take centre stage for his country, although perhaps the Dutch squad weren’t quite as ready. Experience: Wesley Sneijder has played at three World Cups and three European Championships . He . started all four games but was flying home early with his team-mates . after they were eliminated by Portugal in the infamous ‘Battle of . Nuremberg’ that saw 16 yellow cards dished out. Both 2008’s European Championships and the 2010 World Cup saw the number 10 at his best, being named in the team of the tournament for both competitions. Sneijder also picked up the Silver Ball in South Africa as the second-best player behind Diego Forlan, scoring five goals to eclipse his two in Austria and Switzerland. Poland and Ukraine in 2012 wasn’t quite as successful but after a spell out of the side Sneijder will be keen to show Van Gaal and his doubters what they could have missed out on – as well as getting revenge for the final defeat four years ago.","Dutch ace made 100th appearance since debut against Portugal in 2003 .

"(CNN) -- About 11.6 million Africans have been forced from their homes by wars and other conflicts, according to the United Nations. Next week in Uganda, leaders from across the continent will converge to tackle the issue. Somali women at a camp for displaced persons. Nearly half of the displaced people in the world are found in Africa, according to the United Nations. ""Africa is the continent most affected by the scourge and tragedy of forced displacement,"" the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said in a statement. ""While refugee populations have declined in recent years, internal displacement continues to rise and the number of people uprooted from their homes is mounting."" During the weeklong African Union summit that will start Monday in the capital, Kampala, the leaders are expected to sign a pledge to help the displaced across the continent, according to the U.N. agency for refugee issues. The agreement ""would be the first legally binding international instrument on internal displacement having such broad regional scope,"" the agency said. Aid agencies have blasted some African countries for failing refugees and internally displaced people. Last month, Oxfam International released an explosive report accusing Kenya and Ethiopia of housing Somali refugees in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. It said the Somali government also is abandoning its internally displaced. ""Somalis flee one of the world's most brutal conflicts and a desperate drought, only to end up in unimaginable conditions in camps that are barely fit for humans,"" said Robbert Van den Berg, a spokesman for Oxfam International in the Horn of Africa. ""Hundreds of thousands of children are affected, and the world is abandoning the next generation of Somalis when they most need our help."" On a visit to a refugee camp in northern Kenya that houses Somalis, actress and U.N. goodwill ambassador Angelina Jolie called it ""one of the most dire"" she had ever seen. The camp -- which has facilities for about 90,000 -- houses 280,000 refugees. ""The toilets are already overflowing,"" Jolie said last month. ""There is not even enough space for trash dumps, so people are living amongst the garbage."" Kenyan officials have said they are working on a solution. In neighboring Uganda, a government spokesman said it had taken steps to ensure displaced people and refugees have access to resources to become self-sufficient. ""The numbers of displaced have drastically gone down,"" Fred Opolot said. ""The government offers them relocation packages, including planting seeds, cooking items and building materials."" The east African nation has followed international protocol, Opolot said, noting that it was chosen to host the African Union summit on refugees. ""Uganda does not just set up camps; it builds facilities for them,"" Opolot said. ""There may well be some African countries that have not followed protocols. ... The summit will reassess the challenges they have and set up steps to ensure they follow international protocol.""","African leaders converge to tackle problem of conflict-displaced people .

"Bookies slash odds of a number one to 5/6 with X Factor finalist second in line with odds of 11/10 . By . Nadia Mendoza . Last updated at 5:06 PM on 5th December 2011 . All eyes will be on Little Mix, Marcus Collins and Amelia Lily next Saturday night to see which finalist will win X Factor and go on to have the Christmas No1. However, if choirmaster Gareth Malone has it his way, a different song may be topping the charts. The Bafta-winning star is hoping his group Military Wives will triumph over the festive period, with the 100 vocalists currently smashing pre-order records. Coming together: Military Wives look set to rival The X Factor Christmas No1 . Wherever You Are - a tribute to soldiers with lyrics taken from . love letters written by the women to their partners in Afghanistan - has stormed Amazon’s bestseller chart, two weeks before its release. The overwhelming response has led bookmakers to . slash the odds on it beating the X Factor winner. Paddy Power have slashed the odds to just 5/6 and the unknown X Factor singer is the second favourite in the betting at 11/10. Chris Evans is supporting the single, saying: 'With a fair wind it’ll be a Christmas . No1, one that actually means something.' The radio presenter is even urging Simon Cowell to do his bit for charity and let the wives perform on the X Factor final this weekend and the odds of them doing so are currently 3/1.

"By . Rachel Reilly . A Canadian academic is encouraging his students to pick their noses in a bid to see if the habit has any health benefits. Professor Scott Napper is requesting his pupils to investigate the possible health benefits of eating their mucous in a bid to understand the human immune system better. He believes that eating mucous in the nose may boost the immune system by introducing small and harmless amounts of germs back into the body. His theory follows others that suggest improved hygiene has led to an increase in allergies and auto-immune disorders. Getting stuck in: Parents discourage their children from picking their nose but it could be good for their health, claims one expert . His proposed study involves splitting his class into two. Half will eat their pickings whilst other will not engage in the antisocial behaviour. They will then observe how the immune system responds to the new habit. Professor Napper said: ‘All you would need is a group of volunteers. You would put some sort of molecule in all their noses, and for half of the group they would go about their normal business and for the other half of the group, they would pick their nose and eat it.' ‘Then you could look for immune responses against that molecule and if they're higher in the booger-eaters, then that would validate the idea.’ Professor Napper added that the greatest value of the snot-eating question is that, when he brings it up with his first-year science students they are instantly engaged in the class. ‘Get the student to think, rather than just sitting there taking down notes,’ Napper said. ‘[Science] should be about the exchange of ideas.’ But the associate professor of biochemistry at the University of Saskatchewan is a firm believer in the powers of picking your nose. He said: ‘Nature pushes us to do different things because it is to our advantage to have certain behaviours, to consume different types of foods. Other bad habits such as nail biting may also help boost the immune system . 'So maybe when you have an urge like this to pick your nose and eat it, you should just go with nature.’ 'From an evolutionary perspective, we evolved under very dirty conditions and maybe this desire to keep our environment and our behaviours sterile isn't actually working to our advantage,' he told CBC News. Experts such as Dr Hilary Longhurst, consultant immunologist from the Bart’s NHS Trust, believe a similar thing occurs when we bite our nails. ‘Unless your hands are filthy, the bugs we encounter when biting our nails could boost our immune system,' she said. The immune system works by developing a 'memory' and making a note of how to fight each bug it has ever encountered. When a bug is encountered a second time, the immune system reaches into its 'memory' and releases weapons — called memory lymphocytes — that know how to kill it.","Canadian academic Scott Napper wants his students to investigate the health benefits of the taboo habit .

"(CNN) -- The man destined to become leader of the world's most populous nation will sit in the halls of power in Beijing, but a part of him remains in the American heartland. Xi Jinping's visit to the United States last February included expected stops in Washington and trade meetings in California. Even an NBA game. But the part Xi, 59, looked most forward to was an evening in Muscatine, Iowa. He wanted to visit ""old friends"" he'd met on a trip to Iowa almost 30 years ago. Rewind to a time when Mikhail Gorbachev was ascending to the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, Terry Anderson was taken hostage in Lebanon and Tiananmen Square was just another place in Beijing. Xi arrived in Muscatine for two weeks in April 1985 with a Chinese delegation looking into farming technology. The next leader of the powerful communist state -- he is expected to take the helm early next year -- got a first-hand look at how American capitalists do agriculture. Doyle Tubandt, president of Muscatine Foods Corp., recalled how Xi discussed globalization, its scope then unimaginable to many Americans. As major Chinese leadership change begins, questions swirl . Tubandt marveled at today's global economy. His own company now exports food and pet products to China. Back then, he escorted Xi on a tour of a corn processing plant. At times, the language barrier was hard to overcome. How do you translate words such as centrifuge? Tubandt gestured heavily and drew drawings in the sand to explain things to his Chinese visitor. He kept a tin of black tea that Xi presented to him as a memento of the visit. After all these years, the tin is preserved half full. Tubandt was one of 14 people invited to a private dinner with Xi at the circa 1866 Victorian home of Sara Lande in February. They had all met Xi on his first trip. Then, Xi had dined on Iowa beef and corn. Lande decided to go up a notch on elegance for China's next leader. Her menu boasted tenderloin, spring rolls and bacon-wrapped scallops. ""You were the first group of Americans I came into contact with,"" Xi told his Iowa friends. ""To me, you are America."" Xi's visit was a big deal for Muscatine, a small eastern Iowa town known for farming, the largest Heinz plant outside of Pittsburgh and factories that used to spit out billions of mother-of-pearl buttons. That was before the refinement of plastic. As Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad put it: This is the biggest thing to hit Muscatine since Pope John Paul II's visit in 1979. Branstad, who also met Xi in 1985, was invited to the dinner hosted by Lande. ""We consider you a great friend of Iowa,"" Branstad told Xi, according to The Muscatine Journal. ""We are so appreciative you chose to come to Muscatine and to Iowa."" Xi also visited a farm near Maxwell, Iowa, in February, and while in the state, he and other Chinese officials signed a five-year cooperation deal with Washington on food security, food safety and sustainable agriculture. Three challenges for China's next leaders . Chris Steinbach, the Journal's former editor, told CNN that he had received thousands of e-mails from journalists around the world who were curious about Xi's visit. ""It's obviously a pretty big deal,"" Steinbach said. ""You never know what will come as a result of this kitchen-table diplomacy."" That kind of one-on-one relationship made an impression on Xi on his first trip to Iowa. ""When you get the opportunity to meet somebody in their home or in a private setting, you get to know them differently than at a state dinner,"" Steinbach said. ""Clearly that worked on Mr. Xi when he was here 27 years ago."" Now, as China's ruling Communist Party convenes its 18th National Congress, the world wonders what course the global power will chart under new leadership. What will the future bring for America's relationship with the Asian giant? In Iowa, some people know this: that sometimes, it pays to sit on a couch, in front of a blazing fire and build a bridge to friendship. And that even after Xi assumes China's top post, he will keep Muscatine close to his heart.","Xi Jinping visited Iowa in 1985 and returned earlier this year to Muscatine to visit ""old friends""

"(CNN) -- When she saw a Dayton, Ohio, police officer tangled up with a man, Angela Pierce could have kept on driving. Instead, she got out of the car to team up with the officer and join the fight. While the danger was real -- especially with the suspect in arm's reach of the officer's gun -- Pierce told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell that her thought process Saturday night was simple: The police officer needed help, and she was in a position to give it. ""I didn't even think about what (the suspect) could have had, I didn't think about what he could have done to me,"" Pierce said Thursday. ""I just went and tried to help."" A camera mounted to the officer's car showed the police officer -- identified by CNN affiliate WHIO as Officer Jonathan Seiter -- pulling over 64-year-old Otto Coleman on what appeared to be a routine traffic stop. But then Coleman attacked the officer, leading to a full-on scuffle. ""It was hands on, and it was a boxing match,"" Seiter told WHIO. Around that time, Pierce said she was driving by with her aunt, heading to a birthday party. She asked her aunt to pull over, then got out of the car and ran toward the scene to help. For less than a minute, Pierce pounded Coleman repeatedly on his head to help subdue him until more help arrived. ""That could have been my father or grandfather,"" Pierce said of her decision to help Seiter. ""I just kept on swinging, because I didn't want (Coleman) to get me or anything."" Pierce said that police initially handcuffed her, before soon realizing her part in the battle and releasing her. Subsequently, with Coleman by then under arrest, she and the other police officers exchanged high fives before she headed off to her party. Dayton police Sgt. Larry Tolpin warned that people could get seriously hurt when they jump into the fray -- even if it's on law enforcement's side. Still, he told CNN affiliate WDTN that Pierce deserved thanks for her effort. ""Don't get me wrong, I'm not endorsing that citizens participate in this manner,"" Tolpin said. ""But under this particular circumstance, it was very commendable of her.""","Angela Pierce was driving by when she saw a Dayton police officer and suspect scuffling .

They are still killing our people. Instead of wasting time, we should hit them back, and we should do it as early as possible to save the precious lives of our innocent girls like Malala Yousufzai,' he told reporters in Peshawar.

"(CNN) -- Philippines President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo declared martial law beginning Friday night in the southern province of Maguindanao, where 57 people were killed last week, an army spokesman told CNN Saturday. Army spokesman Lt. Col. Romeo Brawner Jr. said martial law -- under which police can make arrests without a warrant -- went into effect at 9 p.m. Congress would have to approve any extension beyond 60 days. Brawner said the measure was invoked to impose peace on the region after the unrest, which led to troops being mobilized. ""Life is to resume normally and martial law is established to prevent new violence, with troops on the ground monitoring any possible violence breakout,"" he said. ""But the civilian government will be running the affairs of the province, not a military governor."" Military police have detained three brothers and their father on suspicion of involvement in the unrest: Akmad Ampatuan, the vice governor of Maguindanao; Anwar Ampatuan, the mayor of Sherif Auguak, Maguindanao's capital; and Zaldy Ampatuan, governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao. Andal Ampatuan Sr., the patriarch, became ill and was hospitalized after he too was taken in. ""Local government will function, it will prevent armed groups from wreaking havoc ... and it will allow the officials to search and find the guilty parties,"" Brawner said. Security forces on Friday searched the home of Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay and son of the provincial governor of Maguindanao, according to Brawner. Authorities say Andal Ampatuan Jr. directed the November 23 politically motivated killings. Weapons were found in the house, Brawner said. On Tuesday, Philippine authorities charged Ampatuan and other suspects with 25 counts of murder in the killings. Still more suspects were taken into custody Friday. The Philippine military is investigating its own forces in connection with the case as well, Brawner said. The National Bureau of Investigation has moved a third witness to Manila for questioning, the Philippines News Agency reported Thursday. ""At the moment, we are interviewing the witness, so that we would know what he knows about the incident in Maguindanao,"" NBI Director Nestor Mantaring said. The witness claimed to have been at the site during the massacre. ""He is very vital,"" Mantaring said. ""From what I know ... he knows a lot of information regarding the incident."" Among the victims in the massacre were the wife and sister of political candidate Ismael ""Toto"" Mangudadatu, who had sent the women to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao. He said he had received threats from allies of Gov. Andal Ampatuan, the father of the accused mayor, saying he would be kidnapped if he filed the papers himself. Witnesses and local officials have blamed the younger Ampatuan, a longtime ally of the Philippines president and a known warlord. They said the killings were an attempt to block Mangudadatu from challenging him in the May gubernatorial election. Also killed were a dozen journalists who had accompanied the women. Violence in the run-up to elections is not uncommon in the Philippines. The Maguindanao massacre, however, is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippine history, according to state media. Maguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly Muslim Mindanao, which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the predominantly Christian Asian nation. Suspicion fell on Ampatuan after a government construction vehicle was found at the hastily dug mass grave that held the bodies of the massacre victims. CNN's Talia Kayali contributed to this report.","NEW: Martial law invoked to impose peace on the region after unrest .

Tough love: Ohio businessman Ron Kronenberger was charged with assault after allegedly whipping his tenant. He is now accused of attacking a second man . An Ohio landlord accused of whipping a tenant with a belt on his bare buttocks for falling behind on his rent - is alleged to have beat another man with a belt and a paddle. When Ron Kronenberger's tenant failed to come . up with $2,800 in back rent, the Ohio businessman allegedly did what . many landlords can only dream of: he took off his belt and gave the . 29-year-old a whipping. He is now accused of beating a second man - who is believed to be mentally disabled - with a belt and a paddle at his office at a supermarket. This time the accusations came in a lawsuit filed this week in Warren County, according to the Dayton Daily News. Kronenberger is alleged to have attacked the first man in his office on January 22. Police in the village of Waynesville said the 53-year-old was charged with one count of misdemeanor assault stemming from the bizarre altercation in the back office of his supermarket. According to officials, angered that the tenant had failed to come up with the considerable rent payment, Kronenberger told him that if he was going to act like a child, he would treat him like one. He then allegedly hit him four times with a belt, leaving 'small marks’ on his rear. Police say the tenant later told them he was scared and just wanted to get it over with, so he complied with Kronenberger’s demand to bend over, placing his hands on a chair. An arrest report states that when confronted by Police Chief Gary Copeland, Kronenberger admitted to whipping his tenant. 'Spanking scene': Police say the 29-year-old victim came into Kronenberger's back office inside Hometown Market, where the business owner told him to bend over . The Dayton Daily News reported that Kronenberger, who owns Hometown Market in town, is a former chamber of commerce president who was voted in 2006 as Waynesville's Citizen of the Year. Residents in the small community of 2,800 were shocked by the arrest of the prominent local businessman, but some told ABC22 that they can understand his frustration with the insolvent tenant. A magistrate said he would dismiss . the assault charge in six months if Kronenberger has no contact with the . tenant and stays out of trouble. Police say they have no record of the second incident. Kronenberger and his lawyer declined to comment.","Ohio businessman Ron Kronenberger allegedly whipped disabled man .

Sheryl Crow accompanied Lance Armstrong on a trip to receive an illicit blood transfusion and later told federal investigators all about it, it has been claimed. A new book, entitled 'Wheelmen: Lance Armstrong, the Tour de France and the Greatest Sports Conspiracy Ever' claims the musician traveled in a private jet to Belgium with Armstrong for the 2004 procedure. 'Rather than try to hide the transfusion from her, Armstrong was completely open about it,' authors Reed Albergotti and Vanessa O'Connell write. New book: Sheryl Crow, left, saw Lance Armstrong, right, receive an illicit blood transfusion and later told federal investigators all about it, it has been claimed . Albergotti and O'Connell, who are both Wall Street Journal reporters, claim that Armstrong wasn't fussed if Crow saw what was going on, explaining it was something all cyclists did, according to The New York Daily News, which published an excerpt of the book today. 'He trusted that Crow would have no desire to tell the press or anyone else about the team's doping program.' The couple, who were briefly engaged, were just dating at the time. But Crow didn't spill the beans about the overseas trip until five years after their relationship ended in 2006. That's when federal investigators launched the criminal probe into the apparent Tour de France superstar. Latest on the doping scandal: 'Wheelmen: Lance Armstrong, the Tour de France and the Greatest Sports Conspiracy Ever,' pictured, is released next Tuesday . The latest account claims Crow informed on Armstrong after Food and Drug Administration criminal investigator Jeff Novitzky gave her a proffer agreement, protecting her from criminal prosecution if she told the truth. A representative for Crow did not offer a comment to the Daily News. Blood transfusions boost athletes' endurance by increasing the number of oxygen-carrying red blood cells in their bodies. These were just one of the many tools Armstrong used as well as banned substances to propell him to the top of his sport. 'Wheelmen,' due out next Tuesday, also discusses what Armstrong's other friends and supporters knew of his drug taking.","'Wheelmen: Lance Armstrong, the Tour de France and the Greatest Sports Conspiracy Ever' claims the singer traveled to Belgium with Armstrong for the 2004 procedure .

Usually when thieves are caught carrying out their crimes, they are said to be caught red handed, but not this adventurous pickpocket in China. Instead of using his fingers to grab this man's smartphone from his pocket, he is instead filmed using a pair of chopsticks. But unfortunately for him his skills don't seem to be up to the task as he quickly drops the mobile, causing the unsuspecting victim to turn around and foil the crime. Scroll down for video . A man has been caught trying to steal a phone from another man's pocket using chopsticks in China . The video starts with the thief (in black) and the victim (in grey) lounging around on a street corner . As the victim moves towards the wall the criminal moves around behind him and tries to grab his phone . In the short clip the criminal makes several attempts to take the mobile from the man, at first crouching down behind him in order to get into the right pocket of his hoodie. As the unsuspecting victims moves to lean on a wall the pickpocket has no choice but to follow beside him. He is nearly discovered when the victim moves his arm and almost touches the thief's hand. Undeterred the man keeps tugging at the phone, but is forced to abandon the attempt after the phone owner turns his head, hiding the sticks under a hat he is carrying to avoid detection and leaving the mobile hanging tantalisingly out of reach. But he is soon back at it, and after a few more pulls he manages to get the mobile in his grasp, and tries to quickly put it into the hat to avoid getting fingerprints on it. As the phone owner moves to the right of the picture the thief follows him with the sticks in his pocket . The thief risks detection with his determined efforts to take the man's mobile away from him . He eventually manages to get the handset, but while trying to slip it into this hat he drops it . But he tries to do it too quickly, and at the last second drops the handset on to the floor, causing a noise which the victim obviously hears as he suddenly turns around. For a moment the two men stand frozen, as the victim can hardly believe he is looking at his own phone on the floor. The less-than-master thief pats down his pockets, perhaps trying to pretend that the phone is his, before walking away once the victim has gone in for a closer look. As the mobile falls to the floor the criminal pats his pockets, as if tying to pretend it was his phone . It is not the first time a chopstick thief has been caught picking pockets in the country. Back in April last year Wang Hongbo, 32, was snapped lifting the phone from a woman’s pocket as she cycled through Zhengzhou, the capital of central China’s Henan province. Photographs show him running after the unsuspecting cyclist along a busy road. The pictures were posted online and after national news coverage, Hongbo handed himself in to the police.","A man has been caught using chopsticks to pickpocket people in China .

"(CNN) -- David Waller has some simple advice for anyone looking to improve morale at their organization -- even if it's not the easiest advice to follow. IAEA deputy director David Waller calls Nobel ""a bolt of lightning"" for his staff . ""I say to them, jokingly, 'Why don't you try winning the Nobel Peace Prize?' "" he said. Waller, deputy director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, knows what he's talking about. The organization, based in Vienna, Austria, and dedicated to the safe and peaceful use of nuclear power, was awarded the prize in 2005. President Barack Obama was the surprise winner Friday of this year's peace prize. But for most of this week's other winners, the honor marks a leap from relative obscurity to a spot in the international limelight. Waller said the scientists, authors, activists and others receiving Nobel honors this week should be prepared for an experience that will change their lives in the months and years that follow. ""The day that it was announced that we were winning the Nobel Peace Prize, I can assure you that it was like a bolt of lightning that went through this place in terms of energizing staff and giving people a sense of self-worth,"" he said. ""It was absolutely remarkable."" In all, 172 people and 33 organizations were nominated for the peace prize-- although the Oslo, Norway-based Nobel committee had not announced who its finalists were. The peace prize is one of five awards handed out annually by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden. The other four prizes are for physiology or medicine, physics, chemistry and literature. Starting in 1969, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel also has been awarded. The peace prize is the last of the awards to be announced this week and the Riksbank prize will be awarded Monday. Even for an organization like the IAEA, a United Nations affiliate that traces its roots back to 1957, things were never the same after receiving the revered award, Waller said. ""Many, many things changed,"" he said. ""The number of applications we had for positions here, which was already high, skyrocketed. People returned phone calls very quickly. The whole spectrum of things of that nature changed."" Elizabeth Dobie-Sarsam, a media specialist with the agency, remembers the day it received the Nobel -- she was on vacation and asleep on her sister's floor in Canada when it was announced. ""For three years running, we had been sitting on the edges of our chairs hoping that we won,"" she said. ""That year, for some reason, we thought, 'Oh, forget it. We're not going to get it.' "" The trip back to Vienna would have taken her too long to handle the initial rush of attention, so she finished her vacation, with family members introducing her as ""the Nobel Peace Prize winner"" for the rest of the week. Months later, Dobie-Sarsam said, she was still working to keep up with a flood of media interest in the agency spurred by the award. She said that, four years later, the award still contributes to a feeling of unity among the agency's more-than 2,000 employees who come from over 100 different countries. ""That flush of excitement, unfortunately, it goes away with time,"" she said. ""[But] you do get reminded. You walk through the corridor and you see that certificate hanging -- it's acknowledgement that what we do is incredibly important."" The Nobel recipient receives a prize of 10 million Swedish crowns, or about $1.4 million, another life-changer for many recipients. But Waller said it's the recognition of what the Nobel panel called the ""incalculable value"" of his agency's work that helps when employees are having a hard time with their sometimes slow, frustrating work. ""I think it's a continuing energizer for our staff,"" he said.","Deputy director says Nobel was ""bolt of lightning"" for staff .

"By . Jack Doyle . and James Slack . PUBLISHED: . 20:46 EST, 23 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 20:46 EST, 23 February 2014 . Justice Secretary: Chris Grayling said new laws would stop serial offenders who think they can put up 'two fingers to the system' Criminals who repeatedly flout the law after getting out of jail will be forced to serve their full sentence behind bars, Chris Grayling said today. A loophole in the rules means the vast majority of offenders who break the terms of their early release get just 28 days back inside before they are let out again. The loophole applies even if they breach their licence conditions again and again. But in a new toughening of release rules from the Justice Secretary, repeat offenders will face remaining in jail until the end of their original sentence. Last night Mr Grayling told the Mail it would stop serial offenders who think they can put up ‘two fingers to the system’. He said: ‘Like the rest of the public, I’m fed up with offenders who think they can just put two fingers to the system and act like it doesn’t apply to them. It does. ‘That’s why we are closing the loophole for those who just think they can just time and again flout their licence conditions and get away with it. ‘Offenders need to understand that there are tough consequences for poor behaviour - that’s part of how we can tackle reoffending to make sure communities are safer, and that there fewer victims of crime.’ The change will mean a group of serial offenders serving, on average, an additional eight months behind bars before they are released. The new law affects criminals who persistently break the conditions of their licence after getting released from prison, usually at the half way point. These conditions can include wearing a tag, not returning to places where they commit crimes, or staying away from victims. At the moment, the vast majority spend just 28 days in prison for breaches of their licence regardless of how many times they have broken the rules. They can only be kept inside for longer if they present a ‘high risk’ of causing serious harm to the public. Reduced: At the moment, the vast majority spend just 28 days in prison for breaches of their licence . But when the new law comes in to force, offenders who are ‘non-compliant’ will stay in jail until the Parole Board says they can be trusted not to break the rules. If the Board decides they will still break the rules, they will stay inside until the end of their jail term. The new rules are among a series of changes to be debated by MPs today as the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill returns to Parliament. The flagship Bill also includes longer sentences for perverts caught with sickening pornographic videos depicting rape and a new ‘tax’ on criminals to make them pay for the costs of the courts. Another central pledge is to end the scandal of police officers doling out repeat cautions to thousands of criminals. Progress: The new law affects criminals who persistently break the conditions of their licence after getting released from prison, usually at the half way point . Every year nearly 10,000 criminals get a caution for the same offence they committed within the previous two years. But a ban on repeat cautions will mean serial offenders hauled before the courts for every new offence. It is expected that around 14,000 fewer cautions will be issued each year.","Loophole means some offenders who break terms get 28 days back inside .

Not because they have anything personal against the Germans, but because they are still feeling the anger and desperation after barely qualifying for the tournament in Brazil. Sakho has been France's vice captain since the second leg of the World Cup playoffs against Ukraine. With the team trailing 2-0 after a dire performance in Kiev, Sakho scored in a 3-0 win, and his passionate performance sparked a remarkable turnaround.

Since then, France is unbeaten in eight games and has kept six clean sheets. 'Of . course I still have the rage inside me from that game,' the Liverpool . defender said Wednesday. 'We all have a little bit of that rage inside . of us.' France is vastly . more inexperienced than Germany, which has reached at least the . semifinals of each major competition since the 2008 European . Championship. By contrast, France is rebuilding and has not reached any . semifinal since the 2006 World Cup. But several fresh talents have revamped the national team - which only has two regular starters older than 29. 'We're . a very young team with new players,' Sakho said. 'We've instilled a new . spirit into the team - off the pitch, first of all - and it reflects on . the pitch. 'We know that Germany is a big team, a big football nation,' Sakho added. 'But we're also very good and I believe in us.' At . 24 years old, Sakho is the oldest of France's new generation and has . played 22 times for his country. He was rested against Nigeria after . failing to shake of a left hamstring injury but is fit again to face . Germany on Friday at Maracana Stadium. Besides . Sakho, Paul Pogba has established himself in midfield and Raphael . Varane has done likewise in central defense. Meanwhile, Antoine .

'Everyone . sits together at the dinner table, there's no difference,' Sakho said. 'After the meal last night eight of us stayed at the table to talk about . football and about life in general. It was brilliant.' Some . change from Euro 2012, when players formed cliques and went straight to . their rooms after finishing their meals. It was even worse at the 2010 .

Just like any other new house, it had to be built in line with modern building regulations and is highly insulated with double glazing. The luxury treehouse even has underfloor heating.

Gill Churchill, assistant general manager at the hotel who manages bookings for the treehouse said: ‘It was screaming out to be put to good use. ‘It's the biggest the builders have ever put together. ‘When people come and stay the reaction is always really positive. ‘Nobody can believe that they are actually living in a tree house and that there's a roll-top bath and a dish washer nestled up in the trees. ‘Each person finds something different that they love about it.’","Treehouse is housed inside 200-year-old oak tree in Devon .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 08:13 EST, 20 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:44 EST, 20 September 2013 . Children should be limited to spending no more than an hour and a half playing computer games, Nick Clegg declared today. The Deputy Prime Minister said he ‘rationed’ the time his three sons had with their games consoles and parents face a ‘heavy duty on our shoulders’ to prevent children suffering harm. And he warned of the ‘corrosive effect’ on players’ personalities when they spend hours ‘hunkered down in front of their computer’. Family: Nick Clegg, pictured with wife Miriam, said parents had a heavy responsibility to limit the time children play computer games . Mr Clegg was challenged about the impact of computer games after yobs mugged a fan who had become one of the first to the new Grand Theft Auto V — battering him over the head with a brick and knifing him in the back. The Lib Dem leader said his three sons Antonio, 11, Alberto eight and Miguel four played tennis and football games and not the 18-rated Grand Theft Auto. But he warned: ‘Even for very small kids they just get very wound up with these games so you have to try and ration them a bit. Clearly these games can have an incredibly powerful, and I suspect in some cases corrosive, effect on someone’s behaviour, someone’s outlook. ‘They get shut off, they don’t talk to other people, they just stay in their living room, their bedroom, hunkered down in front of their computer. ‘They occupy a sort of hermetically sealed world really of their own, and that can have a very detrimental effect.’ Popular: Hundreds of fans queued in anticipation of buying Grand Theft Auto V in Oxford Street, London, this week . He said many parents struggled in a ‘frightening unknown world’, and age restrictions were not enough. ‘But . in a free country what do you do, do you start saying to people they . can’t use it for more than x number of hours, no you can’t do that. ‘All . parents, we’ve got a heavy duty on our shoulders, a heavy . responsibility on our shoulders, particularly for those of us who didn’t . grow up with these games.’ Mr Clegg said he sits alongside his sons to watch what they are playing before calling time on the games. Copycat: Teachers warn children are increasingly copying the content of games, like Grand Theft Auto V . Asked how many hours is suitable on a Saturday night, he replied: ‘Not much, about an hour and a half on a Saturday night.’ The Association of Teachers and Lecturers has carried out research suggesting video games are  increasing violence among primary school-aged children. Alison Sherratt, president of the ATL said she was worried about the impact on children: ‘Until now, we’ve been warning of the dangers of children seeing these games, but saying it’s the parents responsibility to keep children away from them. 'We’ve had children crashing into others in toy cars in the playground. When asked about it they say they’ve been watching Grand Theft Auto. They are quite open about it — children of nine and ten.’","Deputy Prime Minister says he limits three sons' games use to 90 minutes .

"University of Delaware students are being offered counseling after a doctoral student allegedly hid video cameras in restrooms around the university's Newark campus over a two-year period. Police were alerted after a hidden camera was discovered in a women's restroom on June 27, the university said. An investigation led to the arrest of 38-year-old Javier Mendiola-Soto, a doctoral student from Mexico. Mendiola-Soto has been charged with 21 counts of violation of privacy. His visa has been revoked, and he is in custody. Police searching Mendiola-Soto's home found approximately 1,500 computer video files. ""The analysis concluded that the suspect hid video cameras in other restrooms both on and off campus over a more than two-year period from 2012 until his arrest this month,"" the university said in a statement. ""The scope of the recordings continues to be a focus of the investigation, and the police are attempting conclusively to identify all potential recorded locations."" Recordings have been traced to two restrooms at the Delaware Biotechnology Institute -- where Mendiola-Soto worked -- a unisex bathroom in the building housing the education department, and women's restrooms in a library, memorial hall and laboratory, the university said. The investigation has so far identified approximately 40 potential victims. Police are contacting victims, and the university is offering counseling  to anyone who requests it in connection with the case. ""It is extremely disturbing that this crime was perpetrated against our community invading the privacy of so many women on and around this campus,"" university President Patrick Harker said. ""We have implemented several actions already, including security sweeps of all restrooms and changing rooms on all campuses, randomly timed examinations of all restrooms by custodial staff and increased police patrols throughout buildings,"" he said. The university's head of campus and public safety, Skip Homiak, said new technology had increased the risk of such crimes. ""Invasions of privacy crimes are becoming an increasing concern on college campuses and in public areas given the ready access to small and sophisticated spying devices,"" he said. The university said the investigation was being conducted ""under strict guidelines and protocols designed to protect the privacy of any individual whose image may have been captured on video."" The video evidence is being securely stored and will be destroyed after criminal proceedings end, it said. Police say they don't think the images have been uploaded to the Internet or shared. People who think they may have been recorded should contact the University Police Department hotline at 302-831-4800.","A University of Delaware student allegedly hid cameras in restrooms around campus .

"Missionary: Maud Kells, 75, from Cookstown, County Tyrone, who was shot twice by gunmen as they raided her home in north-east Congo . A British missionary who received an OBE in the New Year Honours List was shot twice by bandits who raided her home in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Gunmen shot Maud Kells, 75, in the shoulder during an armed robbery at her home in Mulita in the north east of the country. A spokesman for her Christian aid organisation, WEC International, said: 'She was stable last night, speaking, recognising people, drinking water. 'She has no broken bones, no major muscles hit and her bleeding has stopped.' Ms Kells, from County Tyrone in Northern Ireland, has worked in the Congo since 1968, initially as a missionary nurse, and has helped train  Congolese nurses in five hospitals and 30 health centres. She also conducts bible school teaching, speaks at church services, and supervises construction projects. She was awarded an OBE in the Queen's New Year Honours List for a lifetime's work at the medical centre in the Congo. Although she has previously lived in the Congo for stretches of up to four years at a time, she now spends part of the year there and the other part at home in Cookstown. Politicians in Northern Ireland said they were shocked to hear about the shooting. Ulster Unionist Assembly Member for Mid-Ulster Sandra Overend said: 'Only a few days ago we heard the news that Maud is to be awarded a great honour from Her Majesty the Queen and now today, this terrible news that she has been shot doing her work in the Congo is shocking. 'I am sure that I share this sadness with so many people from Cookstown and across Mid-Ulster. 'Those that know Maud will hope that her usual determination will provide her with strength to recover from this terrible incident.' Ian McCrea, a Democratic Unionist Party Assembly Member for Mid Ulster, said: 'My thoughts and prayers are with Maud Kells tonight as she recovers from being shot twice in the shoulder.' A map shows the location of Mulita, north-east DRC, where Ms Kells was living when she was attacked . Pious: Ms Kells has worked in Congo since 1968, initially as a missionary nurse, latterly training Congolese nurses. She also teaches in bible school, speaks at church services, and supervises building projects . The WEC International spokesman said a primary school had been named after Ms Kells where she works. She is also a well-respected member of Molesworth Presbyterian Church in Cookstown. He said doctors in the Congo were assessing her condition last night and considering whether to send her to Kampala for further treatment. WEC director in Ireland Norman Cuthbert said the news about Ms Kells was very good, given that she could have been more seriously injured. 'Maud is a very, very strong lady. She has a very strong faith, I am sure Maud will recover, although it has been a very frightening experience for her.'","Maud Kells said to be in stable condition with no broken bones or bleeding .

"Santiago, Chile (CNN) -- Chile's Chaiten volcano has been placed under red alert due to an increase in seismic activity for three weeks, the Chilean government said. The volcano in southern Chile became active in May 2008 after being dormant for more than 9,000 years. Volcanic activity was on the decline in the past few months until picking back up January 21, the Chilean Interior Ministry said in a news release Monday. The red alert, which indicates activity is above normal levels and an eruption could be imminent, was enacted in large part to protect tourists in the area, said Carmen Fernandez, director of Chile's National Emergency Office. Underground seismic rumblings 1.2 to 5 miles (2 to 8 kilometers) deep in the area around the volcano and constant gas eruptions in the dome indicate ""a high grade of instability,"" the National Emergency Office said.

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods will predictably be among the favorites for this week's Masters Tournament, but another name slipped into title contention on Sunday. Hunter Mahan's victory at the Houston Open lifted him up to fourth in the world rankings, higher than any other American who will be playing at the golf season's opening major at Augusta National. Mahan's one-shot victory over Sweden's Carl Petterson launched him to the top of the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup standings, but more importantly he showed a new mental strength that may help him win one of the sport's four biggest events this year. ""I felt like this week my mind was probably the strongest part of my game. That's a great thing to feel for sure,"" he told the PGA Tour's official website after becoming the first two-time winner of 2012, following up his victory at the World Match Play Championship in late February -- when he beat McIlroy in the final. ""When you play a major, you're going to have to have all facets of the game, especially your mind has to be a strength. What I'm going to take from this week is that my mind was so strong, I was able to persevere through some ... you know, having the lead and doing something I haven't done before.'' The 29-year-old had won three PGA events before this year, but is perhaps best known for his emotional defeat in the final game of the 2010 Ryder Cup teams event when he broke down in tears after losing the decider to Europe's Graeme McDowell. ""I felt like I could be a good player in this game, but to win twice this year and be fourth, it feels great, really does. It shows me what I can do, shows me what I'm capable of,'' Mahan said. ""I wasn't reaching my potential, in a way. I think great players, when you see them, their head is always up. They never seem to get down. They might get upset over a shot, but don't get down on themselves over a shot. It just never seems to bother them. ""You also watch Tiger ... I played with him last week. He's just got that confidence and that swagger back where it's just head up, chest back and ready to go play. You got to be positive in this game -- it's too hard. Hitting a good shot might be hitting it 30 feet (from the pin). You don't have to hit it (to) two feet for it to be a good shot.'' Mahan said he is enjoying the game more with his new approach. ""I think I'm just tired of doing it the wrong way,'' he said. ""What I was doing before, it stunk. It wasn't any fun. We play so many holes, play so many tournaments -- it just doesn't make sense to beat yourself up, you know, because the game is hard enough.'' Mahan said he had thought about skipping the Texas tournament, where he had finished in the top eight three times in five years. But the prospect of having to spend extra time at such a daunting place as Augusta, where he has twice made the top 10 in the last three years, made the decision to play at Redstone a simple one. ""I didn't like the idea of spending so much time there before the tournament, and the hardest part of that tournament is Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, because you're just sitting around and seeing the course. You can't wait to get started,'' he said. Mahan will seek to preserve a remarkable statistic in a sport where good putting is often the difference between success and failure -- he has not three-putted in 102 holes, more than five and a half rounds of golf. But one player missing from the Masters field is South Africa's three-time major champion Ernie Els. The 42-year-old, twice a runner-up at the Masters, needed to win in Houston to earn a starting place but finished six shots back and will not line up at Augusta for the first time since 1993. Petterson finished on 15-under 273, one shot ahead of 2010 British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen of South Africa, who fell away from contention with a 75. Three-time Masters champion Phil Mickelson tied for fourth on 276 in a group including 2011 PGA Championship winner Keegan Bradley.","Hunter Mahan climbs up to a career-high fourth in golf's world rankings .

Claims: Sofia Arif claimed her husband, accountant Arif Anwar Zar, ran the family finances with an iron grip and hid his money behind 'sham debts' to friends and a son from his first marriage . The estranged wife of a multi-millionaire claimed today he faked bankruptcy to dodge a divorce payout as she begged a court to protect 'financially weaker spouses' in break ups. Sofia Arif claimed her husband, accountant Arif Anwar Zar, ran the family finances with an iron grip and hid his money behind 'sham debts' to friends and a son from his first marriage. Mr Zar, 56, who denies the accusations, declared himself insolvent with debts totaling £2.3million, four months after his wife - who his 20 years his junior- filed for divorce in June last year. However, his wife’s barrister, James Ewins, claimed all but £400,000 of that is owed either to his adult son from a previous marriage or to two 'friends'. He told the judges: 'The husband has relied in his bankruptcy on at least £1.9million of sham debts allegedly owed by the husband to his own son, Raziz Rehan (from a previous marriage), and two friends. 'It is the wife’s case that most, if not all, of what Raziz Rehan claims to own is in fact held by him for his father, and his father can call on it whenever he wants.' Telling the judges that Mr Zar also claims his half of the former matrimonial home is beneficially owned by his son, Mr Ewins said. 'This is a case of a true pater familias who owns all the family wealth no matter in whose name it is held. 'In the absence of the sham debts, the husband would not have been balance sheet bankrupt because he would have remaining assets of at least £1.6million. Venue: The hearing, at the Royal Courts of Justice, followed an appeal by Mr Arif against a judges order that the challenge to his bankruptcy be heard before a divorce judge, rather than a specialist commercial judge . 'The husband had made a thinly veiled threat that he would make himself bankrupt and that, in doing so, he knew exactly what he was doing. 'The husband and his creditors are, on the wife’s case, perpetrating a fraud against her, an innocent third party in the bankruptcy... none of that is surprising but neither is it fair or just,' the barrister added. The hearing followed an appeal by Mr . Arif against a judge’s order that the challenge to his bankruptcy be . heard before a divorce judge, rather than a specialist commercial judge . in the High Court Chancery Division. Asking for the issue to be decided by a family judge, Mr Ewins said the i'nquisitorial' nature of the divorce courts would subject Mr Zar’s financial dealings to deeper 'scrutiny'. Lord Justice Thorpe allowed the husband’s appeal at the end of a half-day hearing, with reasons to be given at a later date. Mrs Arif’s bid to have her husband’s bankruptcy annulled will now be heard by a Chancery judge, separately from her financial claim in the divorce courts. Both hearings are expected to go ahead later this year.","Sofia Arif begged judges to protect 'financially weaker spouses' in divorce battles .

Being kept up at night by the sound of neighbours or because you live on a busy road is not uncommon - but a French couple was left sleep deprived and depressed because of a noisy peacock next door. The husband and wife, from Marseille in southern France, sued the town hall after they alleged that they had been left depressed and suffering from insomnia because of the animal's persistent squawking. The couple said that they both had to resort to psychotherapy because of the noise. A peacock (not the bird pictured) drove a French couple to seek psychological help after they were kept awake by a noisy peacock . The peacock was given to the local mayor . in 2008 as a present. But the bird often escaped its pen and had been . running loose in the 9th district of Marseille - next to the Maison Blanche park in the city. In 2009, after the bird had escaped numerous times, council workers were sent out to the park to find the peacock but were unsuccessful in finding the perpetrator. The peacock was eventually found and shipped off to a farm outside Marseille. In court, medical documents were shown confirming that the couple had been suffering from insomnia and depression. In 2012, the pair tried to sue the town hall but were awarded just £82 in compensation. Outraged, they opened the case again this year and were paid out £1,658 in damages after a court concluded that the council had not done enough to control the bird. After claiming legal costs, the couple received a total payout of £3,316.

"London (CNN) -- Nearly four decades after he brought an invasion of mutant, flesh-eating rodents to London with his first novel, ""The Rats,"" UK chiller writer James Herbert has died aged 69. Herbert, who followed up his best-selling debut with another hit, ""The Fog,"" and another 21 books over the decades, was seen as a British rival to U.S. horror supremo Stephen King. Other top sellers include ""Portent,"" ""Others"" and ""The Secret of Crickley Hall."" His most recent novel, the paranormal detective story ""Ash,"" was published last year. Publisher Pan Macmillan said that he died peacefully at home Wednesday morning. Jeremy Trevathan, Herbert's editor at Macmillan for 10 years, described him as a ""keystone author in a genre that had its heyday in the 1970s and 1980s."" He was published in 34 languages, including Russian and Chinese, and has sold more than 54 million copies worldwide, according to Pan Macmillan. ""It's a true testament to his writing and his enduring creativity that his books continued to be huge bestsellers right up until his death,"" said Trevathan. ""He has the rare distinction that his novels were considered classics of the genre within his lifetime. His death marks the passing of one of the giants of popular fiction in the 20th century."" Fans of his books paid tribute to the indelible mark they left on the readers' psyche. ""Sad news about James Herbert -- as a teen, I scared myself silly reading him. He led me to King, Barker, others. RIP ... "" said crime writer Ian Rankin on Twitter. Broadcaster Jenni Falconer tweeted: ""Sad news about James Herbert. His book series 'The Rats' has kept me on high alert whenever I'm on the tube!! (I read it 20 yrs ago!)"" Born in the East End of London, the son of street traders, Herbert grew up in Whitechapel -- where Jack the Ripper once stalked his victims -- in an area badly hit by Second World War bombing raids. The rodents he saw scurrying around the ruined buildings were to inspire his first work, according to a fan website. The manuscript for ""The Rats,"" published in 1974 at 175 pages in length, was written in just 10 months while Herbert was working at an advertising agency. He had found a job there after studying graphic design, print and photography at Hornsey College of Art, and eventually rose to a senior role. Four of his novels were made into films, while another was serialized for television and a fifth was dramatized for radio. Herbert was presented with an honor, the Order of the British Empire, by Queen Elizabeth II in 2010. In the same year, he was made the Grand Master of Horror by the World of Horror Convention. He lived in Sussex, in southern England, with his wife of more than 40 years, Eileen, with whom he had three daughters.","James Herbert died peacefully at home, his publisher says .

"A Central Coast man  is in a critical condition after being punched in the back of the head in a 'one-punch' incident outside a pub on the NSW central coast. The 24-year-old Wyong man was found unconscious by emergency services when they were called to the car park of the Woodport Inn, in Erina, around 12.45am on Saturday. Police were told that the man was punched in the back of the head by another man following an argument, causing him to fall and hit his head on the pavement. The 24-year-old Wyong man was found unconscious by emergency services when they were called to the car park of the Woodport Inn, in Erina, around 12.45am on Saturday . The Bonnal Rd establishment had been hosting Australian electro DJ Timmy Trumpet at the time of the incident, who labelled the act of violence 'heartbreaking'. 'It's truly heartbreaking to hear about something happening like this and my thoughts are with him, his family and his friends,' the DJ told The Sydney Morning Herald. 'I'm against violence in any capacity and incidents like this are exactly why,' he said. The young man was taken to Gosford Hospital with serious head injuries, and was later transferred to Royal North Shore Hospital in a critical condition. 'It's truly heartbreaking to hear about something happening like this and my thoughts are with him, his family and his friends,' said electro DJ Timmy Trumpet (pictured), who was playing at the venue . In 2013, the NSW Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing listed the The Woodport Inn as one of the 16 most violent venues in the state . A spokesperson from the hospital said that he remains in a serious but stable condition. Following investigations, a 22-year-old man was arrested at a home on Nirvana Street, Long Jetty. He was taken to Gosford Police Station, where he was charged with cause grievous bodily harm to person with intent. The man has been refused bail, to appear at Gosford Local Court on Sunday. In 2013, the NSW Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing listed the The Woodport Inn as one of the 16 most violent venues in the state, a title which was removed in 2014, reported The Sydney Morning Herald. The NSW government introduced new 'one punch' laws for unlawful assault, which came into effect on in January 2014. The sentence carries a 20 year maximum sentence for anyone who 'unlawfully assaults another who dies as a direct or indirect result of the assault,' said Government's website set up for the introduction of the laws. The young man was taken to Gosford Hospital with serious head injuries, and was later transferred to Royal North Shore Hospital in a critical condition . 'If the offender was intoxicated by alcohol or drugs, a minimum of eight years and a maximum 25 year sentence applies.' Police are appealing for public assistance to help identify the man involved, and have described the man as having a solid build, with a shaved head, wearing dark pants and a white shirt. Police are urging anyone with information in relation to this incident to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or use the Crime Stoppers online reporting page.","24-year-old man was punched to the back of the head in the car park of the Woodport Inn in Erina, on NSW Central Coast .

"A Connecticut high school principal and assistant principal have been charged with failing to report a sexual relationship between a teacher and a student. Stamford High School professor Danielle Watkins, 32, is facing two charges of second-degree sexual assault for an affair with her 18-year-old pupil between September 2013 and June this year. But police claim the liaison could have been stopped earlier as principal Donna Valentine and assistant head Roth Nordin were made aware of the situation as early as December 2013 and did not report it. Charged: Stamford High School principal Danielle Valentine, 62, and assistant headteacher Roth Nordin, 59, are facing fines of up to $2,500 for failing to report an affair between an English teacher and her 18-year-old pupil . Now, Valentine and Nordin both face a fine of up to $2,500 each as state law requires school officials to report any suspected relationship between and adult and a student. The student told police he was afraid to report the affair because Watkins, a married mother-of-two, threatened to fail him. Eventually, when he finished the school year in June, the student told a guidance counselor who told the school and the Department of Children and Families. However, according to police, the school had already conducted an independent investigation into the affair before he went to the counselor, but they had not notified the Department of Children and Families. Valentine's attorney, Mark Sherman, says the charges are only accusations and don't reflect the principal's long commitment to the safety of her students. Affair: Danielle Watkins, 32, handed herself in to police after the student reported their eight-month liaison . Family: Watkins, an English teacher who allegedly threatened to fail the boy when he tried to break off their relationship, is pictured with her husband and one of their children . Watkins, who taught English at the school, turned herself in to police in July. She has also been charged with drug possession as she allegedly bought marijuana for the student and his 15-year-old friend - whom she also taught - and let him drive her car while knowing he did not have a license. Her two students smoked the drug during school hours, sometimes on school grounds, the older boy told police. On June 26, three days after telling the counselor about the affair, he went to Stamford Police to make a statement about the relationship. The 15-year-old boy also gave a statement to police. On June 27, police officers pulled over Watkins' car and inside they found marijuana and a cell phone, which contained evidence she had sent naked photos of herself to the boy. Secret: She also allegedly provided the Stamford High School (pictured) pupil with marijuana . Lt. Diedrich Hohn, in charge of the case, told MailOnline that she was 'hostile' and 'verbally combative' during the search. As cops pulled her over, she had tried to hide her cellphone under the passenger seat, he said. Watkins allegedly exchanged more than 2,000 text messages and hundreds of phone calls with the teenager. She was released on $100,000 bond and she is scheduled to appear in court July 31 after being charged her with sexual assault and sale of marijuana in regard to the first victim and sale of marijuana and risk of injury to a minor in connection with the younger boy.","Connecticut teacher Danielle Watkins 'had an eight-month affair with one of her students and sent him nude pictures of herself'

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Marlon King arrives at Nottingham Crown Court where he was jailed for 18 months today for dangerous driving . Former Premier League footballer Marlon King has been jailed for 18 months today for dangerous driving. The ex Sheffield United striker was driving erratically and eating ice cream behind the wheel when he caused a three-car pile up on the A46 in Nottinghamshire last April, the court heard. The footballer was seen weaving in and out of traffic before slamming on his brakes - causing another driver to perform an emergency stop. Other drivers then smashed into his vehicle, Nottingham Crown Court heard. One driver had to be cut out of his car before spending three weeks in hospital for a fractured and dislocated forearm. King pleaded guilty to a charge of dangerous driving in March. Sentencing King in court today, Recorder Paul Mann QC said: 'I do not regard your case as merely impulsive or silly behaviour. 'It was aggressive. It was arrogant.' The judge handed King 18 months behind bars and a three-year driving ban. The court heard that King committed the offence on his 33rd birthday while driving a white 2011 Porsche Panamera. He was eating an ice cream he had bought from a McDonalds just moments before the crash, which happened at around 3pm on April 26. King was seen weaving in and out of traffic before he undertook Martin Beck, whom he perceived as travelling too slowly in the outer lane of the A46, the court heard. The former footballer slammed on his brakes in frustration, forcing Mr Beck to perform an emergency stop in his black VW Polo. As Mr Beck came to a halt, another driver in a silver Vauxhall Astra who had pulled out behind him, collided with the stationary Polo. The 'concertina effect' forced the Polo into the back of King’s Porsche. Mr Beck had to be cut out of his car and airlifted to hospital after the collision at Winthorpe near Newark. He spent three weeks in hospital and required surgery for a fractured and dislocated forearm. Mark Bush, who was travelling in the Astra, was also taken to hospital for cuts and bruises. The court heard how the ex-footballer was weaving through traffic on the A46 in Nottinghamshire while eating an ice cream from McDonald's. He then slammed on his breaks, causing a three-car pile up . The court heard that King drove off from the scene but was flagged down by another motorist who feared Mr Beck had been killed by the collision. King returned to Mr Beck’s car, where he blamed the driver for the collision. The judge told King: 'You were so pumped up with road rage, you had to start accusing him of being to blame for these collisions'. King, born 26 April 1980,  is a professional footballer who plays as a striker. He was given an 18-month jail sentence following a conviction for dangerous driving today. As of October 2009, King had convictions for 14 offences. He has previously served three jail sentences and has other criminal convictions including: fraudulent use of vehicle licence document, driving without insurance and theft from a person and from a car. He was also convicted of two cases involving assault of young women rejecting his advances in the Soho area of London in December 2008. King had his playing contract cancelled by Wigan after being convicted of the sexual assault charges. He was sentenced to eighteen months in prison.","Former Sheffield United striker Marlon King jailed for dangerous driving .

In the UK, life expectancy for a boy born in 2012 is 79 and for a girl it is 83, meanwhile in the U.S. it is 76 and 81 respectively. But are your habits and lifestyle knocking years off your life?

Fruit . and vegetable intake is also taken into account - in particular the . quantity of fruit juice, salad, fruit, salad, potatoes and carrots . consumed each week. Later questions relate to exercise; how many hours are spent a) jogging or running and b) playing ice hockey, soccer, basketball, volleyball, or rollerblading. Activities such a walking, cycling, gardening, golfing, bowling and fishing are calculated as leisure time. Finally, stress levels, health conditions (such as heart disease and diabetes) and household income are factored in. TAKE THE TEST HERE . While the health dangers of smoking are well known, research is increasingly showing . that being obese and/or sedentary may be just as bad. Last month, .

"A Mormon man has taken a smiling selfie for every day he was on a lonely two-year missionary stint because it reminded him to be happy. Gabriel Guerrero, of Salt Lake City, Utah, said taking a selfie every day while on his Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints mission was not just a way of recording his experience, but it also kept him smiling when things got tough.

'I saw a lot of people online doing selfie videos, but I didn't see any missionary ones,' Mr Guerrero told the Deseret News. 'The funny thing was that I initially was going to not smile as the others had done, but then as I was doing it, I thought to myself, ""This is a happy thing! I should be smiling!""'

He would announce to the others that he was about to take his daily photo and they would each try to photobomb it.

"(CNN) -- Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan has told CNN that Indian cinema needs to move beyond traditional song-and-dance musicals amid increasing international competition in the Mumbai studios' domestic market. Bachchan, India's favorite film star and a regular presence in Bollywood productions for four decades, said that Indian audiences exposed to Western television and cinema expected Indian movies to be ""at least on a par with is happening in other parts of the world."" ""Technology means the common man has access to the very best in entertainment from other parts of the world almost instantly,"" the 67-year-old told Connect the World. He said Indian audiences were dictating that Bollywood move away from the studio's traditional musical love stories to deal with more serious themes. ""We do want to make different kinds of films and I think recent not-so-successful releases have indicated that audiences in India are now wanting to move away from the traditional format of escapist commercial cinema and see cinema with a greater amount of meaning,"" Bachchan said. Bachchan said his latest movie, ""Pa,"" in which he plays a teenager with an aging disorder which means he looks older than his own father -- played by Bachchan's son, Abhishek -- was an example of a new style of film with broader appeal which Bollywood was capable of making. Asked whether he would ever consider roles in Hollywood to show the world his versatile talent, Bachchan said: ""I don't think there is a great amount of versatility in my performances."" But he added: ""If there was an offer that was of interest then I would most certainly look at it.""","Amitabh Bachchan says Bollywood needs to move beyond traditional movies .

"(CNN) -- It seems no-one in South Africa can fail to be gripped by World Cup football fever. The running, tackling, shooting, offside-appealing proof comes with a clutch of grannies who have been playing in a fiercely competitive league around the Nkowankowa township, 600 kilometers north of Johannesburg. A squad of 35 nans down domestic duties twice a week to take to the field for their team Vakhegula Vakhegula, and compete against seven other teams in the region. Some of them even credit the beautiful game as having turned their lives around. ""I like to play soccer because it helps,"" said Nari Baloyi, who at 47-years-old, clocks in as one of the youngest players. ""We were sick, but now our temperatures, our blood pressures... have gone down ...even our doctors are amazed when we go for a check-up."" One of the more elderly members, Nora Makhubela, is convinced that football has given her a new lease of life following the setback of suffering six strokes. ""My life has really changed...if I were to run with you I would beat you even though I'm much older,"" she said, throwing down the gauntlet to the likes of Ronaldo, Messi et al. ""My life has improved because of the football. I wish God could bless the person who came up with this great idea."" The women contribute around $1 a month each for footballs, kit, and travel to the bi-annual regional tournament. Dozens of noisy fans cheer on the players, with the distinctive sound of the vuvuzelas -- a South African trumpet -- creating an atmosphere that would be welcome at any European Champions League tie. Makhubela is hoping her new-found love of the game extends long enough for her to be able to watch some of the matches when the World Cup begins in June. ""I pray every day to God to keep me alive until 2010. I would really love to watch the games,"" she said. The team was formed three years ago to offer older women a chance to exercise and come together as a group, says community worker Beka Ntsanwisi. ""Some of them couldn't even walk properly and if they did something in their free time they would be knitting or sewing and sitting all the time...here they run, shout, fight with you...it keeps them young,"" she said. David Maake said his job coaching the team is the best he's ever had. ""With young boys you need more money to achieve many things...here, I may come with my stress...but I will laugh so much until I forget everything,"" he said. The team have even suggested they play a curtain raiser for the main event itself, a brainwave the footballing authorities have said they will give serious thought to. If the women do manage to take part as an hors d'oeuvre to the World Cup proper one thing is for sure, what they lack in skill they will make up for in enthusiasm.","Grannies in a South African township have taken up football .

"The 50-foot Christmas tree decorating downtown Reading, Pennsylvania, was supposed to spread holiday cheer, but instead it made some residents unhappy. ""It looks sad,"" City Council President Francis Acosta told CNN affiliate WFMZ last week. ""Everybody's calling it a Charlie Brown tree."" A group called Christmas for Downtown Reading raised $1,000 from business and community donations toward purchasing a replacement tree, but a last minute change of heart means the original tree that was denigrated far and wide on the Web will stay in place. Acosta had earlier vowed to replace the tree that observers called ""pathetic,"" ""ugly"" and an ""embarrassment."" The puny Norwood spruce had already lost many of its branches, even though it's not yet December, and it was sparsely decorated with a simple string of lights. ""If there was a squirrel looking for a place to live in the winter, it wouldn't even go into the tree,"" remarked one passerby. City workers arrived Monday to remove the lights and prepare the old tree for transport to City Park to make room for a newer, better tree. But Acosta granted the tree a last-minute reprieve, according to WFMZ, saying he now wants to leave the tree that has gained so much notoriety in place as a draw for visitors to the downtown area. ""We will keep this thing here and we will call it the 'ugly tree' that everyone and national television is calling it, and we're going to see it as an opportunity to bring people to downtown Reading,"" said Acosta. He told WFMZ that letting the old tree stay put would free up municipal workers to prepare the city for a coming snowstorm. Acosta is soliciting more donations to help decorate the tree better. The new tree is still being delivered and will be on display elsewhere in the city, say officials. The debate over whether to replace the tree is annoying some residents even more than the ""ugly"" tree did. ""It's frustrating that they can't make a decision on their own and go with it,"" Reading resident Zachary Lee told the local news station. ""We can't afford to just be sending these [public works] guys here. There's a lot of other stuff these guys need to be doing, and we want to complain about this tree when there's other parts of the city that are nowhere near as pretty as this tree, that people don't find any beauty in.""","UPDATE: Reading, Pennsylvania, will keep the Christmas tree some called ""ugly"" downtown .

"An elderly truck driver who killed a 43-year-old woman and injured her mother as they walked on a New York street will not face criminal charges. Police said James McDonald, 86, veered across East Genesee St in Syracuse, hitting college professor Jennifer Cook and her mother, Barbara Cook, in March. Jennifer Cook died in a nearby hospital, while her 72-year-old mother suffered critical injuries but was later released. McDonald, however, has not been charged over the death. He was let off with a ticket for passing a red light and failing to keep right, Syracuse Police Sergeant Gary Bulinski told Syracuse.com. Tragic: Rhode Island College professor Jennifer Cook (pictured left and right) was killed when driver James McDonald plowed his truck into her in March . Loving family: Jennifer Cook (third from left, back row) is survived by her spouse, Moira Collins (fourth from right, back row) who is also a professor . Sgt Bulinksi said police actively investigated the crash and neither McDonald's age or the weather seemed to be factors. He said McDonald, from Chittenago, held a valid driver's license and was not involved in recent accidents. The road was also clear. McDonald refused to comment when contacted by Syracuse.com. 'I don't care to talk about it, sorry,' he said before hanging up. The tragic incident unfolded on March 14 when Jennifer Cook and her mother were walking to a restaurant for lunch after a doctor's visit about 1.15pm. Cook, a Rhode Island College English professor, was in Central New York to visit her dying 93-year-old father, Frank Cook. Syracuse.com reported that McDonald plowed into the Cooks after swerving to avoid rear-ending a stationary vehicle ahead of him. The women were rushed to Upstate University Hospital where Jennifer Cook, from Rhode Island, died from her injuries. Her father Frank Cook died two weeks later. Scene: Police said James McDonald, 86, veered across the 900 block of East Genesee Street in Syracuse (pictured), near Phoebe's restaurant, hitting two pedestrians . Jennifer Cook's tragic death shocked and saddened students and staff at Rhode Island College, where she'd worked since 2004. 'Dr. Jennifer Cook was a well-liked and well-respected member of the English department and of the educational studies department,' college president Nancy Carriulo said in a statement, according to Providence Journal. 'We all thought that Jen, who was tenured a few years ago, had a long career ahead of her at Rhode Island College.' Cook, who received degrees from American University and the University of Massachusetts, was the executive director of the Rhode Island Writing Project which worked to train young teachers. 'She was a really extraordinary teacher. She had such an amazing impact on her students,' Ronald Pitt, vice president of academic affairs at RIC, told Providence Journal. 'It was an amazing thing to see her work.' English department chair, Daniel Scott, said Cook 'inspired and trained hundreds of students who are now teachers in Rhode Island and around the country'. Cook is survived by her spouse, Moira Collins, who is also a professor.","James McDonald, 86, plowed a pickup truck into Jennifer Cook and her mother Barbara Cook on a Syracuse road on March 14 .

"Legislation to allow same-sex marriage in England and Wales won passage Tuesday in the House of  Commons. The vote was 366 for, 161 against. The bill now goes to the House of Lords, where it will face further opposition. A rebellion within Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative Party threatened to derail the bill. Tuesday brought the second day of discussions on the legislation. Members of Parliament voted Monday on a series of amendments to the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill. Cameron backs the bill but his commitment to it has put him at odds with many in his own party and its grassroots supporters. The Conservatives govern in coalition with the Liberal Democrats. The bill was kept on track Monday thanks to the support of members of the opposition Labour Party, who voted to oppose an amendment that many Conservative rebels backed. Same-sex marriage: Who will legalize it next? The amendment, which was put forward by MP Tim Loughton, proposed extending civil partnerships to heterosexual couples as well as same-sex couples. Minister for Women and Equalities Maria Miller, the sponsor of the same-sex marriage bill, argued that this would result in significant expense and delay, thus derailing the whole bill. Labour leader Ed Miliband tweeted Monday: ""David Cameron's inability to control his party must not be allowed to wreck the Equal Marriage Bill. Labour's commitment unwavering."" A law recognizing civil partnerships in England and Wales was passed in 2004. The Church of England is among the religious bodies opposed to the new legislation. The issue of same-sex marriage has exposed painful divisions within Cameron's party, with many lawmakers already fractious over his position on Europe. Under pressure, Cameron's government last week published a draft bill promising a referendum by 2017 on Britain's membership of the European Union. The Conservative Party faces a political threat from the UK Independence Party, which has vowed to take Britain out of Europe. Controversy has also blown up following weekend UK media reports that quoted a senior ally of Cameron describing party activists as ""swivel-eyed loons."" In an effort to dampen the flames, Cameron sent an e-mail late Monday to party supporters, according to UK media reports, saying he was proud of their work and would ""never have around me those who sneered"" at them. Same-sex marriage around the world . The issue of same-sex marriage has also prompted wide disagreement elsewhere. On Saturday, French President Francois Hollande signed into law a bill allowing marriage and adoption for same-sex couples despite vocal opposition from many conservatives and the Catholic Church. The step made France the ninth country in Europe to allow same-sex marriage. If Uruguay and New Zealand enact legislation approved by their lawmakers as expected, the count of nations worldwide allowing same-sex marriage will rise to 14. The first same-sex couples walked down the aisle in the Netherlands in 2001, with others following suit in Canada, South Africa, Belgium and Spain. Argentina was the first Latin American nation to legalize such marriages, in 2010. Other countries on the list are Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Portugal and Sweden. Many countries remain split over the issue. A Brazilian court this week issued a directive removing a barrier that had limited same-sex marriage, but no bill has made it through Congress. In the United States, the question went before the Supreme Court and justices are deliberating over the matter. Twelve U.S. states and the District of Columbia have legalized same-sex marriage. On the other side, many states have specific laws blocking same-sex couples from legally marrying. UK lawmakers approve same-sex marriage in first vote .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has given a girl's parents the go-ahead to sue a Massachusetts school district over alleged sexual harassment by another student. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling allows a couple two avenues to pursue claims against their daughter's school district. The justices, in a unanimous ruling, allowed the plaintiffs two avenues to make their claims -- a 1972 law banning gender bias in education and a separate civil rights law enacted 138 years ago. Lisa and Robert Fitzgerald said their then-kindergartner daughter was forced by an older male student to lift her skirt or pull down her underwear. The parents alleged school officials ignored their concerns and refused to discipline the boy. Federal courts had been split over whether the newer law -- known as Title IX -- displaced any claims made under part of the 1871 civil rights law, called ""Section 1983."" The Fitzgeralds lost their initial Title IX claims and an appeals court blocked them from pursuing the other legal strategy. The ruling from the justices now gives the Fitzgeralds the right to continue their lawsuit against school officials. ""We hold that Section 1983 suits based on the Equal Protection Clause remain available to plaintiffs alleging unconstitutional gender discrimination in schools,"" Justice Samuel Alito wrote. The plaintiffs allege the incidents happened on a school bus in Barnstable, Massachusetts, in the 2000-01 academic year. The child had told her parents that whenever she wore a dress, a third-grader would make her do things she did not want to do. After the mother complained to school officials, the boy denied the allegations. The principal, after interviewing other students and the bus driver, concluded she could not corroborate the girl's version of events. The principal suggested the girl be transferred to another bus as a possible solution. The Fitzgeralds said that amounted to punishing their daughter and said the boy was the one who should be transferred. The local police department also looked into the case but concluded there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against the boy. The parents began driving the girl to school and filed a lawsuit, claiming the schools system's response was inadequate. School officials denied wrongdoing and tried to limit the case to Title IX, which applies to public or private schools receiving federal aid. The law is credited, among other things, with helping bring equality in sports participation and funding for college women. ""Our concern was that the school district just didn't take things as seriously as they should,"" said Charles Rothfeld, attorney for the Fitzgeralds. ""They were frustrated by what they perceived as indifference by the school."" Rothfeld said the school's behavior was ""pretty egregious."" Barnstable school officials did not respond to a request for comment. The case is Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Cmte. (07-1125).","Parents allege older boy sexually harassed daughter on school bus .

"(CNN) -- Dani Pedrosa won a thrilling last-lap duel with championship leader and fellow Spaniard Jorge Lorenzo to claim Sunday's Czech MotoGP in Brno. Pedrosa and 2010 world champion Lorenzo swapped the lead on the 22nd lap of the 5.4-kilometer circuit before the Honda rider claimed a memorable third win of the season. He has cut Lorenzo's lead in the title race to just 13 points with six races left in the elite division of motorcycle racing. Yamaha's Lorenzo had led from pole until Pedrosa took the lead halfway through the race. Lorenzo claimed it back only for Pedrosa to move ahead for the final time and take the checkered flag. ""It was half a lap to go and I was a little more nervous than before but... on almost the last corner I got along with him, he tried to release the brakes and we were head-to-head into the corner, but I could... win the race,"" he told the official MotoGP website. Britain's Cal Crutchlow claimed the first podium spot of his MotoGP career on his works Yamaha ahead of Italian teammate Andrea Dovizioso, who will replace Valentino Rossi at Ducati next season. But they were over 12 seconds behind the leading pair, who dominated from the start. Last year's Brno winner, world champion Casey Stoner of Australia, was absent with a fractured ankle and has conceded his title defense is over as he needs surgery. Stoner will retire at the end of the season and his Repsol Honda team has announced he will be replaced by 19-year-old Spanish prospect Marc Marquez, who will move up from the Moto2 division having been the 125cc world champion in 2010.

"By . Laura Cox . PUBLISHED: . 17:07 EST, 2 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:30 EST, 3 October 2013 . 'Healthy': Presenter Donna Air, believed to be a UK size 4, says her body is natural and she eats healthily . She is the first to admit ‘I’ve been a skinny girl my whole life’. But Donna Air has now expressed her horror at discovering that images of her are being used on pro-anorexia websites to encourage girls with eating disorders to lose more weight. Miss Air, 34, is being used as ‘thinspiration’ for sufferers who are starving themselves and are desperate to lose more weight. Celebrities including supermodel Kate Moss, and presenter Fearne Cotton have all featured on the sites, on which anorexics offer tips and motivation to their followers. But those used as pin-ups are largely unaware that their pictures are being used. And today Miss Air, who is currently dating James Middleton, brother of the Duchess of Cambridge, said she was ‘alarmed’ to hear she has become ‘thinspiration’ material. She said: ‘I didn’t realise I was on any sites and I certainly can’t take responsibility for something as huge as that,’ she said when alerted to the sites. 'I hope these girls get the help they need.’ Miss Air is believed to be a UK size 4 and appears to have recently lost weight. But she insisted she has a ‘healthy’ body image and is a positive role model to her daughter Freya, 10. She said: ‘I’ve been a skinny girl my whole life. I just don’t sit down – I’m always on the go. 'It must be down to the genes. We have a healthy body image in my house and great appetites. 'It’d be hard for you to find a food I don’t love.’ Miss Air, who rose to fame on the children’s television drama Biker Grove, is known to take Bikram yoga classes to stay in shape. The intense classes, which last 90 minutes long, take place in around 40 degree heat and are a favourite among celebrities including Gwyneth Paltrow. Today a leading education commentator said she feared ‘stick-thin’ celebrities could have a negative effect on young girls. Helen Wright, who has been a headmistress at some of the UK’s leading schools, said: ‘No-one is a good role model for anorexics wishing to get thinner; anorexia is a complex psychological illness, but it is exacerbated by the contributing factors of ‘celebrities’ seeking to be stick-thin. 'We need better for our daughters. ‘Parents should be very worried about pro-anorexia websites. 'They promote incredibly unhealthy behaviours around food and lead to potentially fatal consequences. Distraught: Miss Air, who is dating James Middleton, brother of Kate, said she loves all food and always has . 'There is nothing good about these sites, . and anyone in the public eye who finds themselves associated with them . should be prepared to denounce them in the strongest terms.’ It comes after experts warned young girls were being driven to eating disorders by super skinny models like Cara Delevingne. Miss Delevingne, who is the face of some of the world’s biggest fashion brands, and her ‘thigh-gap’ became an object of fascination for teenagers. They shared tips on how to get legs that, . like Miss Delevingne’s don’t meet above the knee. And they pledge to . starve themselves to reach their goals. However experts said a ‘thigh-gap’ was neither natural nor healthy. 'Thinspiration': Young girls force themselves into starvation to get a 'thigh gap' like model Cara Delevingne . And today a spokesperson from an eating disorders charity warned that images of celebrities are often airbrushed leading to unrealistic perceptions of beauty. Leanne Thorndyke, from b-eat, said: ‘Pro-anorexia sites are dangerous in that they frequently encourage people to believe that eating disorders are a life style choice and not the serious mental illness that they truly are. ‘Pro-ana sites can encourage people to avoid treatment, and that can be life threatening. Eating disorders have the highest death rate of any mental illness. ‘One typical feature of a pro-ana site is the so called ‘thinspiration’ pictures of famous people looking very thin. These pictures are frequently digitally altered to make them appear even more slender than in real life.'","Television presenter is used as 'thinspiration' for girls starving to lose weight .

"(CNN) -- The 222nd El Clasico -- a match between Barcelona and Real Madrid which epitomizes the ultimate in team rivalry -- turned into an individual showcase for the two greatest players in world football and fittingly ended in a 2-2 draw Sunday. Barcelona's Lionel Messi scored twice to put his side 2-1 ahead in their Camp Nou Stadium after an early strike from Real's Cristiano Ronaldo. But the Portuguese star drew the reigning Spanish champions level on the hour mark with his second goal and almost certainly kept their title hopes alive. They trail leaders Barcelona by eight points after seven games, 11 would have been almost insurmountable. A draw was probably a fair result although it is unlikely the majority of the 98,000 fans who crammed into Barcelona's magnificent home stadium would have agreed. Because at stake is not just the result of a football match but the very pride and honor of the Catalan people. Independence calls . Many from this semi-autonomous region of Spain want full independence and last month more than a million people demanded just that in a demonstration in Barcelona. Former Barca manager Pepe Guardiola publicly supported that ambition, which has gathered pace in the austerity-hit country, with many Catalonia citizens believing they are paying more than their fair share into the coffers of the government in Madrid. This feeling of Catalan identity embodied in a football club is summed up by Barcelona's motto ""mes que un club"" -- more than a club, and clashes against Real Madrid are chances to give vent to their feelings. Austerity gives El Clasico added twist . The passionate atmosphere Sunday went up a notch as Barcelona officials allowed fans to display the yellow and red colors of Catalonia in a giant mosaic, holding up cards to get the effect. And at exactly 17 minutes and 14 seconds, chants for independence rang out in reference to the Catalans' military defeat to the Royalists in the War of Spanish Succession in 1714. Political football . Barcelona's central defender Gerard Pique had tweeted Saturday that he wanted politics to say out of El Clasico. ""The games between Barcelona and Madrid increasingly resemble Catalonia against Spain and this should not happen,"" he wrote. ""It's just a football match."" Whether all his fellow players agreed with Pique, they certainly missed him in defense as he was ruled out by injury. The full throated chants had barely subsided when Ronaldo ran through a big gap in the Barcelona back line and shot past Victor Valdes on 22 minutes. It was a record sixth goal in six matches against Barcelona and Real would be left to rue a miss by Karim Benzema soon afterwards which might have led to a different result. His mishit shot hit the post and by halftime Messi had equalized after hesitation in the Real defense. Is this El Clasico a must win game for Real? In the second half, Messi was fouled just outside the Real penalty area and got up to send an unstoppable free kick past Iker Casillas. But Ronaldo replied when weakness at the heart of the home defense was again evident and he equalized with a low shot. Both sides had chances to grab the three points but had to settle for a draw. Controversial invite . The political undertones behind the latest El Clasico found further expression in the decision by Barcelona to invite Gilad Shalit, a former Israeli soldier who was held captive in Gaza for nearly five years. It risked alienating their many supporters in the Palestine region and the Hamas government called for a boycott of the television coverage. Barcelona responded by inviting a former Palestine international player Mahmoud Sarsak, who had been detained by the Israelis, but he declined to come.","Barcelona draw 2-2 with Real Madrid in El Clasico .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Lashing winds and heavy rain pummeled India's southeastern coastline Friday as Cyclone Thane roared onshore killing at least 19 people. The storm uprooted trees, ripped off traffic signals from their posts and sent shards of glass and other debris whizzing through the air. Roads began to flood and communications were tough because of cellular service outages. Thane hit the states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu and the union territory of Puducherry. But it took a decidedly southern turn as it made landfall, severely affecting the Tamil Nadu district of Cuddalore, south of the city of Chennai. Winds were gusting in Cuddalore at almost 90 miles per hour. At least 12 people died in Cuddalore, said Amuthavalli, the district's top official who goes by a single name. She told CNN the fatalities were the result of wall collapses and electrocution. No major rescue operations were required. The death toll in the district is not expected to rise greatly, she said. Emergency crews were working to restore power supplies and clear roads of fallen trees and downed power lines, she added. Meteorologists downgraded Cyclone Thane from ""very severe"" to ""severe"" once it came over land and began to lose steam. By lunchtime, it had weakened further to a ""deep depression"" as it moved westward. Fishermen were advised to stay off rough seas throughout the day and coastal residents had been told to evacuate to higher ground ahead of the storm's arrival. Many people in largely agricultural and fishing communities along the coast live in thatched-roof huts that could sustain extensive damage, the India Meteorological Department said Friday. Parts of coastal and inland Tamil Nadu and Puducherry can expect heavy rainfall over the next day, the agency said. Heavy rain is also forecast for parts of Andhra Pradesh, as well as northern Kerala and southern Karnataka.

"(CNN) -- A Christian woman in Sudan reportedly has until Thursday to either recant her faith or face a possible sentence of death. Meriam Yehya Ibrahim, 27, was convicted by a Khartoum court this week of apostasy, or the renunciation of faith, Amnesty International said Wednesday, a day before the expected ruling. The court considers her to be Muslim. According to the rights group, she was also convicted of adultery because her marriage to a Christian man was considered void under Sharia law. ""The fact that a woman could be sentenced to death for her religious choice, and to flogging for being married to a man of an allegedly different religion, is abhorrent and should never be even considered,"" Manar Idriss, Amnesty International's Sudan researcher, said in a statement. ""'Adultery' and 'apostasy' are acts which should not be considered crimes at all, let alone meet the international standard of 'most serious crimes' in relation to the death penalty. It is flagrant breach of international human rights law,"" the researcher said. Ibrahim is eight months pregnant and currently in custody with her 20-month-old son, according to Amnesty International, which considers her a prisoner of conscience. Christian Solidarity Worldwide, another rights group, described Ibrahim's case as follows: . She was born to a Sudanese Muslim father and an Ethiopian Orthodox mother. Her father left when she was 6 years old, and Ibrahim was raised by her mother as a Christian. However, because her father was Muslim, she was considered by the courts to be the same, which would mean her marriage to a non-Muslim man is void. In past cases involving pregnant or nursing women, the Sudanese government waited until the mother weaned her child before executing any sentence, said Christian Solidarity Worldwide spokeswoman Kiri Kankhwende. After-hours attempts Wednesday to contact the Justice Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister in Sudan were unsuccessful. Foreign embassies in Khartoum are urging the government there to reverse course. ""We call upon the Government of Sudan to respect the right to freedom of religion, including one's right to change one's faith or beliefs, a right which is enshrined in international human rights law as well as in Sudan's own 2005 Interim Constitution,"" the embassies of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Netherlands said in a statement. ""We further urge Sudanese legal authorities to approach Ms. Meriam's case with justice and compassion that is in keeping with the values of the Sudanese people,"" it read.

"(CNN) -- Los Angeles may have become famous for many things over the years -- Hollywood and the Oscars to name but two -- but downtown living is not one of them. What big star of the silver screen could resist the lure of suburban mansions in Bel Air and Beverly Hills after all? Now, a host of new city developments aim to change all that. At least half a dozen major real estate projects are underway in the LA's downtown areas and several others are in the works. One of the largest development will see property firm Mack Urban turn a collection of parking lots in the city's South Park district into 1,500 new apartments. ""We anticipate our build out taking between eight to ten years so this is a long term investment and development plan,"" explained Paul Keller, CEO of Mack Urban. The company intends to invest up to $750 million in South Park, enticed by the proximity of the nearby LA Live complex which includes the Staples Center -- home of the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers, the Nokia Theatre, and several hotels, restaurants and bars. This will attract a clientele who are looking to live, work and play in the same area, Mack Urban hopes. ""What's driving investment and development here in South Park has really been the continuation of a massive investment that AEG (Anschutz Entertainment Group) made beginning with the development of the arena here in downtown,"" said Keller, in reference to the Staples Center. All in all, South Park can expect to see nearly 300,000 square meters (3.2 million square feet) of residential and hospitality living come online by 2020, according to commercial real estate firm JLL. JLL also say land sales in the area now average nearly $500 dollars per square meter ($47 per square feet), more than double what the going rate was just five years ago. International investors like Greenland Group are paying close attention to these numbers. The Chinese real estate investment firm have already spent more than $140 million on a 2.5 acre parking lot that they plan to transform into a massive condominium project called Metropolis. ""We see a lot of opportunity here for education and also for urban living,"" said Ifei Chang, CEO & President, Greenland USA. ""We believe this should be also with the domestic population, it should be an international community here right in the city."" Greenland expects to spend up to a billion dollars on building the Metropolis and expects that projects like theirs -- along with planned infrastructure improvements like the LA streetcar project currently in build -- will make downtown living the next trend in Los Angeles. If the planets biggest movie stars are spotted moving into the South Park district in the coming years, then they can judged to have been correct. See also: Suburbia gone wild .

"A sex-obsessed doctor has had his license suspended after he was accused of a series of bizarre acts while on duty. Dr Arthur Zilberstein's 'preoccupation with sexual matters' included using medical images for sexual gratification and having sexual encounters at his workplace, it is claimed. The anesthesiologist, from Seattle, Washington, also allegedly sent explicit texts while performing C-sections and naked selfies to a patient.

The charges, filed with the state Medical Quality Assurance Commission, also allege that Zilberstein prescribed unauthorized narcotics to a female patient he had sex with, NBC News reported. On one day alone, June 17, 2013, he is accused of sending 64 texts, many just minutes apart, during seven surgeries, many of which had sexual innuendos. One read: 'I'm hella busy with C sections.' Another read: 'Oh. And my partner walked in as I was pulling up my scrubs. I'm pretty sure he caught me.' Dr Arthur Zilberstein is accused of sending pictures 'depicting himself in hospital scrubs, wearing his hospital badge and exposing his genitals' Swedish Medical Centre in Seattle, where Arthur Zilberstein worked, has suspended him . The charges state: 'Respondent's lack of focus on patient care while providing anesthesia services for hospital-based surgical procedures routinely fell below the standard of care and put patients at unreasonable risk of harm.' Zilberstein also demonstrated 'moral turpitude' that reflected badly on the medical profession. Zilberstein cannot practice until the charges are resolved, health officials said. He has 20 days to respond to the charges and request a hearing, officials said. He was contracted through Physicians Anesthesia Services with Swedish Medical Center to provide care, NBC News reported. Hospital spokesman Clay Holtzman said: 'The safety of our patients is our number one priority. Once we learned that the state had suspended this physician's medical license, the physician's medical staff membership and privileges were immediately suspended. 'We just recently learned of these allegations and are conducting our own internal review of the physician, who is not directly employed by Swedish.'","Dr Arthur Zilberstein had a 'preoccupation with sexual matters'

"(CNN) -- Warm waters off Peru are to blame in the deaths of more than 5,000 marine birds on the coast, government authorities say. The Peruvian National Center for the Study of El Nino reported earlier this week that since February the Peruvian coast has had an abundance of warm water as a result of marine currents throughout the world's oceans. The warm water has altered the marine ecosystem, it said. The warm water has led fish such as anchovy and other species that live in surface waters to migrate to deeper water toward the south. As a result, pelicans and other birds that feed from the surface of the water died of starvation. ""If these oceanographic conditions persist, it is likely that its impact will spread to other areas of the (Peruvian) coast even during the fall, which could make the numbers increase and affect other marine species"" said the report. The ministry of environment said seafood is still safe to eat, and encouraged everyone to continue to support local fishermen, according to state-run Andina news agency. ""Marine resources are fully guaranteed, so we promote consumption and discard the speculation that some people or institutions disseminated irresponsibly,"" said the deputy minister for strategic development of natural resources, Gabriel Quijandria. Andina reported that Quijandria also clarified the beach warning that had been issued by authorities last week. ""The health alert does not prohibit admission to the beaches, but people are advised to avoid contact with the remains of pelicans, dolphins and other animals that are stranded,"" he said. Officials in Peru continue to search for the culprit in the death of almost 900 dolphins since the beginning of the year. The health ministry is awaiting final results from molecular analysis looking for the morbillivirus, which previously has been linked to dolphin deaths.","Warm waters off Peru have chased away fish, a national center studying El Nino says .

In a commercial for Fiat's new 500L that has struck a chord with mums across the globe, a mother raps about faking orgasms, eating leftover fish fingers and joining a book club as an excuse to drink more wine. The amusing advert, called In The Motherhood, has proved an internet sensation, going viral on YouTube with more than 2m hits. Scroll down for video . Sensation: In the Motherhood, which is a rap on an advert for the new Fiat 500L has had more than 2m hits on YouTube . 'I pop a nappy in his butt without a changing mat.

Her 'hood' is motherhood, her 'itches' are two dogs and her 'babies' are her three children who have turned her house into a bombshell. The departure from the traditional way of selling cars came after Fiat held focus groups looking at how it could market its new product to young families, according to The Sunday Times. Shakespeare actress Donovan created a melody for the chorus and recites lines such as: 'I spent three months in my PJs - it was clearly a sign.

The advert has proved a massive hit but the male board members at Fiat were not sure about the theme at first . Vicki Saunders, a managing director of Krow Communications, which produced the film, said: 'There were a few blank faces around the table and they were brave to take it on because it is risky in places. 'We deliberately wanted to be tongue-in-cheek and for it to connect to British mothers.' The commercial was given the go-ahead after Fiat UK's managing director showed it to his wife, who roared with laughter. Elena Bernardelli, Fiat UK's marketing director, said: 'We wanted to connect with our target audience, starting with dynamic young mums, in a way that demonstrated our understanding of the challenges they face balancing motherhood with their desire to keep hold of their pre-children identity. 'We hope by dramatising the reality of embracing a new life stage in this way will raise a knowing smile from mums everywhere.' Donovan said she was surprised at the popularity of the advert.

"Korean giant LG has become the latest television maker to offer Google's web TV service built in to its flatscreens. Sony already offers the service on a small number of sets in America, and Samsung is to build televisions with the web-TV service, which offers  access to TV from HBO, CNBC and Netflix, as well as web, social networking, apps and games. With backing from big electronics companies, Google's service could hit the mainstream this year - long before the rumoured Apple iTV service goes on sale. The device could be a new version of Google TV, a web-streaming service which the search giant launched in 2010, but which has remained unpopular . Google TV will offers web access via its Chrome browser, and apps and games similar to the ones on Google's Android devices - but all redesigned to be easily usable via a remote control from the sofa. The sets connect to a home internet network, and also offer access to YouTube's steadily increasing number of TV channels. The service has yet to launch in Europe. In America, it has so far met mixed reviews, and widespread indifference. Logitech, makers of one of the first Google TV devices - a set-top box - lost a reported $100 million on their gadgets. Television channels such as NBC have blocked their web-TV offerings from appearing on Google TV devices. But with an increasing number of major tech companies backing it, the service seems to be in with a chance again in 2012. LG's offering will offer Google TV along with 3D. Havis Kwon, LG's CEO  said, 'Through Google TV, LG has merged Google’s established Android operating system with LG’s proven 3D and Smart TV technologies.' The televisions will also have a QWERTY keypad on LG's Magic Remote - making for easier web searches via Google's Chrome browser.

"Just 90 miles away, Cuba inevitably shares a long history with the United States, from conquistadors to the Spanish-American War to the Cold War. Here are some of the top moments in that history, even before the countries came into being. Old World meets New World . Christopher Columbus lands on Cuba in 1492 and claims the island for Spain, leading the way for that country's conquistadors to explore the Caribbean and the part of the U.S. Southeast that's now Florida, among other parts of the Americas. Spanish-American War . The United States helps Cuba win independence from Spain in a war between the European country and the Americans in 1898. In one of the more famous moments, Theodore Roosevelt and his Rough Riders charge up Cuba's Kettle Hill during the Battle of Santiago, and the so-called 1st Volunteer Cavalry become instant heroes. The United States is given temporary control of Cuba under the Treaty of Paris, and Roosevelt later becomes U.S. President. Guantanamo Bay . The U.S. occupation of Cuba lasts until 1902, during which U.S. forces modernize the capital's infrastructure. By 1903, the new Republic of Cuba allows for the creation of a U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay in 1903, whose military moniker becomes ""Gitmo."" Cuban Revolution . In 1959, Fidel Castro, his brother Raul and their band of bearded guerrillas stage a successful communist revolution overthrowing President Fulgencio Batista, a U.S. ally. Fidel Castro goes on to become one of the world's longest-ruling leaders, for more than 50 years, and one of the most vocal critics of capitalism and U.S. policies. U.S. embargo . After the Cuban Revolution leads to the nationalization of about $1 billion of U.S.-owned property on the island, the U.S. government imposes a trade embargo on Cuba in 1960 that's designed to destabilize the communist regime. The Castros refer to this sanction as a ""blockade"" that they claim causes many of Cuba's problems. Bay of Pigs and missile crisis . The United States and Cuba come to the brink of nuclear war following a series of events that begins when U.S.-backed Cuban exiles invade the island at the Bay of Pigs. But the exiles suffer a crushing defeat in 1961, embarrassing the U.S. government. The following year, Cuba allows the Soviet Union to build missile installations on the isle, a major crisis in the Cold War. The standoff ends when the Soviet Union withdraws the missiles and the Americans promise not to invade Cuba.  Secretly, Washington also agrees to remove U.S. ballistic missiles deployed in Turkey against the Soviets. Mariel exodus . Flotillas of rafts and boats carry a mass movement of refugees from Cuba to Florida in 1980. In all, about 124,000 Cuban migrants take to the water and enter the United States. Fidel Castro enabled the exodus by allowing his people to leave Cuba freely from the port of Mariel. Elian Gonzalez . Only 5, Elian Gonzalez is the only boat survivor of a group of refugees fleeing Cuba to Florida in 1999. An international incident erupts during a custody battle between the boy's father in Cuba and his relatives in the United States. At gunpoint, U.S. agents remove the boy from his great-uncle's home, and Elian is returned to Cuba in 2000. Gitmo Part II . After the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, President George W. Bush uses the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base as a detention facility for terror suspects. At its height, the facility hold more than 750 detainees and becomes a flashpoint of controversy about its legality as a prison and about alleged mistreatment of detainees. Under an agreement, the U.S. government sends Cuba about $4,085 a year to lease the land. Fidel Castro, however, is said to have called the U.S. base in Guantanamo ""a dagger plunged into the Cuban soil,"" and the last time Cuba took the U.S. payments was in 1959, when the Castros took power.","The United States helped Cuba win independence from Spain in 1898 .

"(CNN) -- In the tech world, paying a celebrity to love your product can sometimes backfire. On Wednesday, NBA superstar LeBron James took to Twitter to announce a nightmare of the mobile age: ""My phone just erased everything I had in it and rebooted. One of the sickest feelings I've ever had in my life!!!"" Here's the problem: That phone was, presumably, the Samsung Galaxy Note that the Miami Heat star is paid big money to endorse. His was just the most recent in a series of public missteps by celebrities who have been increasingly called upon to create buzz for tech products. James quickly deleted the tweet and soon thereafter -- presumably with some help from his friends at the Korean gadget company -- posted this: ""Close call. Wheew! Got all my info back. Gamer! Lol."" It's not the first time a celebrity, an endorsement deal and Twitter have merged to create an awkward gaffe. Just this month, Oscars host Ellen DeGeneres took the Selfie Seen Round the World with a smartphone from Samsung, a major sponsor of the awards. But, backstage, she was caught tweeting Oscars thoughts from her iPhone. Singer Alicia Keys claimed she was hacked last year (the Anthony Weiner Defense?) when she apparently sent a tweet from an iPhone just days after she was named a ""creative director"" for BlackBerry. And in 2012, Oprah Winfrey (or one of her staff) raved about the new Microsoft Surface tablet -- in a tweet using Twitter for iPad. Sometimes, competing loyalties collide when gadget endorsements are involved. In March 2013, ""The Big Bang Theory"" star Kaley Cuoco tweeted some (sponsored) praise for Dish Network's Hopper, a DVR system. Turns out, CBS, which airs ""Big Bang,"" was locked in a lawsuit with Dish and other DVR makers over the systems' ability to skip ads. She did the obligatory tweet delete. Dish accused CBS of making her. CBS denied it. And the beat goes on. Martin Lindstrom, a brand adviser to Fortune 500 companies and author of ""Buyology: Truth and Lies About Why We Buy,"" said such flubs are ""a major risk"" companies run when they sign up celebrity endorsers.

Danny Alexander will warn today that voters across Britain are flooding their MPs with their concerns at the prospect of Scottish independence . Voters across Britain are flooding their MPs with their concerns at the prospect of Scottish independence, a Cabinet minister will warn today. Liberal Democrat Danny Alexander will attack Alex Salmond’s plan to end the union, calling the Scottish leader ‘a man without a plan.’ He will warn of a long list of potential disasters for the Scots if they vote Yes to independence, from the dangers to pensions and Isas to disruption for entrepreneurs. Mr Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury – whose constituency is in Scotland – says people are ‘rightly starting to worry’, adding that independence ‘opens the flood gates to a sea of uncertainty on currency, rates and regulation’. Speaking in Edinburgh, Mr Alexander will say the Scots have not been told what currency they will get paid in, what money they will use at a supermarket, the denomination of their savings or whether their pension is safe. He will tell the National Association of Pension Funds’ annual conference that letters and emails are being sent from savers worried that their Isas won’t be protected, pension holders worried about the security of their funds and small businesses worried their accounts will ‘soon be with a foreign bank, in a foreign currency’. His concerns echo warnings from a  growing list of major companies. Yesterday the chief executive Shell – the UK’s most valuable company – became the latest to sound the alarm. Ben van Beurden said Scottish independence would threaten the UK’s ‘continuity and stability’. Shell joins the likes of Standard Life, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB and Barclays in speaking out against a Yes vote. Yesterday the power giant Aggreko also voiced its fears, threatening to quit its Scottish headquarters as independence would present ‘a number of risks’. In a clear threat that it could leave . its Scottish headquarters, it said: ‘As a global business, we will have . plenty of options.’ Mr Alexander will attack Alex Salmond's plan to end the union, calling him 'a man without a plan' Speaking in Edinburgh today, Mr Alexander will say: ‘We’re seeing a real increase in the letters and the emails to the UK Government from people worried by those questions.’ At the National Association of Pension Fund’s annual conference today, Mr Alexander will say letters are from ‘savers worried that their Isas won’t be protected'. ‘Pension holders worried about the security of their funds,' he will say. ‘Small businesses worried their accounts will soon be with a foreign bank, in a foreign currency.’ Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at the financial advisers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘If we end up with separate tax rates or a separate currency, it would get even more complicated and costly. ‘The cost of all these changes will inevitable fall on ordinary investors and will reduce their investment returns and retirement incomes.’","Danny Alexander will today attack Alex Salmond's plan to end the union .

"By . Arthur Martin . Victim: PC Blakelock was hacked to death on Tottenham's Broadwater Farm Estate in 1985 . A gang member paid £5,000 for his eye-witness account of Keith Blakelock’s murder told a court yesterday he kicked the officer ten times during the 1985 Tottenham riots. The witness, giving evidence under the pseudonym John Brown, admitted being part of a gang that repeatedly kicked and stabbed the policeman as he lay on the ground. PC Blakelock was stabbed 43 times by a baying mob shouting ‘kill the pig’ as he tried to protect firemen. A knife was embedded in his neck in a failed attempt to decapitate him. The officer ‘was trying to curl up into a ball’ in an attempt to protect himself and screamed ‘help, help, help’, said Mr Brown. The witness’s role in the attack would usually mean he would be prosecuted for murder, the Old Bailey heard. But he received immunity from prosecution, was paid £5,000 and was helped with his rent, phone and car bills after he assisted police in 1993 during a second investigation into PC Blakelock’s murder. Giving evidence from behind a screen and with his voice distorted to protect his identity, Mr Brown said he saw Nicholas Jacobs stabbing the policeman with a machete during the riots. Mr Brown, a former member of the mainly white Park Lane Boys gang, said: ‘I saw him hit a couple of blows on the officer in the shoulder. He was just stabbing up and down with the machete. I saw him do it between two and four times.’ He said he saw a sword, a 15in dagger and the machete allegedly wielded by Jacobs during the ‘frantic’ attack. ‘As he was brought to the ground I started kicking him. I kicked him in the ribs around ten times. I had trainers on,’ said Mr Brown. Asked by prosecutor Richard Whittam QC why he kicked PC Blakelock, Mr Brown said: ‘I don’t know. I just rushed in. It was the excitement of the situation. Tributes: Flowers left at the scene where PC Blakelock was hacked to death by dozens of men armed with everything from machetes to kitchen knives during riots at Broadwater Farm estate in 1985 . Aftermath: Police look at the devastation following the 1985 riots in the Broadwater Farm area of Tottenham . 'I noticed an officer being pulled to . the ground by a couple of individuals. His helmet was knocked off. I . didn’t see where it went. Then it was a free for all. ‘They were shouting things  like, “kill the beasty”, “kill the Babylon”, “get his f****** head on a pole” and “kill the pig”.’ Mr . Brown, who was 20 at the time of the riots, described seeing one . attacker with a long sword stabbing the top half of PC Blakelock’s body . and another stabbing the officer with a short dagger twice in the ribs. He told the jury he was carrying a stick on the night of the murder but had not used it. After the riots Mr Brown pleaded guilty to affray and burglary and was jailed for five years, later cut to 42 months on appeal. Court: With his voice disguised by digital distortion equipment, the prosecution witness told jurors at the Old Bailey (pictured) that he was armed with a stick during the violence on the Broadwater Farm Estate . He . gave evidence against Jacobs when he was tried for affray in 1986, . placing him at the scene but making no mention  of the knife. It was not until 1993 that Mr Brown claimed Jacobs attacked PC Blakelock with a machete. Defence . barrister Courtenay Griffiths QC accused Mr Brown of telling ‘blatant . lies’ and ‘fitting up’ Jacobs so he could get a financial reward. Mr . Griffiths also accused him of colluding with his cousin and an old . friend – two other key prosecution witnesses – to frame Jacobs. Mr Brown . denied the allegations.

French President Francois Hollande today acknowledged the 'suffering' his country had inflicted on Algeria - while refusing to offer an apology to the former colony. Speaking to the Algiers parliament, Mr Hollande admitted that 132 years of direct rule from Paris had often been 'brutal and affair'. Mr Hollande spoke of the savage war of independence, which took place over eight years up until 1962 and claimed around 1.5 million lives. No apology: French President Francois Hollande, pictured in Algiers on Thursday, acknowledged the 'suffering' his country inflicted on Algeria . Increased trade: President Francois Hollande, left, was invited to Algeria by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, right, for the landmark visit amid hopes of a new phase in relations . Torture was used frequently by the French military and security services as the war spread from the North African country to mainland France itself. Mr Hollande said: 'What Algeria was subjected to for 132 years was profoundly brutal and unfair. 'That system had a name - colonialism - and I recognise here the suffering that colonialism inflicted on the Algerian people. 'There is a duty to tell the truth about the violence, the injustices, the massacres and the torture.' Mr Hollande added that official archives needed to be opened so that historians could ensure the 'truth can come out progressively.' Many Algerians had called on Hollande to issue an apology for French rule and for its conduct during the war for independence. Its . deep scars are felt on both sides of the Mediterranean, with a . coalition of prominent Algerian politicians attacking the French for . failing 'to recognise, apologise for and compensate' victims of 'its . crimes. Respect: President Francois Hollande laid a wreath of flowers at the Algerian war memorial . Mr Hollande admitted the 132 colonisation of Algeria had been 'unjust and brutal' Mr Hollande's historic speech came a day after he arrived in Algeria on a two day state visit. He called for a partnership 'of equals' between the two countries, but insisted he had 'not come to offer repentance or apologies. I have come to say what is true.' Mr Hollande's predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, also acknowledged that France's colonial rule on Algeria had been unjust but also failed to apologise. There are up to four million French Algerians in mainland France, and Hollande said he wanted to make it easier for them to travel between the two countries. He is also eager to boost trade, which stands at about eight billion pounds a year, and has been accompanied to Algeria by a number of business leaders. Renault has just announced it is to build a factory in Oran, Algeria, and will produce 75,000 cars each year. Hollande was invited to Algeria by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who will pay a return visit to France. French paratroopers spot check Algerian peasants ten days after a series of attacks that marked the start of the Algerian independence war . The Algerian war of independence lasted eight years and cost the lives of approximately 1.5million people. Hundreds of thousands were also tortured as brutal French tactics were used as part of a 'pacification campaign' to quell nationalist support. Both the French army and the FLN - the Algerian National Liberation Front - targetted civilians during the complex conflict between 1954 and 1962. It was characterised by guerrilla warfare and bloody suppression. A pivotal and notorious event was the Battle of Algiers in 1956 when a general strike was violently broken by the French. General Jacque Massu was told to use any means necessary to break the strike. Independence was finally gained following secret negotiations between the two sides and a referendum granted by Charles de Gaulle, who had returned to power. In the second referendum six million people voted for independence and only 16,000 voted against.","The French president acknowledged the 'suffering' inflicted on Algeria .

The number of casualties was not immediately clear. Professor A.B. Baffa said he was at home on the campus of Bayero University in the city of Kano when he heard the gunfire and explosions. When he went to see what was going on, he said he saw people fleeing and saying gunmen attacked areas where Christians were worshipping. The gunmen began their attack around 8:30 a.m., targeting a lecture hall normally used by Christians for Sunday services, journalist Salihu Tanko reported from the scene. ""Reports say that they came in one vehicle and they also came on the bike and started shooting sporadically and at the same time threw about four or five small locally made bombs,"" Tanko reported. Baffa said police have closed off the area. The attack happened while the university is on a break, so most of the students are not on campus, Tanko said.

Absence really does make the heart grow fonder, as new research reveals Brits who work away from home actually have more sex with their partner. Couples who spend at least one night a month working away from home have a hotter sex life than those who share a bed every night, the study found. Seven out of 10 couples get frisky the night before one of them leaves on business and again when they get back (67 per cent). Romantic: Having a reunion after time apart can reinvigorate relationships, a survey reveals . More than half find being torn away from their lover and then reunited a turn-on (54 per cent), the study of 2,007 couples reveals. Eight out of 10 workers confess being away from the stresses and strains of home makes them more likely to get it on. And one in four admit they’re more likely to be in the mood because they have more energy after a night in bed alone. Couples who spend one to two nights away a month have sex 110 times. That’s nearly twice as much as those who stay away separately less than 12 times per year (average 56 times). A night away together also boosts the chances of romance, according to the report by boutique serviced apartments collection Blue Rainbow Aparthotels. Couples are nine times more likely to get intimate between the sheets when they’re away from home as they feel more relaxed, it shows (88 per cent). Kim McAllister, 29, a dental nurse from Penicuik, Scotland, said: 'My fiance is a recruitment consultant, so he spends one or two nights away every month. 'I’m always sad to see him go, so we usually make love before he goes away. 'Then I’m so refreshed when he gets back that I’m fired up and ready for more when he gets home.' Not so happy families: Sharing a bed every night does not necessarily mean that you will have more sex with your partner . Scottish lovers were the friskiest - seven out of 10 always get passionate to welcome their partner home (76 per cent). Manchester residents are less amorous, with only a third always having sex when reunited (33 per cent). Will Hannah, managing director of Blue Rainbow Aparthotels, said: “We’re over the moon that the environment in our serviced apartments makes our guests feel relaxed. 'If that means the end result is they get amorous when they return home, then that’s an added bonus. 'It’s only natural for lovers to behave in this way when faced with separation, so we’re glad we’re able to help spread the love.'","Scottish lovers are the friskiest while Manchester residents are the least .

"(CNN) -- At least five people have been killed in the grenade attack on a minibus in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, the country's Interior Ministry said Saturday on its official Twitter account. An attacker was among those killed. Other people were injured in the strike, strongly condemned by the ministry. The blast occurred in the predominantly Somali neighborhood of Pangani. The grenade tore through the bus, blew out windows and sent debris flying into the busy street. Security forces were sifting through the wreckage for clues on who might be responsible. The attack is the deadliest in Nairobi since the September siege of an upscale mall by the Somali terror group Al-Shabaab, an affiliate of al Qaeda, where 67 people were killed.","A minibus was attacked .

"Joe Lentini went to dinner at Bobby Flay Steak not knowing much about wine. He left having learned a harsh lesson. Lentini and his companions were taking a business dinner at the Atlantic City restaurant in the Borgata Hotel, and while ordering the wine he asked the server for a recommendation. 'I asked the waitress if she could recommend something decent because I don't have experience with wine,' Lentini told NJ.com. Scroll down for video . Sticker shock: When the diners received the bill, with a wine they thought was only $37.50, they were shocked to find it was more than $4,000 thanks to the bottle of Screaming Eagle . 'She pointed to a bottle on the menu,' a 2011 Screaming Eagle. 'I didn't have my glasses. I asked how much and she said, ""Thirty-seven fifty.""' In the words of Lentini, he thought he meant $37.50, the table approved and the wine was ordered. When the bill came, the host who had agreed to cover the dinner was shocked to find it totaled over $4,000. At the top of the list of items ordered was the Screaming Eagle, but with the staggeringly high price tag of $3,750. In the words of another dining companion Don Chin, when the bill came, 'We all had a heart attack.' The party complained that the waitress had been misleading when she informed Lentini and the other guests about the price of the wine. Misled: Joe Lentini claims he heard the waitress say 'thirty-seven fifty' and only assumed that the bottle only cost $37.50 . High life: The diners in the party had expected an expensive dinner of steak and seafood, but the $3,750 was a shock, especially for Lentini, who did not often drink wine . 100 point: Screaming Eagle is considered one of the best bottles of wine in the world - and is priced as such, fetching over $1000 a bottle at auction . The restaurant offered to drop the price of the wine to $2,200, which the party begrudgingly accepted. 'As the leading culinary destination in this region, we consistently serve as many, if not more high-end wine and spirits without incident,' executive vice president Joseph Lupo said. 'In this isolated case, both the server and sommelier verified the bottle requested with the patron,' said Lupo, who claimed the host did not 'say anything to management.' The unidentified host of the dinner reportedly confirmed to NJ.com that he did learn the price before the bill was handed out, but that the bottle was open and likely empty  so he kept quiet. According to the restaurant's menu, the bottle recommended was the second most expensive for its size. So how was the wine? Self-declared wine amateur Lentini says, 'It was okay. It was good. It wasn't great. It wasn't terrible. It was fine.' For those looking for the experience of enjoying shockingly expensive wine in the comfort of their own home, bottles of Screaming Eagle's 2011 vintage sell at auction beginning around $1000.","Joe Lentini asked the waitress at Bobby Flay Steak in Atlantic City for a wine recommendation for a business dinner .

"Srinagar, India (CNN) -- India detains hundreds of people each year without charge or trial to ""keep them out of circulation"" in the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir, according to a new report released Monday by Amnesty International. The human rights monitoring group documented how India's Public Safety Act (PSA) is used to justify long-term detentions of people, even when there is insufficient evidence for trial. The draconian act has come under repeated criticism from human rights groups who have expressed alarm over Kashmiris caught in the fight between Indian security forces and militant groups in the Himalayan state. The Amnesty report estimated that between 8,000 and 20,000 people were detained in the past two decades; 322 of them were held between January and September of last year when a wave of unrest swept the region and people took to the streets in deadly anti-government protests. ""The Jammu and Kashmir authorities are using PSA detentions as a revolving door to keep people they can't or won't convict through proper legal channels locked up and out of the way,"" said Sam Zarifi, Amnesty International's Asia-Pacific Director. ""Hundreds of people are being held each year on spurious grounds, with many exposed to higher risk of torture and other forms of ill-treatment."" Among the detainees are political leaders and activists, suspected members or supporters of armed opposition groups, lawyers, journalists, and protesters, including children, Amnesty said. The report said that often, people are initially picked up for ""unofficial"" interrogation and have no access to a lawyer or their families. Amnesty said the Indian government has relied on the safety act in dealing with a resurgence of street protests. ""Despite this apparent shift in the nature of the unrest, Jammu and Kashmir authorities continue to rely on the PSA rather than attempting to charge and try those suspected of committing criminal acts,"" Zarifi said. ""The PSA undermines the rule of law and reinforces deeply held perceptions that police and security forces are above the law."" The state's Chief Minister Omar Abdullah denied that so many people had been detained under the act. He said 4,046 people were arrested in the protests. But, he said, 3,900 of them were released and only 28 had been detained. A senior police officer told CNN that about 250 people were detained under the PSA in the past year but some had been released. The Indian state is divided into mostly Hindu Jammu and Muslim Kashmir, where many residents argue that the territory should have been a part of Pakistan when the subcontinent was partitioned in 1947. Polls have found a majority of Muslims in the state favor secession. The Indian government blames Pakistan for furling an insurgency in Kashmir. Tens of thousands of Kashmiris have died in the bloodshed over the years. Khurram Parvez, coordinator of the Jammu and Kashmir coalition of civil societies, said the Public Safety Act gives the Indian government powers to arbitrarily detain detain a person for two years without trial, against India's principles of justice.

"(CNN)  -- Several large circus tents previously used by Cirque du Soleil are on their way to Haiti to be used as a temporary headquarters for the Port-au-Prince government, according to the man donating them. The self-contained tents would replace government buildings destroyed a month ago by the devastating earthquake that killed at least 200,000 people, Nevada real estate developer Tom Schrade said Thursday. An urgent effort is under way to provide shelter for in Haiti, ahead of the rainy season expected to hit the island nation at the end of March. Much of the government is operating in small tents or cramped quarters in buildings that survived the January 12 earthquake. Schrade, who bought the tents after Cirque du Soleil retired them, said his wife got the idea to donate them while they were watching coverage of Haiti relief efforts. ""It seemed like a good thing to do,"" Schrade said. The tents have 33,000 square feet of interior floor space, including heating and air conditioning systems, interior and exterior lighting, toilets and 900 padded chairs, Schrade said. Thirteen steel shipping containers hold the 400,000 pounds of cargo, he said. ""Even the shipping containers can serve as apartments,"" Schrade said. After an aide to the Port-au-Prince mayor confirmed the government would welcome the tents, Schrade said he called Barron Hilton -- the son of Hilton hotel founder Conrad Hilton -- for help in getting them from storage in Reno, Nevada, to Haiti. The Conrad Hilton Foundation, already involved in Haiti relief projects, agreed to finance the shipment, he said.

Edmonds said the outage hit ""a limited number of customers"" in the South, some of whom were without service since Monday. The service has roughly 7.4 million subscribers. In all, fewer than 1% of those customers experienced the outage, according to an earlier AT&T statement. The outage was related to a software upgrade, Edmonds said, saying the problem was fixed by AT&T engineers Thursday morning. The service outage did not affect AT&T's landline or wireless service subscribers. User reports on a discussion thread in the AT&T forums spread from Florida to parts of Texas. By Thursday, many of them were reporting that service had returned. Not that it prevented several from venting their frustration. ""I just got an AT&T ad in email that said how wonderful they are too,"" wrote one subscriber from Oklahoma. ""Come on already. My husband says we are canceling. There is no excuse for no service at all for 3 days, no explanation, and not even following through on the ones that you had appointments scheduled with ... . Bad, bad, bad business."" Edmonds said that affected customers will receive a credit on their bills. The credits will appear within 30 to 60 days, she said. U-verse is a ""triple play"" bundle of cable TV, phone and Internet services offered by AT&T. It was launched in 2006 and is available in 22 states.","AT&T says U-verse service back up for all after outage .

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 12:26 EST, 12 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:49 EST, 13 December 2012 . A couple furious with the work a builder has done on their home have posted a huge banner outside the house warning locals that he is a 'cowboy'. Fran Ikin and Peter Mortin paid Dean Watts more than £7,000 to transform their new semi into a dream home, but claim he wrecked the house with shoddy workmanship. The couple now say they want to stop others from being 'conned' by the builder, whom they accuse of 'ruining lives'. Fury: Fran Ikin outside her home in Gaywood, Norfolk which she claims was ruined by a 'cowboy builder' Ms Ikin and Mr Mortin, who recently became engaged, employed Watts to build a conservatory, extend their kitchen, fit a wood burner, knock through two rooms, fit a new bathroom, then plaster and paint the house in Gaywood, Norfolk. But they say he committed 25 different blunders which will cost them £12,000 to repair, and in protest they have written 'Dean Watts cowboy builder?' on a banner he left hanging on the scaffolding outside their home. The couple were furious with the builder's work - but they say that instead of offering to repair the damage, Watts demanded a £500 bonus before he would leave. They have remortgaged their home to pay for the repairs - less than a week after moving in. Chaos: Ms Ikin posing inside the home, which was supposed to have been renovated by Dean Watts . 'Shoddy': The couple claim Watts left much of the job undone despite being paid over £7,000 for his work . Mr Morton, 44, said: 'He has conned us out of a lot of hard-earned money. We have no money left and every day after work we spend trying to fix the house. 'It is bitterly cold, we have to flush the toilet with a bucket and we have no hot water to have a shower. It has been a complete nightmare. 'If the government are not going to protect us against cowboy builders then I will make sure everyone in the area knows what this man has done and ensure they never employ him. 'I want to stop him from ruining other people's lives.' Warning: The homeowners say they want to send a message to their neighbours in the wake of their ordeal . The homeowner met Watts in the builder's antique furniture shop, which is near Ms Ikin's pottery workshop in Hunstanton, Norfolk. He hired him for £7,800 after Watts claimed to have 20 years' experience, and the builder began working alongside a colleague in late October. However, the couple became suspicious when he asked for an extra £4,000 to treat the roof for woodworm, and they started keeping a diary detailing his work. They say they found him using bathroom sealant around the fireplace and knocking down a supporting wall leaving a hole in the roof. They later discovered he was apparently entirely untrained after he told the homeowners he had swept the chimney ready to install a log-burning stove. A dangerous coating of soot nine inches deep was later found in the flue which could have started a house fire. Uneven: The couple claim that Watts left the house in a nearly uninhabitable state last month . Mr Morton and Ms Ikin also discovered holes in the ceiling of the bedroom and bathroom, and accuse Watts of installing a cheap Chinese wood burner rather than the reliable model he had promised. Despite having no heating, hot water or drainage, and the roof leaking when it rains, the couple have had no choice but to move into the house, as the lease on the rental property where they had been living expired. They say they must now pay for digging up the concrete for the conservatory, replacing the wood burner and fixing the roof. Ms Ikin, 47, claims she was tricked into paying Watts an extra £3,500 when her fiancé, who had already paid the builder, was away on holiday. Watts failed to reply to messages asking him to comment on the couple's allegations.","Fran Ikin and Peter Mortin paid builder £7,000 to craft their dream home .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . An iPhone case has been developed with a built-in breathalyser. Users breathe into a test hole in the case and readings pop up on a display seconds later. Hiroyasu Yamamitsu, boss of Japanese firm Thanko which created the device, said: ‘After drinking  alcohol it’s difficult to know whether people can drive a car or not. ‘People need to check if they’re safe to drive and there’s nothing more convenient than having one built in to your phone’s case.’ However, the case should not be used as a standalone device to determine a safe driving limit, the firm warned. To get a blood alcohol reading from the Japanese Alcohol Checker case, pictured, users blow onto the test hole on the back of the case for up to five seconds. After 20 seconds, the reading, measured in grams per litre appears on a small display, shown as a percentage . The display will also light up red, pictured left, or green, pictured right, to warn people if they're over the driving limit, or it is safe to get in the car.

"Paris Hilton has become the target of anti-Semitic taunts and death threats from a crazed stalker who seems to believe the hotel heiress and her family are Jewish. The 33-year-old - who was raised a Roman Catholic - and her father Rick Hilton have both been targeted on Instagram and Facebook by a man who has posted several abusive messages to the pair. According to TMZ, one of the posts he allegedly wrote read: 'I know ur Jew family gives nothing,' and another stated: 'KILL JEWS FOR FUN (sic)' Paris Hilton (left) - who was raised a Roman Catholic - and her father Rick Hilton (right) have both been targeted by a guy on Instagram and Facebook who has posted several abusive messages to the pair . A post to Rick said: 'one month and she's dead, she's never coming home. (sic)' Another message to Rick read: 'I'll beat u and that bitch to unconscious.(sic)' The man is also alleged to have threatened to sexually assault the 33-year-old star. The Los Angeles Police Department has obtained a warrant to try to track down the man on the social media sites and believe they know who he is. This is not the first time Paris has been hit with death threats. In May 2007, the hotel heiress was sentenced to a 45-day jail term and before the stretch was due to start in June that year she was said to be inundated with threats from inmates. An insider said at the time: 'These maniacs have been writing, ""We're going to get you,"" and, ""I'm going to kill you."" It's horrifying. 'One person wrote that she's going to steal Paris' shoes when she gets to jail--and if Paris argues, she'll be beaten to a pulp.'

"An engineer who was told by colleagues that he was 'wasting his time' designing the world's first video games console in 1972 has died aged 92. Ralph Baer, who died this week at his home in Manchester, New Hampshire, first considered the possibility of a video games console while working as a television engineer in the 1950s. Over the next ten years, as chief designer for Sanders Associates - which is now part of defence contractor BAE Systems - he started working on his idea. He had his break-through in 1966 while waiting at a bus stop in New York, after which he wrote down a four-page proposal, which he developed into the world's first video games console. Ralph Baer, pictured, invented the world's first video games console in 1972, called the Magnavox Odyssey . His initial design was a simple Brown Box, pictured, with controlled a Table Tennis game on the screen . One eBay seller has offered their Magnavox Odyssey for sale including original box for $20,000 . His Brown Box, which was licensed by Magnavox in the 1970s, was the forerunner for the Magnavox Odyssey, which is acknowledged as the world's first video games console. His invention predated the Atari, and he had a developed a table-tennis game, before the rival system launched their world famous Pong. Mr Baer was born in Germany to a Jewish family and was fortunate enough to leave the country in 1938 to the United States, avoiding the Holocaust. The Magnavox Odyssey was launched in 1972 and was able to play around two dozen games. The games system plugged into the back of the television set featured hand-held controllers which allowed players to direct action on the screen. The company failed to develop a major video games division, but made substantial money from suing companies such as Atari and Nintendo for infringing upon Mr Baer's patents. The Magnavox Odyssey sold 330,000 units between 1972 and 1974. His son, Mark Baer, recalled playing early versions of video games on a small black and white TV perched on a shoe stand. Mr Baer received the National Medal of Technology from President George W. Bush in 2006 and was inducted into the U.S. National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2010. Mr Baer, pictured, was told by his colleagues that he was 'wasting his time' working on a video game machine . Before inventing the system that became known as the Magnavox Odyssey, Baer said he often was asked by co-workers how the group would make any money from the project. He said in an interview in 2010: 'People thought I was wasting my time and the company's money for that matter. A 1972 Magnavox Odyssey, with all the various attachments, stickers and controllers has been offered for sale on eBay. According to the Califonian seller, the console comes in 'as new' condition. The box has been opened, although there are no signs of ageing or damage. 'There's no way anybody could have predicted how fast this industry would take off.' A version of The Brown Box is now at the American History Museum at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. The Smithsonian plans to open a gallery next year with a focus on innovation and is including Mr Baer's workshop. Mr Baer later formed his own consulting business, through which he created or assisted in developing numerous electronic toys and games. In Simon, still in production today, the player has to duplicate an increasingly complicated pattern of lights and sounds. Mark Baer said his father had patients for more than 150 inventions, including a light gun an dtalking cards. He said; 'He had all kinds of ideas. We stepped on the doormat that would talk back to you. He had a great sense of humor. He'd program it, like you can say anything you want, ""Welcome to my home,"" or ""Hey, go away!""' Mark Baer said his father was working on new ideas up until recently. Ralph Baer: 'If you have it in your genes, it's almost like breathing,' he said.","Ralph Baer 'invented' the games console while waiting for a bus in 1966 .

"Vermont's governor on Thursday signed a bill into law that will require the labeling of genetically modified foods -- hailing it as the first such law in the nation. Under the new law, food offered for retail sale that is entirely or partially produced with genetic engineering must be labeled as such by July 2016. ""Vermonters take our food and how it is produced seriously, and we believe we have a right to know what's in the food we buy,"" said Gov. Peter Shumlin. ""More than 60 countries have already restricted or labeled these foods, and now one state -- Vermont -- will also ensure that we know what's in the food we buy and serve our families."" In the absence of federal action, other states have introduced similar legislation or ballot initiatives, according to the non-profit Center for Food Safety. Maine and Connecticut passed laws requiring labeling, but they won't go into effect until other states pass GMO-labeling laws. Vermont is the first to pass a ""no strings attached"" bill, the watchdog group said. Supporters of the law expect it will be challenged in court. ""I can make no predictions or promises about how the courts will ultimately rule but I can promise that my office will mount a vigorous and zealous defense of the law that has so much support from Vermont consumers,"" said Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell. The governor tweeted: ""Those opposed will put up a fight. Help us fight back."" Cathleen Enright, executive vice president for food and agriculture for the Biotechnology Industry Organization, a trade group, warned that mandated labeling could make food costs for the average household could go up as much as $400 a year. She stressed foods made from genetically modified crops are as safe as any other. ""And these same GM crops have enabled farmers to produce more on less land with fewer pesticide applications, less water and reduced on-farm fuel use,"" Enright said in a statement. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service approved a non-GMO label for meat and liquid egg products in June, the first time the department has approved such a label from a third party. GMO foods were approved for human consumption in 1995, but the Food and Drug Administration never required any labels pointing them out as such.","Food entirely or partially produced with genetic engineering must be labeled .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A stolen Statue of Liberty replica has resurfaced in a disturbing video posted on YouTube that shows someone decapitating the blindfolded lady and smashing her head into pieces. The YouTube video shows a gloved hand sawing off Lady Liberty's head before smashing it. The 200-pound replica was stolen less than a month ago from Vox Pop, a coffee shop in Brooklyn. ""It's very disturbing,"" shop operator Debi Ryan told CNN, adding the video struck a chord similar to that of terrorist assassination videos. ""I don't know what it means. ... I don't know who would do this."" The YouTube video begins with a waving American flag, and then shows a gloved hand sawing off the head of the statue before crushing it. The slogans ""We don't want your freedom"" and ""Death to America"" flash across the screen during the one-minute video, which is dated July Fourth. It was anonymously e-mailed to the Daily News and Ryan earlier this week. Ryan said she's sure the statue in the video is the one stolen from her cafe. ""She's unique. I know my girl,"" she said of the statue. ""We just had her completely refurbished, outfitted with a solar torch and painted."" Authorities told CNN they are handling the case as a larceny rather than separately investigating the YouTube video. ""We want to verify who sent the e-mail with the video and see if they're responsible,"" police said. A sign on the store, located in Ditmas Park, reads, ""Books, Coffee, Democracy,"" near where the 8-foot replica of Lady Liberty used to stand outside. The self-described community coffee shop is also a bookstore and a spot for artists and performers. ""We've created a space here that's owned by the community,"" Ryan said. ""We're all about freedom of speech and freedom to be who you are and say whatever you think."" But Ryan doesn't consider the YouTube video featuring her stolen statue appropriate free speech. ""Vox Pop stands for freedom of speech. You don't get to steal somebody else's property to send that message. We have to respect each other,"" she said. Although the coffee shop recently faced economic problems and neighborhood tension, the motive behind the statue's theft remains unknown. As for whether there will be a replacement statue, Ryan said, ""I'm hoping. I think she belongs here. But she added, ""Whether we have a physical statue or not, what she stands for remains here.""","Video shows Statue of Liberty replica blindfolded before it's decapitated, smashed .

Neighbour Zhou Bo went outside of his own property after hearing a commotion in the street in Lingwu, Ningxia, China. It was then he spotted the young boy dangling from a fourth-storey window with his head wedged between metal bars. Helping hand: Zhou Bo went to the aid of a young boy left dangling from a fourth-storey window after getting his head stuck in a grid in Lingwu, Ningxia, China . Dangerous: Zhou Bo managed to prevent the boy from suffocating by holding him up by his feet while also balancing on stool perched on a window sill . He said: 'I went there, and saw a boy dangling in the air, as his head was stuck in between the window grid.' Zhou could see that the boy was suffocating as his feet had nothing to stand on. He dashed inside and raced up to the flat but found the door locked. He then went one floor below but discovered that the gap between that window and the dangling boy was too great. Zhou said: 'Without help, the boy would be suffocated soon, or he has the danger of dropping down'. So Zhou found a chair and balanced it precariously on the third-storey window ledge before standing on it and supporting the trapped boy's feet from underneath. 'I felt time froze, and my arms went numb but firemen still didn't arrive,' said Zhou. Finally, firefighters arrived 40 minutes later and were able to break into the apartment and pull the boy, who had been left home alone, to safety. Waiting game: Zhou Bo had to hold the position for 40 minutes until firefighters arrived at the scene .

"(CNN) -- It's doubtful there's ever a perfect time or place to end a marriage, but for Dean McDermott, that time and place was in a Palm Springs, California, hotel room after playing a round of golf. Mary Jo Eustace said she's been able to take her 2006 divorce from Dean McDermott and turn it into a positive. The actor told his then-wife, Mary Jo Eustace, that he'd been having an affair with Tori Spelling and that he'd found his soul mate, Eustace recalled Tuesday on HLN's ""The Joy Behar Show."" ""[He said], 'I'm leaving you -- she loves me unconditionally,' "" Eustace said. Eustace replied that ""you've known her [for] three weeks. I actually thought it was a joke. I thought I was being punked. But it was true,"" she told Behar. Eustace offers life lessons she learned from the 2006 split with McDermott in her book ""Divorce Sucks: What to Do When Irreconcilable Differences, Lawyers Fees, and Your Ex Husband's Hollywood Wife Makes You Miserable,"" which arrived in bookstores Monday.  Watch Eustace describe her shock » . Donald Trump's ex-wife Marla Maples; Dina Matos, ex-wife of former New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey; and Lance Armstrong's ex, Kristen, also appeared on Behar's show to break down what happens during and after very public breakups. When Eustace found out her 13-year marriage was ending, she said she was ""in a really ugly bikini -- missing like padding on one side, holding my daughter in my arms,"" but at least the bomb wasn't dropped in front of news cameras. Matos was standing right next to her husband when he admitted at a press conference that he'd had an affair with another man. ""I was in shock because I had only learned three days before that he had been involved in a relationship,"" Matos recalled on Tuesday's show. ""I was there in the moment. I was there physically but mentally, you know; I was just trying to maintain my composure and not fall apart in front of the cameras."" When a marriage ends, ""you think this is the end of your life as you know it,"" Matos said. ""And in some ways it is. You feel powerless."" Especially once the media picks up on the crumbling matrimony. ""The first week that my divorce was announced ... I saw a picture of my ex-husband with his new wife's legs wrapped around his head,"" Eustace said. ""You're in complete survival mode."" Although Lance Armstrong's post-marriage flame, Sheryl Crow, wasn't the reason his five-year marriage to Kristen ended, she told Behar it was still difficult to watch. And yet the hardest part for Kristen Armstrong was disliking her former husband's new love. ""I really wanted to dislike her,"" Armstrong said. ""I really did. [But] she's beautiful. She's smart. She's funny. She was great with the kids. For as much as I wanted to dislike her and I tried, I couldn't."" Matos said it's different when your husband leaves for another man. ""When your husband leaves you for another woman, at some point you know there was love in the marriage, and you had something,"" she said on Tuesday's show. ""But when your husband is not the person that you think he is, you know, he's an impostor -- then you start questioning every aspect of your life together. What was real? Did he ever love me? Why did he marry me? Later I found out why,"" she said. After McGreevey announced his affair, Matos said she found papers that appeared to be the outline for a book that said McGreevey married her ""for political gain,"" she said.

"Toulouse, France (CNN) -- The disruptive days of thunderous, fuel-guzzling planes hovering in our skies could be a thing of the past. So too could the tortuous queues and endless boarding process, if futuristic flight concepts become reality. Since the first commercial passenger flight in 1914, 65 billion passengers have taken to the skies and another 65 billion are expected to do the same before 2030. And experts say efficient, greener performance is what will steer aviation into the next century. ""A major breakthrough in an airliner will bring half a percent, 1% greater fuel efficiency, which doesn't sound like much -- but to an airline, it's huge. It's millions of dollars (in savings) a year,"" said Robert van der Linden, chair and curator of air transportation at the Smithsonian Institution National Air and Space Museum. The Airbus A380 is the world's biggest passenger aircraft, and its future depends on constant redevelopment and improving performance. The energy problem is one of the major drivers for the company, Gregor Dirks, corporate innovator for Airbus, told CNN's Isa Soares. ""We have to do something about it. Reducing fuel burn is one way, and we have been very successful in the past."" The Airbus vision of the future can be seen through its concept plane design, which is packed with the stuff made of engineering dreams. One concept feature is dubbed ""eco-climb,"" where take off is assisted by propelled acceleration for a steeper climb, so that planes reach efficient cruise altitudes sooner. In the concept cabin, seats will use body heat to power aircraft systems such as holographic pop-up pods, while a futuristic cabin membrane can become transparent to give passengers open panoramic views. What's more, Airbus has radical ideas for speedier boarding. ""We could think about city center check-in and actually transport little pods to the airport where the passengers are already in and just slide the pod into the airplane,"" said Dirks. Some of the full-blown features of the Airbus concept plane will become a reality later this century, according to Dirks, but parts of the vision are already being implemented in the current fleet. Titanium brackets used in the cabin have been made using 3-D printing, reducing the weight of the parts, and allowing the manufacture of ""organic"" shapes that would otherwise be too expensive to produce. ""This is going to be a big revolution in manufacturing,"" predicted Dirks. ""Passengers won't see it much but they get more choice and they got it cheaper and earlier.""","Aviation's future must be efficient, greener and easier as air traffic grows .

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- A 69-year-old who was previously convicted of torching a palace has been arrested in connection with a fire that destroyed Namdaemun, South Korea's oldest wooden structure and a national treasure, authorities said on Tuesday. People on Monday look at the debris of the Namdaemun gate in central Seoul after the fire. Similarities between the Sunday night fire and the 2006 blaze led to the investigation of a man identified only as Mr. Chae, said Kim Young-Su, chief of police of the Namdaemun police station. Chae had served time in prison for the palace fire. Police searched the home of Chae's ex-wife and found a can of paint thinner and a pair of leather gloves they believe were used in the fire, Kim said. Chae confessed to starting the fire, saying he was upset by a land grievance that led him to start the 2006 fire and by the sentence he was handed in that case, Kim said. Chae was free on a suspended sentence, Kim added. Chae said he chose Namdaemun because it was easily accessible by public transportation and yet situated in a lightly populated area where the fire was unlikely to hurt people, according to police. The fire burned for hours, and more than a hundred firefighters tried to save it.  Watch the reaction to the Namdaemun's destruction » .

"A Jack Russell faces being put to sleep after its tongue was ripped out by a hawk. Four-year-old Ollie was enjoying a walk with owner Ian Farquhar when the Harris hawk - which was being trained nearby - swooped and attacked him. The crazed bird of prey sank its talons into the dog before ripping off his tongue leaving the pooch 'screaming and covered in blood'. Poorly pooch: Four-year-old Ollie was enjoying a walk with owner Ian Farquhar when a Harris hawk swooped and attacked him . Mr Farquhar, 47, from Dundee, now faces . the heartbreaking decision of whether to have Ollie put to sleep after . being told by vets that he will have to be hand-fed for the rest of his . life. Mr Farquhar, a gardener, said: 'We were enjoying a nice walk on a lovely morning, Ollie was by my side and my other dog Rocky, was about 10 yards ahead of us. 'It all happened quite fast. I heard a scuffle and looked down and there was something big and brown attacking Ollie. 'I thought it was another dog at first, like a Staffordshire Bull Terrier and tried to kick it but it wouldn’t let go. Terrible decision: Mr Farquhar, 47, now faces the heartbreaking decision of whether to have Ollie put to sleep after being told by vets that he will have to be hand-fed for the rest of his life . 'Then I saw the wings and realised it . was a bird of prey. Ollie was howling and he was covered in blood. I . started crying and my clothes and my hands were covered in blood. 'I’m absolutely devastated.' Mr Farquhar said his sadness soon turned to anger when he realised the hawk was not wild but being trained by a man further up the path. He said: 'The hawk’s owner ran over and got the bird off Ollie, his tongue was in his hand. 'He had a go at me for kicking the bird. I couldn’t believe it. The path is popular with dog owners, he shouldn’t have been there. 'The owner said he would pay for the vets bills, but its not about the money, it’s about Ollie. If another dog had attacked Ollie, it would be almost certainly put down. So I want the hawk destroyed in case it attacks some other innocent animal.' Crazed: Mr Farquhar said his sadness soon turned to anger when he realised the Harris hawk was not wild but being trained by a man further up the path (file picture) Mr Farquhar and Ollie were taken to . Parkside Veterinary Practice in Dundee by the bird’s owner, Colin Kirk. Ollie has been in the care of vets since the attack on Friday morning. But unless Ollie learns to swallow his food without the use of his tongue, he will have to be hand fed meaning his quality of life will be poor. Mr Farquhar said: 'The vets have basically said he will never be the same again. He had to have a lump in his mouth sewed down and half of his tonsils were taken out. 'His quality of life is going to be low, but we’ll just have to see how he gets on. He might not even be able to drink on his own so I might have to bottle feed him. 'The attack has destroyed my life, Ollie’s and Rocky’s. The two dogs were best of friends and you can tell Rocky is missing him.' Dundee council worker Colin Kirk said the attack was an ‘unfortunate accident’ and said that he would respect any request to have the one-year-old hawk put down. 'I let her loose and she left her perch in a tree and flew over to his direction. She went on to the dog and I managed to get her off and separated them. 'It was quite a nasty injury, this chap was understandably jumping up and down. I explained that the bird was insured and he didn’t have to worry, and that the vet care will be dealt with. 'She has never attacked a dog or anyone I have been out with before. Maybe she caught a flash in the long grass and thought it was a rabbit.' He added: 'If he wants the bird destroyed it’s up to him.'","Harris hawk was being trained near a path popular with dog walkers .

And this is precisely what has happened, as the show's bosses pull out all the stops, and their cheque books, to keep the stars from leaving. Downton Abbey stars, including  Dame Maggie Smith and Hugh Bonneville, have secured bumper pay rises to appear in the fourth series of the show as work offers come thick and fast in the wake of the ITV show's global success. For some, earnings have doubled since the first series in 2010. High rollers: For some of the Downton stars,  earnings have doubled since the first series in 2010. Reason to be cheerful: Downton Abbey bosses are only too aware that Hollywood is a major draw for the show's stars, like Dame Maggie Smith (pictured), so are offering more money to keep them . The bright lights of Hollywood have already proven too much of a temptation for actor Jessica Brown Findlay, who played Lady Sybil.

"(CNN) -- According to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, prescription drug overdose deaths in Florida are up a staggering 265% since 2003. But it's not just the deaths that have Florida officials worried; it's the births. ""We saw the number of crack babies that died, and this is just another version of that,"" Broward County Sheriff Al Lamberti said. ""We all need to be concerned."" According to state health records, nearly 1,400 Florida babies were born suffering from drug withdrawal syndrome in 2010, a fourfold increase since 2003. The state does not track the specific drug the babies are hooked on, but south Florida doctors and neonatal nurses believe the increase is due to a sharp increase in pregnant women addicted to prescription drugs. ""They go through withdrawal symptoms,"" said Mary Osuch, the head nurse at Broward General Medical Center's neonatal intensive care unit. ""They're crampy, miserable. They sweat. They can have rapid breathing. Sometimes, they can even have seizures."" According to the White House Office on Drug Control Policy, prescription drug abuse is the nation's fastest-growing drug problem. Marsha Currant, who runs the Susan B. Anthony Recovery Center near Fort Lauderdale, says prescription drug addiction overtook crack in 2009 as the main problem afflicting the pregnant women who are treated there. ""In the very beginning, it was really 100% crack cocaine,"" said Currant, who started keeping track of drug trends in 1995. ""We see a lot more prescription drugs now."" Currant says new mothers who are hooked on prescription drugs are often reluctant to seek help for fear the authorities will take their babies from them. ""We wanted to have a place where women didn't have to chose between getting treatment and having their children go into foster care,"" she said. Compounding the problem, women who are addicted to prescription drugs and find themselves pregnant cannot safely go off the drugs without medical supervision. They need to be weaned off slowly, or the baby will go into withdrawal in the womb. At the Susan B. Anthony Center, one mother who became hooked on prescription drugs after her husband died says she felt her baby suffering while she was getting clean. ""I know that I'm going through stuff getting off the pills. So what's she going through? She can't talk. She's just a baby,"" Jessica said. Thanks to the center, Jessica was weaned off oxycodone before her baby, Casey, was born. But she fears the long-term effects of her drug abuse on her daughter, who has been suffering from respiratory problems. ""I want to make sure that she doesn't hurt anymore,"" Jessica said. ""She doesn't deserve that, because she's a princess."" Jessica graduated from the center's recovery program last week.","Hundreds of Florida babies have been born addicted to drugs .

After Jenny, who goes by the Reddit name Judokitten, posted the letter on Monday it got nearly 6,000 points and thousands of comments in response. 'My dad found my passive aggressive note that I wrote to the Tooth Fairy,' Jenny wrote with the snapshot of the letter she wrote back in 1991. The author: Jenny, 32, discovered the letter at her family's home over the weekend and posted to Reddit on Monday not expecting to get the overwhelming response she did . 'It was better than I remember.' Jenny told Yahoo Parenting that she recalls writing the letter at a time when she was starting to, 'figure out the truth' about things like the Tooth Fairy and Santa .

'So when I lost this tooth, I didn’t tell anyone for two days because I wanted to see if she would come,' said Jenny. Jenny told her mother about her anger towards the Tooth Fairy and her mother suggested she write a letter to the Tooth Fairy telling her how she felt. '(Not very) Dear T.

From now on I’m keeping my own teeth. Unsincerely, Jennifer E. PS Keep collecting from Mike, though. Obviously you like him better. P.P.S. Don’t bother to write back,' said the letter.

Maybe if you clean your room, I could get to you in a timely manner,' said the note in response which arrived the next day. Jenny thought of the letter when she went to visit her parents over the weekend. After Jenny brought up the letter to her father he was able to pull it out from a notebook minutes later. 'My mom keeps all of my adorable things —like my kindergarten graduation cape — and my dad keeps all the snarky things, so it made sense that he would have it,' said Jenny. Jenny said that her mother's response to her Tooth Fairy letter let her in on the secret that the tooth fairy wans’t real. 'Her response was a quiet acknowledgement between us that my mom and I both knew the truth,' Jenny said. 'Mike, my brother – well, I won’t reveal how long he believed. But let’s just say for his last tooth, the Tooth Fairy gave him gas money.' Jenny who has a seven-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter hasn’t had to deal with her children doubting the Tooth Fairy's existence yet but she has been late on a few tooth payments. 'I’ve forgotten to leave money before and had to come up with excuses for why the Tooth Fairy was late, though none were as good as my mom’s,' she told Yahoo. 'Recently I used, ""you lost the tooth really late in the afternoon so the fairy already got her list for the day. She’ll catch up with you tomorrow.""

"By . Amanda Williams . Some popular antidepressants could double the risk of a child being born with a heart defect if an expectant mother takes them in early pregnancy, an expert has warned. Professor Stephen Pilling,  of drug rationing body National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), believes the risk is such that they are not worth taking for women with mild to moderate depression. Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, have been used in up to one in six women of child bearing age. Some popular antidepressants could double the risk of a child being born with a heart defect if an expectant mother takes them in early pregnancy, an expert has warned .

The risk of a baby being born with a heart defect is around two in 100. Evidence suggests if a mother took an SSRI in early pregnancy the risk increases to around four in 100 . The Panorama programme has spoken to eight mothers who had babies born with serious heart defects. All of them had taken a commonly used SSR antidepressant while pregnant. While prescription guidelines only warn specifically against giving women the SSRI, paroxetine, in early pregnancy,  Professor Pilling, has said that advice is about to be updated, as available evidence 'suggests there is a risk'. He said: 'We make a quite a lot of effort really to discourage women from smoking or drinking even small amounts of alcohol in pregnancy, and yet we're perhaps not yet saying the same about antidepressant medication, which is going to be carrying similar - if not greater - risks.' He said Nice guidance will be revised to take into account that the group of antidepressants are 'linked to heart defects.' He added that women not suffering from the most severe depression who become pregnant whilst taking the drug are taking an 'unnecessary risk'. Lundbeck, the manufacturer of one of the SSRIs, Citalopram, told the BBC a recent review of scientific literature concluded the drug 'does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of major foetal malformations'. They warned not prescribing the drug to a depressed woman could generate greater risks to her and her baby that the medication itself.","SSRIs antidepressants are used in up to 1 in 6 women of child-bearing age .

"(CNN) -- The former head of an Air Force sexual assault prevention program was acquitted Wednesday of an assault charge stemming from an incident in Arlington, Virginia, last spring, his lawyer confirmed to CNN. Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, 42, was arrested in May and accused of grabbing a woman's buttocks and breasts in a parking lot in Arlington County, not far from the Pentagon. A police report said the unidentified woman fought off her assailant, who appeared intoxicated. Krusinski was initially charged with sexual battery, but prosecutors later changed that charge to assault and battery, according to CNN affiliate WJLA. ""We are very gratified by the verdict and gratified by the very serious consideration the jury gave to this matter,"" defense attorney Barry Coburn told CNN. ""The system worked, which is always a good thing to see."" Krusinski, a 1994 graduate of the Air Force Academy who served tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan, was the chief of a branch of the Air Force's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program at the time of the incident. He was removed from that post after his arrest, which came two days before the Pentagon released a report showing a 6% year-over-year increase in the number of reported sexual assault cases within the military in the fiscal year that ended September 30, 2012. Coburn said it was unclear what the acquittal would mean for Krusinski's Air Force career.

"When Microsoft introduced a preview version of a fresh and inventive webmail service it called Outlook.com last August, it was pretty clear that it was telling the world that it intended to start winding down its venerable Hotmail sooner or later. Now it's official. The company is announcing that Outlook.com is coming out of preview mode and is now officially available worldwide. And so it's going to start moving more than 300 million Hotmail users over. They'll be able to keep their Hotmail.com e-mail addresses — or Live.com or MSN.com, if that's what they've got — but the Hotmail service and brand will be going away. The transition will be gradual: At first, the Hotmail faithful will get e-mails and other alerts telling them about the switchover. They'll be able to make the jump immediately, or postpone it. But by the end of the summer, the company intends to have moved all Hotmail users over to Outlook.com. For most of those people, that should be a good thing — or at least, as forced transitions go, not a bad thing. While it's impossible to underestimate the ferocity with which some folks prefer to clutch onto whatever they've already got, Outlook.com is a far better service than Hotmail, with a radically decluttered interface and useful new organization tools. (I also like its interface — which is a variant of the Windows 8 look formerly known as Metro — better than Gmail's.) Yet it's also recognizable as having a family connection to Hotmail, reducing the chances that anyone will be bewildered by it or will lose a favorite feature once the switchover is complete. At the moment, Microsoft says, Outlook.com has 60 million active members, a third of which are Gmail users. (Presumably some of those are true defectors from Gmail, while others use both Gmail and Outlook.com.) Once the Hotmail transition is complete, Outlook.com will have hundreds of millions of users, giving it the same sort of massive scale as Gmail (425 million users as of June 2012) and Yahoo Mail (281 million users as of December 2012). And Microsoft seems to be serious about winning over lots more users from Gmail and other services: It's planning to advertise Outlook.com heavily in all sorts of media. The company has posted a couple of splashy TV spots — both of which, unlike the current Scroogled campaign, are devoted to making people feel good about Outlook.com rather than bad about Gmail. While I'm favorably impressed by Outlook.com, I'm not considering dumping Gmail myself anytime soon; Google's service remains a much richer platform, with additional useful features, mobile apps and support from third-party apps and services. Microsoft says to expect more Outlook.com features now that the service is out of preview mode, including Skype video calls and a calendar, both of which the company first promised when it announced the service last year. I'll be keeping an eye on it — an Outlook.com which retained its sleek look and competed with Gmail in depth and breadth of capabilities could be spectacular. Even Gmail users who have no intention of leaving the service should be happy that Outlook.com exists. Just as Microsoft's Bing gives Google's search engine its only serious competition, Outlook.com is poised to be Gmail's most imposing rival. I'm still getting used to the notion of Microsoft, of all companies, being a plucky underdog — but I'm glad it's giving Google at least two incentives to avoid resting on its laurels.","Microsoft says its Outlook.com e-mail service is now officially available worldwide .

Sentenced: Carer Angela Perkins was jailed for two years after admitting stealing £100,000 from a 90-year-old dementia sufferer . A carer who stole £100,000 from a 90-year-old dementia patient has been jailed for two years. Angela Perkins siphoned money from the vulnerable patient's life savings between 2005 and 2010. Perkins, from Norwich, in Norfolk, helped patients to do their shopping and had access to the woman's PIN and bank accounts. She had originally been charged with stealing £55,000 from the woman in July last year, but it was later discovered that she had stolen almost double that amount. The 47-year-old was handed a two year prison sentence at Norwich Crown Court after admitting the theft at a previous hearing. The victim is in 24-hour residential care. Det Con Huw Caine, of Norfolk Police, said after the sentencing: 'The actions of Perkins left the victim confused, upset and extremely traumatised with worry due to the fact her savings had dwindled away and she didn't have any money left in her account. 'Perkins exploited the fact the victim was vulnerable and removed money from the victim's account for her own use, abusing her position of trust. 'When Perkins was challenged in interview about accounting for cash withdrawals from the victim's account that corresponded with deposits into her own account she was unable to give any satisfactory answers.' He added: 'The case highlights that offences of this nature and the targeting of some of our most vulnerable people in society will not be tolerated. 'I hope that the results of this case highlight to other potential offenders how robustly Norfolk Constabulary will investigate and deal with such incidents.' Norfolk Police said it was now trying to confiscate money from Perkins under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Should a confiscation order be served and Perkins fail to pay up, she could face an additional sentence.

"Totteham manager Mauricio Pochettino has urged supporters to stop booing Emmanuel Adebayor ahead of Saturday’s clash against Arsenal. The Togolese striker came close to leaving White Hart Lane on transfer deadline day but saw a loan move to West Ham thwarted by chairman Daniel Levy, while the forward rejected moves to Queens Park Rangers and Crystal Palace. Adebayor has been targeted by supporters in recent weeks following comments made by the former Arsenal striker criticising Spurs fans. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino says fans must stop booing Emmanuel Adebayor . The Togo striker came close to leaving White Hart Lane on transfer deadline day . But Pochettino insists it is time for supporters to move on and get behind Adebayor – who holds the record for most goals scored in North London Derby’s, with eight goals. ‘Would I like the fans to stop booing Ade? Yes, yes, yes,’ said the Argentine. ‘It’s important that the fans forget the past. And I think he explained why he made the comments. ‘And now, all together, we need to try to get the success. Because we are in a key moment. We need to put out the bad things, the bad energy, we need to try to help each other and try to get the success. ‘He is a long way towards recovering his confidence and his levels - and that is our job: to try to push him and help him and get him in the best condition to improve quickly.’ Pochettino insists it is time for fans to get behind their forward ahead of the game against Arsenal . Meanwhile, Southampton boss Ronald Koeman has responded light-heartedly to claims from former Saints manager Pochettino that he inherited a ‘winning team’ when he took over at St Mary’s in the summer. Speaking to Catalan radio, Pochettino said: ‘You have to say that they invested close to 80million euros (£59.8million) in the summer and it was already a winning team on the up. ‘When we arrived at Southampton in January of 2013 they had the team that had conceded the most goals in the league. It was a team with a lot of problems, with players like Adam Lallana who wasn’t playing and Luke Shaw who wasn’t playing but in one and a half years we turned it round.’ But Koemansaid: ‘He is free to give his opinions, I’m happy in Southampton and thank you Mauricio; I have an easy job!’","Mauricio Pochettino urges Tottenham fans to stop booing Emmanuel Adebayor .

No-nonsense approach: Jo Frost has been criticised for her views on when a child should be moved from a cot to a bed . She can rein in the unruliest of toddlers, tame ugly  tantrums, and – seemingly without effort – has calmed many a nightmarish household overrun by naughty children. But, as Supernanny Jo Frost has discovered, woe betide anyone who comes between mothers’ groups and their views on certain parenting milestones. The TV nanny has found herself embroiled in a row after dispensing ‘irresponsible’ and ‘dangerous’ advice on when is best to move one’s toddler from a cot to a full-sized bed. Miss Frost, whose no-nonsense approach to child-rearing has earned her many fans as well as plenty of detractors, gave the advice in her latest book, saying mothers should wait for as long as possible before making the switchover. In the book, Jo Frost’s Toddler SOS, the 41-year-old is asked by a parent: ‘At what age do you generally move toddlers from a cot to a bed? It sounds like a stupid question but I have no idea.’ Miss Frost replies: ‘I see no rush unless she’s grown out of it and the cot has become too narrow a space to sleep in. If she’s sleeping well it’s definitely not worth disrupting her.’ The advice has provoked a backlash on parenting forums, including Netmums, with dozens of mothers saying they were shocked and surprised. One wrote: ‘There is more risk of your child hurting themselves falling whilst clambering over the bars of a cot than there is getting in and out of a toddler bed.’ Another added: ‘I’m shocked that she [Jo Frost] would think it ok to allow a child to climb out of a cot. My eldest did it at 17 months and fell head first, she could have had a nasty injury.’ Controversy: Miss Frost, a profsesional nanny, made her debut in 2004 on the Channel 4's Supernanny . ‘This is one time when you need to ignore Jo Frost and trust your own instincts,’ another posted. Miss Frost, a professional nanny, made her debut in 2004 on Channel 4’s Supernanny, a reality show in which she is called in to family homes and assists parents who are struggling with their children’s behaviour. Some of her methods have provoked debate in the past, such as banishing unruly children to a ‘naughty step’ – with some experts claiming this could cause emotional damage – or ‘coaching’ them to fall asleep by leaving them to cry. Clare Byam-Cook, a former midwife and celebrity anti-natal coach, yesterday expressed surprise over the star’s latest piece of advice. She said the general consensus is that children are moved at around the age of two because this is when they run the risk of climbing out of a cot and risking injury. Mrs Byam-Cook, whose clients have included Helena Bonham Carter and Kate Winslet, added: ‘I am amazed she should say that because the point is once a child can start climbing out of a cot you risk them climbing out and falling.’ Delaying the move too long can cause other problems, she added. ‘Most people have two-year gap between children and the last thing you want is to have a new baby needing to transition from Moses basket into a cot and have the cot still occupied by a toddler,’ said Mrs Byam-Cook. ‘Then if you try and move the toddler out of the cot you’re going to have an unhappy toddler who thinks that he is being moved into his own bed for your convenience rather than because he’s become a grown up.’ Miss Frost based her argument on the belief that moving a child from his or her cot too early could prompt juvenile sleep problems. ‘I’m a huge admirer of hers,’ Mrs Byam-Cook said, but added: ‘Of course, Jo meets children of all ages in her problem solving but perhaps something like safety of babies doesn’t register highly in her experience.’","Jo Frost said children should stay in a cot until they outgrow it in new book .

"(CNN) -- English Premier League grounds are noted for their passionate atmosphere and fans sometimes overstep the boundaries of public decency. In the task of adjudicating just what is and isn't acceptable to say at a football game, leading English Premier League club Liverpool has issued a list of banned words to its employees in its efforts to rid football of discriminatory behavior. The list of offensive words relates to race and religion, sexual orientation, gender and disability and was circulated to members of Liverpool's staff as part of a longer presentation, one page of which was leaked on the internet. ""The club wishes to eradicate any form of discrimination or discriminatory behavior both on and off the football pitch,"" reads the leaked document, which Liverpool confirmed was accurate. ""It's important to understand the context of what's being said, but here are examples of words worth listening out for which are usually offensive and the club consider unacceptable."" The list included terms such as ""n****r"", ""queen"", ""don't be a woman,"" ""cripple"" as well as ""princess""and ""man up"". ""The list -- which is accurate -- was part of a larger, private education program that is designed to teach our employees to recognize any and all forms of discrimination on the grounds, on and off the pitch,"" a Liverpool spokesman told CNN. ""As it was part of a private presentation, LFC cannot pass you on a copy."" The guidelines have has not been reportedly issued to Liverpool players because they receive separate instructions from the Football Association. The document prompted much discussion on social networking site Twitter with Guardian journalist Barney Ronay writing: ""Catching up with this Liverpool story. I see ""lady-boy"" appears under both Gender and Sexual Orientation but ""she-man"" is only under Gender. Typical anti-she man bias."" English football has been blighted by a series of racism scandals in recent years. Liverpool striker Luis Suarez was banned for eight matches and fined £40,000 in 2011 after being found guilty of racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra. The club was heavily criticized for its defense of Suarez, with the team and then manager Kenny Dalglish wearing t-shirts in support of the Uruguayan before a Premier League match against Wigan Athletic. In September 2012 former England captain John Terry was banned for four matches and fined £220,000 for a racist slur aimed at Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand. Terry also faced a criminal trial over the allegations, after which he was found not guilty. Meanwhile, English anti-racism organization Kick It Out, which this year marks 20 years of battling discrimination, has launched a smart phone app which allows fans to report incidents of racism at matches. ""It gives football fans the opportunity to report a racist incident if someone is causing a nuisance in their vicinity or trying to spoil their entertainment,"" former England and Tottenham Hotspur winger and Kick It Out trustee Garth Crooks told CNN. ""For the first time, certainly as long as I've been in football, a football fan can actually complain anonymously about someone being a racial nuisance. ""Now we're not saying that person is a racist, but they're using racist language and it deserves to be reported. The app allows you to do that. It's the perfect tool."" Crooks also hailed the work done by Kick It Out over the last two decades. ""I think it's been very successful,"" he added. ""We've moved from the days where abuse was common place in football and it was embarrassing for all concerned, to a place where the fans have pretty much taken control of the situation. ""They are much more determined to not be sitting in a controlled environment listening to their heroes being abused. ""We have CCTV monitoring areas of the football grounds to make sure that people behave. Managers and players are also involved to try and ensure that, when people play football, it's a comfortable working environment.""","Liverpool issue a list of banned discriminatory terms to employees .

"(CNN) -- Violence rocked two major Iraqi cities Wednesday, including Baghdad, where a car bombing near a wedding party and two other bombings killed at least 20 people, police said. In Mosul, a Sunni activist known to demonstrate against Iraq's Shiite-led government was assassinated, one of 10 people killed or found dead from acts of violence Wednesday in the northern Iraqi city, Mosul police officials said. The slayings come amid an uptick of political and sectarian violence across Iraq, where more than 350 people died in acts of violence in May, according to a CNN tally. And Wednesday's attacks come on what is becoming an especially deadly week in the country -- at least 110 people have been killed since Monday. In Baghdad, two car bombs and a roadside bomb exploded in separate Sunni neighborhoods in Baghdad within 30 minutes of each other Wednesday evening, police in the Iraqi capital said. One of the car bombs detonated near a wedding party in al-Diwan, a neighborhood in southwestern Baghdad, killing at least 16 people and wounding 42 others, according to police. It wasn't clear whether the wedding party involved Sunnis or Shiites. The other car bomb exploded in a market in the al-Gazaliya neighborhood in western Baghdad, killing four people and wounding 17 others, police said. And in the al-Khadraa neighborhood in western Baghdad, a roadside bomb wounded six people, police said. Meanwhile, Wednesday's killings in Mosul -- about 430 kilometers (265 miles) north of Baghdad -- were another sign of a shaky security situation in Nineveh, the province where Mosul is located and one of three Iraqi provinces that postponed April's provincial council elections until July because of violence. Gunmen fatally shot Sunni activist Sheikh Hassan al-Jabouri with pistols equipped with silencers in central Mosul, a predominantly Sunni city, police said. No suspects have been announced. Al-Jabouri was active in demonstrations demanding that the Shiite-led government stop what protesters call second-class treatment of Iraq's Sunni community. Since December, tens of thousands of such demonstrators have taken to the streets across Iraq. Sunni Arabs had more political clout in Iraq during Saddam Hussein's rule, until his government was deposed in 2003 after the U.S.-led invasion. Under the Shiite-led government in the post-Saddam era, Sunnis have felt marginalized. About two-thirds of Iraq's nearly 32 million people are Shiite and roughly a third are Sunni, according to the CIA World Factbook. Also Wednesday, a suicide attacker detonated a car bomb at a police station in southern Mosul, killing two people and wounding seven others, police said. And the bodies of three people who appeared to have been tortured and hanged were recovered from the Tigris River and sent to the Mosul morgue, police said. The hanging victims appeared to have died Wednesday morning, police said. They have not been identified. Also, Iraqi federal police killed four people in clashes with unspecified gunmen in eastern Mosul, police officials in the city said. The clashes happened after people reported suspicious activity in a building. When police arrived, gunmen emerged and attacked them, the Mosul police officials said. In other violence Wednesday, mortar rounds landed on offices of the Nineveh provincial council in central Mosul, wounding six people, according to police. Wednesday's bloodshed comes amid an increase of violence across Iraq, much of it stemming from discord between Sunni and Shiite Muslims. On Tuesday, at least 23 people were killed and more than 80 others were wounded in three explosions and three shooting incidents in Baghdad and Mosul, police officials said. On Monday, at least 57 people were killed and 190 wounded in a wave of attacks in Baghdad and other cities, police said. READ MORE: Iraq at crossroads as bombs explode .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 01:00 EST, 26 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:00 EST, 26 August 2013 . Eleven women are suing a Washington state police department over claims that they were inappropriately filmed as they undressed and used a jail cell toilet. Seattle attorney James Egan, who has filed the lawsuit against Puyallup police department, on behalf on the eleven women and one man, said: 'This is pervy, a peepshop ... there is no excuse.' His clients claim that when they were booked for DUI, which normally does not require changing into jail clothes, they were directed to change in a jail cell that had a wall-mounted security camera. Caught on camera: A woman is filmed getting undressed in a police cell . Mr Egan first noticed the practice two years ago, while working on a case for two women arrested for DUI, who were told to strip even though they were about to be booked, according to King 5 News. Concerned by what he saw, he made a public request for more jail footage to see if a pattern emerged. 'It appeared from my limited review that it was happening to women - attractive women, in particular,' he told King 5. One of the alleged victims, who has asked not to be identified, said: 'I thought it was maybe for seeing if we have contraband or something but we are already patted down. So then, why would there be a camera still?' In another case, a jailer allegedly . asked one of the women who had changed into the jail uniform to go back . into the cell and remove her underwear, saying it was jail protocol, Mr . Egan told the News Tribune. 'What possible security reason could they have … she’s going to hang . herself with her panties?' he said, adding that she was due to be released. However, Captain Scott Engle, of Puyallup Police Department, said it was a needed protocol to protect officers and inmates. 'No excuse': Attorney James Egan claims filming in cells is like 'a peep show' 'People who come into the corrections environment commonly hide narcotics, contraband, weapons or other miscellaneous things on their body or in their clothing,' he said. A spokesman for Puyallup told King 5 News video surveillance was standard in holding cells, as was stripping and changing into jail clothes. They added there was no evidence of exploitation by the police. 'We see no wrongdoing on the part of anyone at the jail,' Captain Engle said. Many of the alleged victims had no idea they had been filmed until they were contacted by Mr Egan. One recalled feeling sick as she watched the footage for the first time, adding: 'I [didn't] believe my own eye. It's me. I felt sick to the stomach.' The alleged victims claim the recordings, which have to be kept by the police department under state laws for several years, are criminal voyeurism. One woman said she first realized she had been filmed when a jailer allegedly commented on the way she had used the toilet. 'I felt even more violated because I knew they were watching,' she said.

"The parents of a pregnant mentally-disabled woman are trying to block a judge from holding hearings they fear could result in the compulsory abortion of her baby. The Nevada couple are the legal guardians of their 32-year-old daughter, who has the mental capacity of a six-year-old, and have exclusive authority over her health care decisions. Washoe County District Judge Egan Walker . lacks the authority to decide whether the woman should be allowed to give birth, according to a . motion to halt the proceedings that they have filed at the Nevada Supreme Court. Big issue: The parents of a pregnant woman with a mental age of six are trying to block a judge from holding hearings they fear could result in the compulsory abortion of her baby . The woman was living in a Reno group home when she wandered away from it and became pregnant 13 weeks ago. The child's father has not been identified. It is unknown whether . the pregnancy resulted from rape or consensual sex, according to the couple's attorney Jason Guinasso. The circumstances are under investigation by the county public guardian's office. Both the parents and the woman want her to carry the baby to term in line with their Catholic religious beliefs. The Supreme Court has set a deadline of noon today for the judge and county officials to respond to the request to halt evidentiary hearings into the woman's health. The hearings are scheduled to resume Tuesday. The couple acknowledges the pregnancy poses health risks to their daughter and the baby. But they say medical experts back them in their decision to continue the pregnancy. Mr Guinasso said: 'Does she understand all the risk? I doubt it. 'But we do know the guardians understand the risk, and they're the ones given the authority and responsibility to make the decision. They have a perfectly healthy baby and mother.' Six couples have expressed an interest in adopting the baby, the woman's parents said. Deadline set: A district judge lacks the authority to decide whether the woman should be allowed to give birth, according to a motion to halt the proceedings that they have filed at the Nevada Supreme Court (pictured) At a court hearing on Thursday, two medical experts testified that the pregnancy carries risks because the woman has epilepsy and is on medication. But they were split on whether the pregnancy should be terminated. The court gave the woman's parents guardianship for her when she became 18. Last month, the judge denied the couple's request to allow the woman to move back home with them and to halt the proceedings. Deputy District Attorney Dania Reid stressed there has been no motion or discussion to order an abortion in the case. She noted Judge Walker appointed the county public guardian's office as a 'neutral fact-finder' to investigate the pregnant woman's condition in regard to her medical, psychiatric and group home care. Mrs Reid said: 'It's not the county's role in this case to make any findings of conclusions whether or not this pregnancy should continue. That's entirely up to the court.' Olivia Gans Turner, spokeswoman for the Washington, D.C.-based organisations National Right To Life and American Victims Of Abortion, said the Nevada couple have drawn the support of pro-life advocates nationwide. She said: 'This is a cause we support. It's definitely their right to protect their daughter's right to have a child and to protect the life of their grandchild. 'There's no reason for this woman to be subjected to the danger and risk of an abortion because someone else thinks she's not worthy of having a child because of her mental condition.'","Nevada couple are legal guardians of their daughter, 32 .

Visitors can stay in the moon pod-like residence in St Ives, set in the middle of a private two acre lot, for £1,885 per week. The bizarre structure is located on top of St Ives town, surrounded by wildlife and frequented by herds of llamas and a goat called Billy. Michael Collins with his partner Eileen Sweeney outside the unusually-designed Escape Podz in St Ives . Michael Collins designed the Escape Podz accommodation after leaving his job at Salford University to start a new life in the south-west with his partner Eileen Sweeney. The luxury 'glamping' holiday let sleeps four and is based on a mathematical sphere known as a geodesic dome. There are two bedrooms, a kitchen, bathroom and hot tub and guests  can peer out at sweeping views through a 30ft panoramic window. While the strange shape has left some locals baffled, Michael says town planners are fully behind the  design. The spacious pod sleeps four and has two bedrooms, a kitchen, bathroom and hot tub . The first of many? Michael is already planning their second dome, but this one will be a therapeutic retreat . He said: 'I was made redundant from the University of Salford so Eileen and I decided to do something exciting in our lives. 'We had the idea of building a glamping luxury holiday let from a geodesic dome to see if there was any interest in the concept. 'We spoke to the planning department who, to our surprise, loved the idea. They agreed in principle to give us three years to trial the project, so we started to build it.

"(CNN) -- With home sales falling to five-year lows, homeowners desperate to sell their homes are looking for a little divine intervention. Retailers report statues of St. Joseph are selling briskly. Dawn Hoernemann of Minneapolis, Minnesota, had her one-bedroom home on the market for four months. Every weekend there was an open house. But there were no offers. That's until she took her mom's advice and buried a statue of St. Joseph upside down in her front yard. The next week, she had three offers and her home was sold. ""I couldn't believe it. I don't know what it is about it. It worked. It's some sort of a miracle,"" says Hoernemann. This ""miracle"" has it roots in Catholicism. According to the tradition, burying St. Joseph began hundreds of years ago in Europe. St. Teresa of Avila, a nun in the 16th century, buried a medal of the saint and prayed to St. Joseph to help secure land for a convent. The ritual is said to have worked, and so the trend of burying St. Joseph has caught on. Just ask Phil Cates of Modesto, California. His online retail site, StJosephStatue.com, offers the ""Underground Real Estate Agent"" home-selling kits. For $9.95, the 4-inch statue comes with a burial bag and a burial instruction booklet. There's even an 8-inch version of the statue for larger homes. Sales have increased 100 percent in the past two years, according to Cates. Robert Malhame, who runs Malhame & Co -- a Catholic supply company on Long Island, says sales of the St. Joseph Statue spiked last year. And he expects the trend to last. ""We're probably going to sell over 100,000 this year,"" he says. The biggest demand is coming from the Northeast and the Midwest, he says. Jan Wheelehan, the store manager at a Catholic retail supply store in St. Louis, Missouri, says the statues have been one of the better sellers, with sales increasing 25 percent this year. ""People seem more panicked and there is a hurried-ness to their expression when they come in,"" she says. St. Joseph is even on the auction block. There are dozens of St. Joseph home-selling kits on Ebay. From glow in the dark St. Joseph statues to mini pocket shrines, St. Joseph has a whole new following. Burying St. Joseph statues has its own set of rules, too, although they can vary. Home sellers are instructed to dig a hole near the ""For Sale"" sign. The hole should be three inches taller than the statue itself. The saint should then be facing the direction of the street. Then prayers to St. Joseph should be said before the saint is covered with dirt. Once the house is sold, St. Joseph should be dug up and put in a place of honor in the new home. Some renters have even cashed in on St. Joseph's divine intervention in hopes of getting a break on rent or to have their application accepted. They buried  St. Joseph statues in flowerpots. The statue's feet should either be facing the street or in the direction you want to move, according to Cates. The whole statue-burying process was a bit hard to swallow for Joe Iannacone. His Dallas, Texas, home was on the market earlier this month. Iannacone first heard about the ritual from his godfather. ""I looked on the Web. It was less than $10. So, I said why not?"" recalls Iannacone. Six hours later a young woman walked into the house and made a bid. ""I'm not very religious,"" says Iannacone. ""But that was pretty amazing. I was shocked."" St. Joseph may have made a believer out of some sellers, but for some real estate agents, selling a home isn't the work of a higher power. ""What a crock!"" says Connecticut real estate agent David D'Ausilio. ""As a Realtor I think it's ridiculous. The business has always been simple. If a house is properly priced and properly exposed, it'll attract buyers and it will sell -- St. Joseph or no St. Joseph."" Cates says the statue is more than just superstition. ""It's the idea of getting beyond yourself. It's about hoping and praying for something that is bigger than you are,"" he says. And these days, maybe just a little hope for home sellers isn't such a bad thing. E-mail to a friend .","With home sales falling, some sellers seek divine intervention .

"By . Simon Peach . Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino is well aware of the threat posed by Liverpool, but does not want his players to approach Sunday's encounter differently to any of their other matches this season. Spurs start the weekend top of the Barclays Premier League, having followed up a 1-0 win at West Ham with an impressive 4-0 thrashing of Harry Redknapp's QPR. That 100 per cent start to life under the former Southampton boss has extended to the Europa League, where a 2-1 win at AEL Limassol was followed up on Thursday by a 3-0 triumph in the second leg of their play-off tie. Scroll down for video... Same, same: Mauricio Pochettino doesn't want his players to treat the Liverpool game any differently . Tottenham go looking for a fifth successive win when Liverpool arrive in north London on Sunday - a match Pochettino wants his players to approach in the same manner as recent games. 'We are looking forward to Sunday,' he said. 'I think it is a great game, a tough game. We are looking forward to it. We will try to win the three points. 'For me, all games are a big a test. It is true that Liverpool were second last season and they have invested a lot of money on buying different players.

Hot Spurs: Harry Kane celebrates scoring against Limassol to extend Tottenham's unbeaten run to four game . Sunday's match offers Spurs a chance to gain revenge after the Reds, who secured one of the results of last season by winning 5-0 on their last visit to White Hart Lane. That match resulted in Andre Villas-Boas' sacking, although successor Tim Sherwood did not fare much better as his side went down 4-0 at Anfield. A similar humbling would seriously derail Pochettino's positive start, and is not a prospect he is even contemplating. 'We are in the beginning of this project,' he told Spurs TV. 'Only two months I have been at Tottenham. Red alert: Philippe Coutinho scores one of nine goals Liverpool hit past Tottenham last season . 'Liverpool have played the last two seasons in the same way, but without any doubt we try to put our philosophy to try and win the three points. That for us is important.

"They're seen as the easy targets during election campaigns by graffiti gangs and have often been the subject of battles between political candidates - but the defacing of election billboards or corflutes, as they are also known, is going to become a costly past-time now in New Zealand. With less than a month before the NZ election (September 20) some of the Kiwi political parties are getting all high-tech on vandals, installing hidden cameras to monitor their advertising boards. Police will be provided with the images of anyone caught on camera defacing the corflutes . Corflutes don't come cheap, just one can cost $10. The New Zealand Herald says that the National party has confirmed that some electioneering teams are already using motion sensor cameras and any act of vandalism or theft is passed onto police. If successfully prosecuted, vandals can be fined or, in the worst cases, face imprisonment. One Conservative Party member decided to act when he had his boards set alight. Another National Party politician claims more than 100 of his were destroyed in the first weeks of the campaign. It's not a problem restricted to NZ, of course. Some graffiti can be fairly basic but others go to great lengths, including going as far as transforming a conservative candidate to resemble an outrageous rock idol . All NZ parties have been targeted. This time Jacinda Ardern's billboard (of the Labour Party) is given a distinct pirate theme . In some Australian states anyone found to have made 'obscene or indecent representations' can face up to seven years in jail. During the 2012 Queensland elections, then Independent Member for Burnett Rob Messenger was targeted by vandals spraying Nazi symbols on his boards. Labor's Fowler MP, Chris Hayes, was one of those to have his signage damaged during last year's election campaign, as did his Liberal counterpart, Andrew Nguyen. Both chose not replace the damaged pieces because of the cost.","Hidden cameras have been placed around NZ election billboards to catch culprits .

"By . Sara Malm . Young women who spend a lot of time on Facebook are more likely to have a negative body image, a new study has found. Women in their late teens and early 20s were more likely to compare their own body with that of their friends if they spent more time on social media, and Facebook in particular. Researchers found a connection between increased negative feelings about their appearance and the young women’s Facebook number of hours, something which could lead to eating disorders and depression. Pressure: The more a young woman spends on Facebook, the likelier she is to feel negative about her body, a study has found . The study inquired into how often women of university age in Britain and the U.S. compared their bodies with their peers in relation to Facebook use, diet and exercise habits and body image. Researchers were able to predict how often women felt negatively about their own bodies after looking at someone else’s photos or posts, and how often women compared their own bodies to those of their friends. The more time a young woman spends on Facebook, the likelier she is to have negative feelings associated with her own body and the more she will compare her own to the bodies of friends. The study also found that women who want to lose weight pay more attention to their physical appearance the more time they spend on Facebook. Women who want to lose weight pay more attention to their physical appearance the more time they spend on Facebook . A 2013 survey found that 76 per cent of women want to lose at least 'a few pounds'. Two thirds of respondents used Facebook as their social media of choice and 75 per cent spend at least one hour a day on the platform. Although more than half said other people's Facebook posts about fitness and health inspired them, 22 per cent felt envious and 15 per cent said it made them feel guilty if they aren’t currently sticking to their own diet and fitness routine, according to women’s online magazine SheKnows. Previous studies have examined college or adolescent girls and the effect of Facebook on users’ body image over non-users’. However, this is the first study to link time spent on Facebook to poor body image. Petya Eckler, of the University of Strathclyde, Yusuf Kalyango, of Ohio University; and Ellen Paasch, of the University of Iowa, are due to present their findings at the 64th Annual Conference of the International Communication Association in Seattle. Doctor Eckler said: ‘Public health professionals who work in the area of eating disorders and their prevention now have clear evidence of how social media relates to college women’s body image and eating disorders. ‘While time spent on Facebook had no relation to eating disorders, it did predict worse body image among participants. ‘As experts in the field know, poor body image can gradually lead to developing an unhealthy relationship with food. ‘The attention to physical attributes may be even more dangerous on social media than on traditional media because participants in social media are people we know. 'These comparisons are much more relevant and hit closer to home. 'Yet they may be just as unrealistic as the images we see on traditional media.’","The more time a woman spends on Facebook, the worse her body image .

A boy had to be treated by his own mother after he was taken to hospital when a firework hit him in the chest setting fire to his jumper. Amy McCabe was on duty at Yorkhil Hospital, Glasgow, when Ben, four, was taken to A&E following a display outside their home in Cumbernauld. A rocket misfired, hitting him in the chest, setting his shirt on fire and causing severe burns. Amy McCabe was on duty when her son, Ben, was brought in with third degree burns . Ben's body is now covered in scars from where the firework burned his flesh after getting stuck in his coat . 'It was horrific,' said Mrs McCabe. 'Watching sick children come in is hard enough, but there's no bigger . shock than when it's your own child.' Ben underwent seven skin grafts and is now fronting a campaign against non-official firework displays. Husband . Alan, 39, family and neighbours had gathered to set off some fireworks. Everyone was kept at a safe distance, but in a freak accident one fired . into Ben's jacket. 'Nobody could see where the rocket had gone,' Amy said. 'The next minute Ben started screaming. We can't understand how it happened but the firework went inside his coat and set his shirt on fire.' Mr McCabe wrapped Ben in wet blankets until an ambulance arrived. But by the time he arrived at hospital, the intense heat had burned through his skin. He was rushed to theatre where doctors discovered third degree burns on his neck, chest and behind his left ear. Surgeons performed seven skin grafts to mend the damage. Ben spent three weeks in hospital, after contracting MRSA - a common infection in burns victims. When he was eventually allowed home, he needed to be treated with creams and have his dressings changed four times a day.. The firework display was outside Ben's house where he with family and friends . 'We . soon realised Ben was very fortunate,' Mrs McCabe, who is now a dental . technician, recalled.

Indeed, Rita loves the fuzzy neon wraps so much, she even posed for the Charlotte Simone campaign.

'Super-soft cashmere, really chunky knits, woven leather, shearling, silk, lambswool - the pieces have to feel great and the shapes are designed to be easy to wear,' Charlotte explained.

"(CNN) -- A Paris court has ordered eBay to pay $63 million damages to luxury goods company LVMH for allowing copies of its goods to be sold on the Web auction site. Louis Vuitton took eBay to court for selling a range of fake luxury goods online. The fashion company -- home to brands including Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Fendi, Emilio Pucci and Marc Jacobs -- complained it had been hurt by the sale of fake products on eBay. Pierre Godet, an adviser to LVMH Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, said the  court's decision was ""an answer to a particularly serious question, on whether the Internet is a free-for-all for the most hateful, parasitic practices."" eBay said LVMH was trying to crack down on Internet auctions because it was uncomfortable with its business model, which puts sellers rather than brands in control. ""If counterfeits appear on our site, we take them down swiftly,"" eBay spokeswoman Sravanthi Agrawal said. ""But today's ruling is not about counterfeits. Today's ruling is about an attempt by LVMH to protect uncompetitive commercial practices at the expense of consumer choice and the livelihood of law-abiding sellers that eBay empowers every day."" She said eBay intended to appeal the ruling. The case pit two pillars of their industries -- one old, one new -- in a country whose courts often challenge Internet companies on matters protected elsewhere by freedom of speech. The ruling faulted eBay for ""guilty negligence"" for not doing enough to prevent fake goods from being sold on its site. The court also ruled that eBay was responsible for the ""illicit sale"" of perfumes from the LVMH empire, which can be sold only through the brands' ""selective distribution networks."" The court barred eBay from running ads for the perfume and cosmetic brands or  face a fine of $79,000 per day. Heather McDonald, partner at law firm Baker Hostetler, said: ""eBay has policies and procedures in place where they will intervene in an action between a buyer and seller if there's a problem, and they profit directly on the basis of every item that is sold on their Web site. ""This gives them an affirmative obligation to take steps to make sure that illegal goods aren't sold, and they certainly have the ability to do that. ""They have been able to make sure that you can't buy a handgun and they have been able to make sure that you cannot buy pornography or prescription narcotics or other medicines on eBay. ""They have the ability to do this, they have just chosen not do and to rest the entire burden of policing eBay on the shoulders of the trademark and copyright holders whose rights are being infringed here.""","Paris court orders eBay to pay $63 million in damages to luxury group LVMH .

"Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has told how he is determined to fight for his life after being hospitalised with a 'deteriorating' condition. The 83-year-old statesman did not disclose the exact details of his illness but is known to suffer from an acute form of diabetes, for which he has previously sought treatment in Germany. However, Gorbachev, who is credited with bringing openness and reform to the Soviet Union - leading ultimately to its downfall - did not say where he is currently hospitalised. Illness: Former Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev said he is 'fighting for his life' as he battles a 'deteriorating' condition in hospital . He said: 'In the last seven days my condition was more or less well, but today I am in hospital. 'There has been a deterioration. I am lying under monitors, wires all over me.' He stressed: 'You know my character. It's focused on fighting, on life.' Gorbachev was president of the Soviet Union between 1985 and 1991 and is widely respected around the world for ending the Cold War. During his years in the Kremlin, he forged closer ties with the West, building relationships with both Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. The Nobel Peace laureate expressed annoyance that he could not follow this week's Nobel awards properly due to his illness. Last month he warned Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama not to let their mutual animosity deepen the current crisis over Ukraine. Breakthrough: Gorbachev pictured with then US President Ronald Reagan in 1987. He served as President of the Soviet Union between 1985 and 1991 and is widely respected around the world for ending the Cold War . Mikhail Gorbachev with Baroness Margaret Thatcher. She famously said of him: 'I like Mr Gorbachev, we can do business together' 'It is spoken that the current radicalisation is mainly a result of the personal relations between presidents Putin and Obama which are 'not shaping well',' said Gorbachev at the time. 'To me such a way of thinking is a huge mistake. 'We do not choose our partners and if our relations do not 'shape', we have a duty as leaders, a responsibility for our citizens and the whole world, and we should step over personal matters and stand for the interests of our nations.' He warned that 'for the sake of peace in Ukraine, in Europe and in the whole world, it is essential to resume the dialogue between Russia and the USA.' This was 'their role and responsibility' and they must set aside differences and start talking. 'It is inevitable if we do not want to kill the world where all of us now live. ' Mr Gorvachev's wife Raisa, who he married in 1953, died in 1999 from leukaemia. Loggerheads: Mr Gorbachev has been openly critical of current Russian leader Vladimir Putin . Mikhail Gorbachev took over the Kremlin in 1985 and began the process of economic and political reforms which ingrained the terms perestroika and glasnost on the western consciousness. In 1984 the then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously said of him: 'I like Mr Gorbachev, we can do business together'. He stepped down on Christmas Day 1991 handing over control to Boris Yeltsin and declaring the office of President of the Soviet Union dead. The Soviet Union was formally dissolved the following day. Popular in the West for the role he played in ending the Cold War, Gorbachev is disliked by many at home for the collapse of the Soviet Union and the years of turmoil that followed it. Gorbachev was intially supportive of current Russian leader Vladmir Putin praising him for bringing stability and economic reform to the country. But in recent years he has become openly critical of Putin's policies, warning that the lack of political competition, flawed elections and rampant corruption have stymied Russia's development. Earlier this year a group of Russian MPs made an extraordinary bid to have Gorbachev prosecuted for the 'illegal' collapse of the Soviet Union more than two decades ago. One MP in Vladimir Putin's United Russia Party even branded 83-year-old Gorbachev a 'US spy' for the break-up of the Communist state 23 years ago. Gorbachev called the MPs' move 'sheer stupidity', adding: 'These people just do not have shame.'","Former Soviet leader, 83, did not give exact details of his condition .

But now the Welsh National Coal Museum is acknowledging power sources of the future - and installing solar panels. The Big Pit museum has turned to renewable energy to power its buildings in Blaenafon, south Wales. More than six per cent of Big Pit’s energy will be generated by 200 solar panels installed on the museum’s roof in a bid to reduce bills and carbon footprints, museum representatives said. Green energy: The main building of the Big Pit National Coal Museum in Wales set to be fitted with solar panels . Despite complaints from some of the ex-miners who work as guides at the museum the most common reaction to the new energy source has been positive, the Guardian reported . 'Coal is such an important part of Wales’ heritage and yet green energy will play a major part in its future,' Peter Walker, museum manager at Big Pit said. 'A solar powered coal mining museum is a fantastic way to celebrate this national journey.' Mr Walker added that the panels will also bring economic benefits to the museum in reducing energy bills.

Mark Richards, Director of Operations and Deputy Director General for Amgueddfa Cymru, said he was ‘delighted’ to be moving towards green energy at the coal mining museum. ’As a working coal mine we are here to celebrate one of the world’s oldest energy sources and an enormously important aspect of Welsh heritage. But it is important to look to, and plan for, the future.’ The Big Pit won the Gulbenkian Prize . for Museum of the Year in 2005 for 'keeping the story of British coal . alive,' and is one of Wales most popuar tourist attractions.

"(CNN) -- Three anti-whaling activists were injured in a clash with Japanese whalers off the coast of Antarctica on Wednesday when the Japanese crew used grappling hooks against pursuit boats, the conservation group Sea Shepherd said in statement. The environmental group claims two of its crew from the anti-whaling ship Steve Irwin were struck in the shoulder with iron grappling hooks and one crewmember was struck twice in the face with a long bamboo pole. The group said the incident occurred at about 3am (Australian Eastern Daylight Time) in waters 300 miles north of Mawson Peninsula in Antarctica. Sea Shepherd claims the Japanese whaler Yushin Maru No. 2 continued to tail the Steve Irwin which is in Antarctic waters attempting to disrupt the Japanese whalers.

Die Aktuelle, a women's lifestyle magazine, has come under fire for trying to deceive its readers into thinking this is the first picture of Michael Schumacher since his skiing accident - it is actually from January 26, 2013 . The magazine has been accused of tricking readers into believing this is the first photograph of Schumacher since he sustained brain injuries in a freak skiing accident last December. It claims that stricken Schumacher, 45, is 'pushed on to the terrace by (his wife) Corinna on mild autumn days' in his wheelchair. The photograph was actually taken in St Moritz, Switzerland, on January 26, 2013. The German news magazine Focus branded the cover 'deceptive'. Online publication Motorsport.com said: 'How low can you go? it seems that there is no limit for certain publications. 'The majority of readers will not notice the date of the photograph which is written in small typeface.' The German news website news.de said: 'Die Aktuelle proves once again that for the publication there's no bad taste that's too bad. The sole objective is to increase circulation.' When Schumacher was in a coma, a photograph of Schumacher was splashed on the front with the headline: 'Woke Up!'

Schumacher, 45, was transferred from a hospital in Grenoble, France, to Lausanne Hospital, Switzerland, in June and he is now being cared for at his home on the shores of Lake Geneva . It is not the first time that the magazine has been accused of attempting to deceive readers with Schumacher-related stories. When Schumacher was in a coma, a photograph of Schumacher was splashed on the front with the headline: 'Woke Up!' The article was in fact about the experiences of three other people who had awoken from a coma. The German motoring racing legend cannot speak and has memory problems. He is paralysed and in a wheelchair according to former racing driver Philippe Streiff. Schumacher, 45, was transferred from a hospital in Grenoble, France, to Lausanne Hospital, Switzerland, in June and he is now being cared for at his home on the shores of Lake Geneva. It was December 29 when he suffered a freak ski accident in the French Alps which left him brain damaged and fighting for his life. Schumacher, a very competent skier, was holidaying with family and friends in Meribel, where he owns a chalet. He was skiing with his 14-year-old son on a red piste, which is classed for intermediate skiers. But he lost control and hit a partially-covered rock. He was then catapulted 34 feet on to another rock. He smashed his head on the bolder. The force of the collision shattered his helmet. His wife Corinna has been a constant presence at his bedside. With an accumulated wealth estimated to be well over half-a-billion pounds, Schumacher's family is well placed to provide the limitless care that will be needed in the coming years. This will include physiotherapists, to massage his atrophying joints, doctors, nutritionists, nurses and neurological experts.","Die Aktuelle, a women's lifestyle magazine, published controversial cover .

"A teacher whose phone was stolen then used to rack up £15,000 in bills by foreign thieves has been told by Vodafone that he must pay for the calls. Osian Rhys Edwards from Barmouth, Gwynedd, was on holiday in Barcelona in August when his phone was stolen after he asked for directions from locals. The 29-year-old phoned Vodafone to report the theft, but is now being held accountable for thousands of pounds as the company claims it has no record of his call. Scroll down for video . Osian Rhys Edwards was told to pay the £15,000 bill despite claiming to report his phone stolen on the night of the theft . The primary school teacher now faces financial ruin after being told to hand over £15,000, including £2,500 in VAT. 'It's clear that I have been the victim of fraudsters but Vodafone wants to hold me responsible. 'I can't believe that this is allowed to happen. If I'd lost my bank cards, the banks would soon stop them when they spot unusual activity but even though I reported my phone stolen, Vodafone not only says I'm liable, but it is probably making money out this,' he told the Guardian. Records show that phone calls to two Spanish numbers at premium rates were made on the night of the theft. Shortly after the incident Mr Rhys Edwards says phoned Vodafone  from a payphone in Barcelona to cancel his contract. But upon his return to the UK, he discovered the company had no record of the call. There is no hope of tracing the call now as logs are deleted after 60 days, the company said. While the provider has agreed to reduce the £15,031 bill by 30 per cent, it still holds him accountable for more than £10,000. 'Despite not reporting the theft of his phone for four days, we have offered to reduce Mr Edwards' outstanding charges by 25%. 'In the light of our failure to call him back when we should have done, we will increase this offer to 30%. The primary school teacher now faces financial ruin as despite the company reducing the bill by 30 per cent, he has been told to pay more than £10,000 . Pickpockets in the Catalan city target tourists and use their phones to place premium-rate calls before the handsets are blocked . 'We are also prepared to discuss a payment plan,' a spokesman said. Mr Rhys Edwards is the latest victim of pickpockets in the Catalan city who steal mobile phones and use them to place premium-rate calls in quick succession before the handset is blocked. Sarah Harvey, an NHS worker from Brighton, was told to settle a £5,800 bill run up after her phone was stolen in the same city. Georgia Harris, a recruitment worker, was initially told to pay £21,000 after her phone was stolen in 2013. Vodafone later withdrew its demand she pay for the foreign calls. In 2012, the telecoms regulator Ofcom ordered mobile phone companies produce plans to cap customers' bills. But the plans were never produced, and the issue was handed to the government with which companies are thought to be in continuing discussions.","Osian Rhys Edwards had his phone stolen in Barcelona in August .

"A student at Brown university has tested positive for a date-rape drug after drinking alcoholic punch at a party where a female student was allegedly victim of a sex assault. Tests confirmed the unnamed student had GHB, a colorless, odorless sedative, in their system after an October 17 party where she drank at an event by the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. The female student, who has claimed she was sexually assaulted after drinking at the same party, also drank the punch. Her tests results have not come back yet. Sex assault: A student at Brown University, pictured, said she was sexually assaulted after a frat party. Tests have now confirmed date-rape drugs were used on another student at the party . Campus officials at the school in Providence, Rhode Island, warned students about the drug in an email update on the case, reported today by the Providence Journal. Margaret Klawunn said the two students felt 'a rapid onset of intoxication'  and 'memory loss for a significant period of time' beyond anything they would expect from the amount of punch they drank. Denial: Members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, who hosted the event, say the drugging and alleged assault are nothing to do with their members . She went on to warn students about GHB (gamma hydroxybutyrate), describing it as 'a colorless, odorless drug that can be hard to detect in a drink... but has a strong sedative effect that is incapacitating.' The fraternity has been suspended in the wake of the accusations, officially for holding a party with alcohol present without asking permission. Members of Phi Kappa Psi have angrily denied any involvement in the drugging or alleged assault.

"A fizzy drinks tax could save thousands of children from diabetes, a study has claimed (file photo) Thousands of children would be saved from diabetes, cancer and heart disease later in life if a 20p tax is added to the cost of sugary drinks, researchers have claimed. Health experts and Boris Johnson’s food adviser in London are pushing the idea under moves by the mayor and local authorities to devolve some taxation powers to the capital. Academics from the University of Liverpool calculated the effects of introducing a tax equivalent to 20p per litre in London with the aim of reducing consumption of the high-calorie drinks over 20 years. They calculated the levy would prevent 1,100 cases of cancer in the capital, reduce the number of people who develop diabetes by 6,300 and cut 4,300 from the total of those who suffer from coronary heart disease or strokes. The work also suggests the health service in London would save around £39million over 20 years. Based on these numbers, tens of thousands of disease cases nationwide could be prevented if the 20p per litre tax was adopted across the entire country. The figures were released by the Children’s Food Campaign, which proposes that any revenue generated by the tax would pay for programmes to improve children’s health. Malcolm Clark, Campaign co-ordinator of the CFC, said: ‘A duty on sugary drinks of 20 pence per litre would be the most practical and effective way of tackling a significant source of unnecessary calories and sugar in children and young people’s diets. ‘Mexico, France and Hungary have introduced a sugary drinks duty, and their citizens are reaping the benefits. 'Our politicians can no longer hide behind the idea that it wouldn’t be popular, or is an untried policy. ‘We urge London’s mayor and council leaders to include a sugary drinks duty in their review of how London might manage devolved taxation powers, and to make the case to Westminster for the introduction of such a duty nationally.' More than 60 organisations – including the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, the British Dietetic Association, the Faculty of Public Health, CitizensUK, Netmums and Unison – have already backed the campaign. Rosie Boycott, who was appointed by Mr Johnson to run the London Food Board, said: ‘We need a tax on sugary drinks. Unhealthy: The proposed measure is the latest in a long line to curb deteriorating public health (file photo) ‘Sweetened fizzy drinks offer nothing to a city already suffering high levels of obesity-related diseases and dental decay,’ she said. ‘It would be good for our health and the environment if we drank less of them. In many areas, London has already been leading the charge in the battle to eat well. 'But we also need national action to ensure firms contribute to the overall health bill and encourage consumers to swap to healthier products.' Soft drinks are the largest single source of sugar for children aged four to ten and teenagers. A tax of 20p a litre would add around 7p to the price of a can of Coca-Cola or Pepsi. The idea is also supported by the internationally renowned surgeon Lord Darzi, of Imperial College London. Gavin Partington, the director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, said: ‘This is a poorly thought out political proposal which will hit the poorest hardest while doing nothing to curb obesity, the causes of which are far more complex than this simplistic approach implies. ‘Evidence from France shows that while sales of soft drinks fell after a tax was introduced in 2012, they have increased since, with sales up 6 per cent in the first four months of this year. ‘Policy should be based on evidence, not a tendentious report based on a flawed model.’","Tax proposed by Children's Food Campaign would be 20p per litre .

"Basketball star Dwight Howard is under criminal investigation for child abuse in Georgia following allegations that he beat his six-year-old son with a belt buckle, according to reports. Law enforcement sources have revealed that the Houston Rockets center admits he hit son Braylon with a belt, but insisted that he did not know it was wrong because he was hit as a child, TMZ reported. The website previously stated that the Department of Children and Families (DCF) in Florida determined there was not enough evidence of child abuse to go forward with the case. Basketball star Dwight Howard is under criminal investigation for child abuse in Georgia, according to reports . But since the incident occurred in Georgia, police from the state asked Florida for the file. A Georgia law enforcement source reportedly told TMZ that 'people who were not so forthcoming before today [Monday] have been'. The source added that detectives conducted a number of one-on-one interviews and said that the case 'has now been raised to top of the list'. The case concerns allegations put forward by Braylon's mother, Royce Reed, who reportedly filed a complaint saying Howard had whipped their son with a belt, leaving the boy with bruises and abrasions. On Monday, TMZ Sports quoted from documents obtained from the DCF summarizing the findings of the doctor who examined the boy. The case comes two weeks after NFL star Adrian Peterson, 29, pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault for disciplining his son . The doctor  reportedly discovered injuries 'consistent with Braylon being struck with the buckle end of the belt' and 'consistent with a medical diagnosis of physical abuse'. The documents allegedly state: 'Dr Kesler noted Braylon to have a linear bruise and patterned abrasions consistent with the history given by Braylon of being struck with a belt numerous times by his father.' Howard's attorney told TMZ that Reed is 'shopping her baseless allegations' to Georgia authorities, even though Florida's Department of Children and Families found her claims had 'no merit'. His rep said: 'It is troubling to see a mother use her son as a pawn against his father,' and that Howard, 28, will do 'whatever is necessary to protect [the child's] welfare and best interests'. DCF found the allegations credible, according to TMZ, but concluded they did not meet the standard of proof required for formal action. Howard's attorney told TMZ that he is confident Georgia will reach the same conclusion as the Florida Department did because 'The truth is on our side'. The case comes just two weeks after NFL star Adrian Peterson, 29, pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault - down from a felony charge of child abuse - for disciplining his son with a wooden switch. The child, who has not been named, was left with cuts, marks and bruising to his thighs, back and one of his testicles, according to court records - and backlash from the public was strong. The Minnesota Vikings' star running back was spared jail, but has been suspended without pay for at least the remainder of 2014 season.","The boy's mother reportedly filed complaint saying Howard had whipped their six-year-old son with a belt, leaving bruises and abrasions .

"The joint industrial park, one of the key symbols of cooperation between North and South Korea, re-opened Monday after a five-month hiatus. South Korean vehicles and freight trucks waited in traffic as they prepared to cross through customs and immigration into the North Korean city of Kaesong, where the industrial park sits. Activity at the Kaesong Industrial Complex ground to a halt in April amid mounting tensions between the two neighbors. As tensions eased, intense negotiations to re-open the complex resumed after several false starts. Choi Dong-jin, a South Korean who operates a jeans factory at Kaesong, expressed his relief as the shutters were finally lifted. ""Words cannot describe how happy we were after we heard the news,"" Choi said. All 123 companies operating in the zone experienced heavy losses after Kaesong's closure, and in Choi's case, the figure amounted to US$3 million. ""I've invested all of my capital in Kaesong. After the shutdown, we couldn't do any business,"" he told CNN from the small office in Seoul he'd been forced to operate from since April. The Kaesong Industrial Complex, which is considered to be an important source of hard currency for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's regime, sits just a few kilometers north of the DMZ, which divides the two Koreas. Its closure followed a sustained escalation of tensions on the Korean peninsula, set off by North Korea's long-range rocket launch in December and an underground nuclear test in February. The subsequent tightening of sanctions announced by the U.N. Security Council resulted in increasingly menacing rhetoric from the North, who threatened to attack the South with a pre-emptive nuclear strike. With South Korean workers and supplies barred from entering the region, the last remaining workers left Kaesong in May. ""The unexpected event happened and we couldn't keep our promises to our clients,"" Choi recalled. ""We had our own losses, but the clients had their losses too. There was no contingency plan."" After several offers from Seoul to end the impasse, the two Koreas finally agreed to reopen Kaesong last week with an agreement that the industrial zone's operations would no longer be ""affected by political situations under any circumstances."" But for some of the affected businesses, the damage may be difficult to reverse. ""Yes it is going to re-open, but the question is 'how long will it take to recover our company's credibility from the client?' Until we gain back their trust again, they won't request a large order,"" Choi said. After it was opened in 2005, about US$2 billion worth of goods have been produced at Kaesong, according to the South Korean Unification Ministry, making it important to the North's ailing economy in particular. North Korean workers there earn an average of $134 per month, 45% of which are taken by North Korean authorities for various taxes.","Kaesong Industrial Complex reopens Monday after five-month closure .

"(CNN) -- In the middle of a shooting spree that killed three people and unleashed terror on Southern California motorists Tuesday morning, Ali Syed told one of his carjacking victims to walk away, police say. ""Mr. Syed ... said, 'I don't want to hurt you, I killed somebody. Today's my last day. Give me your keys,' "" Tustin Police Chief Scott Jordan told reporters. According to preliminary accounts from police, Syed, 20, didn't intentionally spare another target. Police say they believe Syed, a part-time college student, fatally shot a woman at his family's Ladera Ranch home before killing two other people -- including a senior citizen executed outside his vehicle -- and wounding three others as he fired a shotgun at Orange County motorists on the Costa Mesa Freeway and committed three carjackings. The spree ended when Syed died after he turned his gun on himself as police approached on a road north of Tustin, authorities say. The Orange County Sheriff's Department says it was called to the Ladera Ranch home, where Syed lived with his parents, on a report of shots fired about 4:45 a.m. PT. A woman in her 20s was found dead there. Police said she wasn't related to Syed, but they didn't release her name, and they said they didn't know why she was at the home. Syed left the home in his parents' SUV, police said. About 25 minutes after that police call and 20 miles to the northwest, Syed drove into a Denny's and Big Lots parking lot in Tustin, exited the vehicle and shot a driver in the back of the head, Jordan said. The wounded motorist -- a man who was waiting for his son to carpool with him to work -- managed to drive away before stopping near an overpass, Jordan said. The victim was being treated Tuesday, police said. That's when Syed, whose SUV had a flat tire, approached the man he would spare. Syed ran toward the man at a nearby gas station, took his keys and drove the pickup truck away without firing at him, Jordan said. Syed then drove south on the Costa Mesa Freeway, exited onto a transition road, got out of the vehicle and fired a shotgun at southbound vehicles on the freeway, hitting three vehicles, police said. One of the freeway drivers was wounded in the hand and face, but investigators don't know whether the wounds were from shotgun rounds or debris, according to Jordan. Police said Syed then drove to nearby Santa Ana, crashing the pickup into a curb on a freeway off-ramp. There, he pointed the shotgun at Melvin L. Edwards, 69, of Laguna Hills, who was in a BMW at a stop sign. ""Syed ... got (Edwards) out of the car at gunpoint, walked him across the road and executed him -- shot him three times,"" Jordan said. Syed drove Edwards' BMW to the parking lot of a Tustin-area Micro Center computer store, where police said he found his next two shooting victims. Syed shot and killed Jeremy Lewis, 26, of Fullerton, who was in a vehicle in the lot, police said. Lewis had worked at a construction site across the street. People from the construction site then approached, and Syed shot and wounded one of them in the arm, Jordan said. Syed entered that person's vehicle and drove north on the Costa Mesa Freeway before exiting again. By that time, authorities had received many phone calls about the shootings, and California Highway Patrol officers found Syed driving at an intersection about 5 miles north of Tustin, Jordan said. Syed exited the vehicle as it slowly rolled near the intersection, according to police. ""There really wasn't a confrontation at that very end,"" Jordan said. ""As soon as he got out of his vehicle, before it actually came to a complete stop, he shot and killed himself,"" Jordan said. Syed was unemployed and taking one class at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo, an Orange County Sheriff's Department spokesman said. Police said they're trying to determine what led to the shootings, and that they didn't yet know of a motive. CNN's John Fricke contributed to this report.","Ali Syed killed three, wounded three during spree that involved carjackings in Orange County, police say .

"Did business disputes play a role in the dramatic demise of Kim Jong Un's once powerful uncle? That's what South Korea's main intelligence agency appeared to suggest Monday in comments relayed by a lawmaker. The uncle, Jang Song Thaek, was considered instrumental in Kim's rise to power two years ago. But Kim turned his back on the man once seen as his protector in spectacular fashion earlier this month, having him executed on charges he tried to overthrow the government. Jang's death was announced in an unusually public declaration from the secretive state. Analysts have put forward a variety of reasons that may have led to Kim's decision to turn against his uncle and to publicize his execution. Some suggested there may have been a struggle for power between Kim and Jang. Pinning down the truth may prove impossible for a reclusive regime like North Korea. But agents at South Korea's National Intelligence Service, which broke news of Jang's initial fall from power before North Korea announced it, are nonetheless trying to get to the bottom of the situation. The agency briefed lawmakers of a parliamentary intelligence committee Monday about what it thinks was behind Jang's downfall. The head of the agency, Nam Jae-joon, played down the theory of a simple power struggle between Jang and Kim, said Jeong Chung-rae, a lawmaker from the United Democratic Party who attended the briefing. Based on the intelligence agency's analysis, Jang's aides in certain government agencies involved in business projects, including coal and trade, overstepped their authority, creating conflicts with other agencies, the lawmaker said. The agency believes Kim may have stepped and demanded that the disputes be resolved -- an order Jang apparently declined to carry out, Jeong said. That decision may have cost Jang his life. ""Jang was purged for violating the supreme leadership, according to the NIS report,"" Jeong said. North Korea state media made some references to business wrongdoing by Jang in their expansive recounting of his alleged crimes. ""The Jang group put under its control the fields and units which play an important role in the nation's economic development and the improvement of people's living in a crafty manner, making it impossible for the economic guidance organs including the Cabinet to perform their roles,"" the state news agency said in the official report announcing Jang's removal from his posts. It said he had sold off ""precious resources of the country at cheap prices."" Analysts have said that Jang, who was close to Chinese officials, was believed to have a more open mind about capitalist forms of economic development than hardline members of the regime. By discounting the theory of an outright power struggle between Kim and Jang for control of the regime, the South Korean intelligence agency said it believes Kim's position at the top is stable. The regime is still investigating many of the agencies under Jang's control, the NIS said, according to Jeong. It also said that it believed that images that showed Jang being dragged out of a large meeting were part of a choreographed event to demonstrate Kim's power.","South Korea's intelligence agency offers an analysis of Jang Song Thaek's execution .

"(CNN) -- Barack Obama's daughters are moving into a house with a swimming pool, a bowling alley and its own movie theater. Sasha Obama, left, and Malia Obama will make the White House home come January 20. When their father is inaugurated on January 20, Malia Obama, 10, and Sasha Obama, 7, will also be moving into a place where they'll not only be under the watchful eye of the Secret Service but also under the eye of the media. ""One of the negatives of the White House is that its very much a fishbowl,"" presidential historian Doug Wead said. ""There's something that Sasha or Malia will say or do and they'll be remembered for it for the rest of their lives,"" said Wead, who wrote ""All the Presidents' Children,"" a book on the lives of kids at the White House.  Watch what life's like for White House kids » . Theodore Roosevelt's children used to like to drop water balloons on foreign dignitaries, Wead said. They also let their pet snake slither around the White House dining room. John F. Kennedy Jr. was known for hiding under his father's Oval Office desk. His older sister, Caroline, had a pony who romped untethered around the White House grounds. President Abraham Lincoln's youngest son, Thomas, used to startle everyone in the building by making all the White House bells ring at one time. But with the mischief and pranks comes a lifetime of pressure, said Noah McCollough, who wrote the book ""First Kids."" ""John Quincy Adams' kids went through alcoholism and addiction because they couldn't live up to their parents expectation"" in their later years, McCollough said.  Read up on the blessed and star-crossed lives of some other White House kids » . Much of Malia and Sasha's White House experience will be monitored by their mother, Michelle Obama, who seems determined to be active in their lives. Even as her husband campaigned for the presidency, Michelle Obama was a soccer mom, cheering from the sidelines of her daughters' games. ""I'm a mother first. And I'm going to be at parent-teacher conferences, and ... I'm going to be at the things that they want me to attend. I'm not going to miss a ballet recital,"" Michelle Obama said. Together with the president-elect, she'll have to decide where the girls will attend school. ""If they send their child to a private school they'll be called elitist for betraying the public school system,"" Wead said. Jacqueline Kennedy, not wanting Caroline being hounded by the media as she went to school, set up a first-grade classroom on the third floor of the White House. Ten of Caroline's friends also attended, each bringing their own lunch pail. President Jimmy Carter sent daughter Amy, age 9 when she moved to Washington, to the public Hardy Middle School. President Bill Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, attended the private Sidwell Friends School. No matter the choice, even their grades will come under public scrutiny. ""If you flunk that huge math test, it's on the front page of the newspaper the next day,"" McCollough said. But assuming no one gets grounded for bad grades, imagine the possibilities for sleepovers or parties. President Gerald Ford's daughter Susan, for example, held her senior prom at the White House. Whatever the educational choice, the Obamas have made clear their kids won't be an afterthought now that Barack Obama is about to become the world's most powerful person.

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- China on Tuesday continued its diatribe against Japan over the arrest of a Chinese fishing captain and demanded his immediate release. ""Japan provoked this situation and Japan should take all responsibilities,"" said Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Jiang Yu. ""We urge the Japanese to stop so-called legal procedures and let him return safely and immediately."" The captain's fishing trawler crashed into two Japanese patrol boats last week off the disputed Diaoyu Islands, in the East China Sea. He remains in custody, accused of obstructing Japanese public officers while they performed duties. On Monday, his 14 crew members returned to China. The Japanese coast guard freed the crew members after completing an investigation, a coast guard official told CNN. Their detention angered Beijing, which repeatedly summoned the Japanese ambassador, demanding their release. Beijing says the Diaoyu Islands and most of the South China Sea belong to China, disputing neighboring countries' claims. The clash over territorial waters and islands -- and the natural resources that go with them -- is a flashpoint in the Asia-Pacific region. ""Chinese people have expressed strong indignation to this, and this fully embodies the Chinese people's resolve to defend national sovereignty,"" Yu said. ""The islands has sovereign rights, and no one can change that fact."" ""If you read history documents, Chinese first discovered the island and put it in effective administration,"" Yu added. Word of the fishermen's arrest has led to irate reactions from some of the Chinese public, as seen in online posts. On Sunday, a Japanese school in northeastern China was fired on with small BBs, presumably in connection with the fishermen's arrest. The Japanese Embassy in China said: ""We have received report from Japanese School of Tianjin. The Japanese Embassy contacted relevant departments of Chinese government, requiring relevant departments to strengthen security at the school, to guarantee the safety of the students at Japanese School, as well as all the Japanese in Tianjin.""

"Anthony McErlean not only faked his own death but had also been claiming pensions relating to his late father-in-law from a previous marriage .

Sentencing McErlean, 66, who has convictions dating back to 1963, judge Adele Williams told him the 'deliberate and calculated fraud’ had been carried out 'to gratify your overweening greed’. His case at Canterbury Crown Court bears striking similarities to that of John Darwin who faked his demise with wife Anne in a £680,000 insurance swindle before fleeing to Panama. He and his wife were jailed in 2008 after he reappeared claiming to have lost his memory. McErlean’s bogus claim was made to Glasgow-based Ace European Insurance in the name of father-of-two McErlean’s Honduran wife Sonya. The fake witness statement, from a man named Ronald Lodge, recounted the tragic account of how McErlean was killed in December 2009. He was, apparently, knocked over as he tried to change a tyre on his vehicle during a wildlife photography trip in Honduras. The fake death certificate on which, in a complete giveaway, insurers found McErlean's own fingerprints . The 'witness’ described how farm workers transported McErlean to a small village where local people 'took care of the body’. The following month insurers received . documents, reputedly from McErlean’s wife, which included a death . certificate, police report into the crash and a claim form for the . conman’s accidental death policy. At an earlier hearing at Canterbury . Crown Court prosecutor Donna East said: 'The company expressed some . suspicions about the claim.’ Detectives found McErlean’s . fingerprints on the bogus death certificate and matched them to prints . already held. The conman had served three and a half years behind bars . in 1975 for robbery. He was arrested and during police . interviews said he 'didn’t want to be destitute in old age’, claiming he . got into £150,000 worth of debts while looking after his terminally ill . first wife. He said his second wife had no knowledge of the scam and that he had obtained the documents by bribing officials in Honduras. After being charged with fraud earlier . this year McErlean was freed on strict bail conditions banning him from . trying to leave the UK. But the day after his release from custody last . March he applied for a new passport claiming he had lost his last one – . which had been seized by police. Detectives intercepted the new passport and re-arrested McErlean several days later.

Neighbours there said his first wife Christine died of cancer and he married Sonya Regalado, who was ten years younger than him. In 2009 they moved to Honduras, where she is still believed to be living. She was not treated as a suspect in the case. Echoes: The case bears similarities to that of back-from-the-dead John .

Thieves are cashing in on the devastating floods by stealing warning signs to sell for scrap metal, it has been claimed. The theft of the signs in the past month has led to dozens of motorists driving into flooded areas unaware and getting stuck in their cars after their engines conked out. One car which may have been a victim was a £60,000 Audi which was stripped bare by thieves after the driver abandoned it after driving into floodwater in Chertsey, Surrey, last month. A BMWs which attempted to cross Trescott Ford near Wolverhampton appears to have been abandoned and looted . The abandoned car near Wolverhampton was left with smashed windows, as councils across the country reported incidents of alleged looting . The BMW 5 series was left in over two ft of water as the country was battered by floods and gale force winds . Council chiefs in Surrey said the 600 signs - stolen from all over the county, but particularly in Spelthorne and Runnymede - would cost £23,000 to replace. Local Grant Garvey, 36, said: 'Whoever is taking the signs should know they are the worst kind of thieves. 'They are removing important safety signs to sell on for just a few quid in scrap metal - they have no thought at all for other people.' A Surrey County Council spokesman said: . 'We have been appalled during the flooding by the theft of warning . signs, which are there for the safety of our residents and motorists. Stuck in the mud: This £60,000 sports car was abandoned by its owner when its engine stopped on a flooded road and within a fortnight was 'ripped to shreds' by thieves . Vanished: All of the car's plush fittings have been taken and its remains have been left to rust on the roadside . 'In Spelthorne and Runnymede, about 600 signs have disappeared at a total cost to our contractor of about £23,000. 'This theft is a cynical and dangerous act at a time when many people are in difficult and distressing circumstances.' In the flood-stricken Somerset Levels meanwhile, three more alleged fuel thieves have been arrested.

"Washington (CNN) -- William Henderson Foote was a lawman of the highest order in his small town of Yazoo City, Mississippi, when he died in the line of duty more than a century ago. He'd once been the town's constable, town marshal and circuit clerk while serving in the Mississippi legislature. And on Monday, Foote was remembered and recognized as the first African-American federal office killed in the line of duty. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) posthumously awarded its Gold Star Medal to Foote, who served as a post-Reconstruction-era deputy collector with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Internal Revenue -- a predecessor agency to today's ATF. Foote was honored 128 years after his death as part of National Police Week. Several of Foote's descendants were in attendance and Foote's great-grandniece, Bettye Gardner, a professor of African-American history at Coppin State University in Baltimore, Maryland, accepted the award. In December 1883, on what would be his last Christmas Eve, Foote intervened to protect an African-American man from being lynched. In the scuffle, three white men in the lynching party were shot and killed, but Foote ended up being put in prison. Four days later, Foote was killed by a lynch mob that stormed the prison where he was held. He died December 29, 1883. ""They wanted him out of that job, that was a white man's job,"" said Gardner. Foote's name is the latest to be added to ATF's Memorial Wall. As a part of a larger effort to honor all fallen agents of law enforcement, ATF has gone back through historic annals to excavate overlooked stories of heroism like Foote's. ""It was very important once I saw that he had slipped through the cracks of history that we make sure that we bring him and his story to life here at ATF,"" said ATF historian Barbara Osteika, who discovered William Foote's story in a New York Times article from decades ago. On the wall beside Foote's name is the name of William L. Pappan, an agent of the then, U.S. Department of Treasury, Bureau of Internal Revenue, Alcohol Tax Unit, who died in 1935 as the first Native American federal investigator killed in the line of duty. ""It was too long, but the fact is we're not perfect in getting all of the names up on the wall. But, it's my passion to make sure each and every agent that served to protect our communities against violent crime -- each and every one of them that has lost their life in the line of duty -- will get on our wall,"" said Osteika. Foote was born a free man in 1843. And the period following the Civil War was a complicated one, explained the keynote speaker of Monday's event, Sharon Malone, wife of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. ""The shocking thing to me, actually being a Southerner, (was) finding out that there were free black people in the state of Mississippi at the turn of the 19th century, not the 20th,"" said Malone who hails from Alabama and is her family's historian. She added, ""We tend to know only one narrative of life in the South, and that is of slave and slave owners. But there is a very rich and varied history that we have yet to tap in to."" While Foote's story of sacrifice has recently gained public attention, his has been a story of family lore for generations of his ancestors. ""It's just been a wonderful legacy come to life,"" said Patricia Nolcox, who is Foote's great-granddaughter. ""And, the interesting and important thing is that it wasn't new to them (the family), they knew the story also. We had pictures, we talked about it. But, it was just our story, the family story,"" she said, as she stood beside her cousin, Gardner. The process of documenting Foote's story brought both a new perspective to the African-American experience during the period of Reconstruction, and also brought an extended family together. ""I hadn't seen her since she was a toddler,"" Nolcox said of Gardner as they stood side by side in ATF's atrium. ""I'm the oldest descendant and I'm proud of it,"" she added. ""The real legacy is to understand that black people, people of color have been involved and have been patriots in this country from its very inception,"" said Malone.","The ATF honors William Henderson Foote, who was killed 128 years ago .

"Unusual: The jet-black variety is said to be healthier than its red cousin as it has more anti-oxidants . We're already growing purple carrots, yellow courgettes and white asparagus. But black tomatoes are the must-have crop for greenhouses this season, growers say. Not only will the dark toms turn heads at the allotment society, they are also healthier than normal red varieties, according to plant scientists. The new tomato starts out as a normal green fruit, but ripens to a jet-black colour. On sale for the first time this year, the new ‘Indigo Rose’ was cultivated by breeding red and purple tomato plants, and is being heralded as a new superfood. Scientists in America bred purple tomatoes contained anthocyanin, an antioxidant said to help fight diabetes and obesity, with normal red varieties. Devon-based Sutton Seeds have secured the rights to start selling the new plants in the UK for the first time this spring. Alfie Jackson, assistant product manager at Suttons Seeds of Paignton, Devon, said: ‘They are not as sweet as normal tomatoes and have a more savoury flavour, and are nice roasted or eaten in salads. ‘There are some dark coloured tomatoes but Indigo Rose is the only real black tomato and is the darkest that has ever been bred. ‘It was bred by Professor Jim Myers at the University of Oregon in the US and came about after a graduate student was interested in looking at health benefits in tomatoes. ‘They found some tomatoes with purple pigmentation and tests revealed that anthocyanins were providing the colour, the same as blueberries. ‘They crossed the purple tomatoes with some wild tomatoes and eventually came up with a black strain. This is the first time they have been available to buy in the UK. American nutritionists advise people eat the less sweet version to fight obesity and help diabetes . ‘During the growth process it starts out green like all tomatoes and when the sun hits the fruit it turns black rather than red.’ Demand for vegetable seeds and plants have soared in the last fortnight, as gardens come to life following a miserable winter. Gardeners are opting in increasing numbers for rare crops such as okra, purple carrots and specialist vegetables used in stir fries such as Pak Choi, oriental mustard and red hot chillies, which fetch high prices in the supermarkets. Homebase buyer Orla Forde said 26 per cent of all homeowners in the UK now possess a vegetable plot. ‘An entire generation is rediscovering the delicate flavours of vegetables cooked straight from the garden,’ she said. ‘Increasing food prices are driving households to become more self-sufficient.’","Dark tomatoes 'healthier' than red variety, according to plant scientists .

"By . Steve Nolan . PUBLISHED: . 06:40 EST, 27 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:33 EST, 27 February 2013 . Thug: Timothy Hagar, 26, who has been jailed for six-and-a-half years at Teesside Crown Court after viciously attacking dad Sean Cole outside his home in Loftus, East Cleveland . A father was beaten up so badly by a thug after asking a drunken gang to move away from his home that he had to quit his job because of his injuries. Timothy Hagar attacked oil worker Sean Cole and stamped on his head with 'full force' as he lay unconscious outside his home in Loftus, North Yorkshire, in April last year. He kicked Mr Cole so hard that he had blood splatters on his right trainer and a piece of flesh embedded in the heel following the attack. He was too ill to work and had to give up his £4,000-a-month job. Mr Cole was so badly injured that his five-year-old daughter did not recognise him when he was released from hospital. Hagar, 26, was jailed for six-and-a-half years yesterday after admitting inflicting grevious bodily harm with intent at Teeside Crown Court. The court heard that offshore worker Mr Cole had stepped outside his home with his wife Louise and asked the group, which included Hagar, to move away from the house. But Hagar kicked the couple's dog in the head and then subjected Mr Cole to an 'appalling' attack, knocking him unconscious and kicking him in the head and chest. Mrs Cole feared that her 43-year-old husband was dead as she rushed to his aid and screamed for help as he lay motionless on the ground. He suffered a double jaw fracture and lost teeth in the attack, and still suffers from numbness down one side of his face, according to prosecutor David Crook. Mr Cole was so ill that he was forced to give up his job and moved his family to Scotland. But the family has since hit financial trouble and have been served with an eviction notice. In a victim statement read out to the court, Mr Cole said: 'I will never forgive the man for what he did. 'My own wife thought I was dead. She witnessed the attack. 'One thing that still upsets me is that the day I was released from hospital, I saw my children and tried to cuddle them. Sentence: Hagar was jailed for six-and-a-half years after admitting GBH with intent at Teeside Crown Court, pictured . 'My five-year-old daughter got scared and ran off. She did not believe I was her father because I didn’t look like him.' Hagar, a binge-drinking supermarket warehouse worker, was so drunk he could not remember the attack, but was said to be ashamed of his actions. When his mother saw the aftermath of the trouble, she said: 'If it’s my son who’s responsible, I’ll disown him', the court was told. Paul Newcombe, defending Hagar, said: 'He is at a loss to explain his behaviour. All he can venture is that he drank an enormous amount.' In a letter of apology to his victim, Hagar, of Redcar, North Yorkshire, said: 'I am sincerely sorry for what happened to you, and I am completely and utterly ashamed of myself.' Judge Simon Bourne-Arton, QC, told Hagar he had ruined Mr Cole’s life through 'seconds of gratuitous, mindless violence'. After Hagar was sentenced, Detective Constable Matthew Waterfield, from Cleveland Police, said: . 'This was an horrific incident and the victim has shown strength and courage throughout this investigation. 'We are pleased with the sentence which reflects the true nature of the danger that Timothy Hagar poses. 'This should spell a warning for anyone thinking of taking part in alcohol-fuelled violence.'

"Equatorial Guinea will replace Morocco as hosts of the Africa Cup of Nations. Morocco will not host the 2015 tournament because of its fears over the Ebola outbreak elsewhere on the continent, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) confirmed. As a result CAF expelled Morocco, who would have qualified as hosts, from the finals. Equatorial Guinea have replaced Morocco as hosts of 2015 African Cup of Nations starting on January 17 . Confederation of African Football (CAF) president Issa Hayatou decided to expel Morocco from the tournament . It is an oil-rich nation which became independent from Spain in 1968 .

It has a tropical climate - it will be the dry season in Bioko but wet in Rio Muni . Co-hosted the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations with Gabon . Capital Malabo is one of four venues along with Bata, Ebebiyin, Mongomo. Three nations expressed an interest to host the tournament due to take place from January 17 to February 8. Equatorial Guinea were also thrown out of the tournament in July for fielding an ineligible player during the qualifying process, but will now be reinstated as hosts. The man who organised the 2008 event in Ghana has already expressed fears that starting the cup on time will be impossible. Dr Kofi Amoah said: 'It could be a sham. I don't think there is enough time for anyone to do it.' CAF President Issa Hayatou insists: 'The 2015 Africa Cup of Nations must absolutely take place from January 17th to February 8th.'

Qualification matches for the tournament will continue as planned on Friday and Saturday to decide which 15 teams will join the new host country for the finals. Morocco had expressed fears an influx of foreign fans could help spread the Ebola epidemic. The North African country is scheduled to host Fifa's Club World Cup next month, featuring Champions League winners Real Madrid.

"The admirable show of respect between players when they swap shirts is usually reserved for the end of a match, not half-time. But during the break between Chelsea and Liverpool on Sunday, a few of the players saw fit to get in early and bag themselves their opponents' shirts with 45 minutes left on the clock.

"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez pledged closer cooperation on Monday, vowing to fight poverty and imperialism. The two leaders signed a series of accords in the areas of industry, science, technology and politics, the state-run AVN news agency reported. Sitting side by side in front of a room full of reporters, they presented a united front in their opposition to the United States. ""It's clear they are afraid of our development,"" said Ahmadinejad. Earlier, at a welcoming ceremony outside the Venezuelan presidential palace, the Iranian president called Chavez his ""dear brother,"" and said his nation has peaceful intentions. ""Our weapon is logic. Our weapon is culture. Our weapons are human values,"" he said. Chavez pledged to work with his Iranian counterpart to stop the ""imperial insanity"" of the United States, which he described as a ""threat for the world."" The Venezuelan president mocked concerns from Washington about his country's relationship with Iran, joking that U.S. media reports made it sound as though he and Ahmadinejad would be launching missiles and bombs at the U.S. capital. ""We are not warmongers,"" Chavez said, as the Iranian president nodded in agreement. ""Iran has not invaded anybody."" It's no coincidence that Venezuela is Ahmadinejad's first stop on a four-nation Latin America tour this week. Despite their cultural differences, Venezuela and Iran have found significant common ground: Both are among the world's top crude oil exporters, and their leaders are strong allies united by a fierce opposition to what they describe as U.S. imperialism. The Iranian leader arrived in Caracas on Sunday and is traveling with his ministers for foreign affairs, energy and economy, according to IRNA, Iran's official news agency. Over the years, the two nations have signed more than 270 accords, including trade deals and agreements on construction projects, car and tractor factories, energy initiatives and banking programs. Chavez has also helped the Islamic republic forge relationships with other members of the Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas, an eight-nation regional bloc Chavez founded. Even before he arrived, Ahmadinejad's plans for a Latin American tour grabbed global attention, as tensions grow between many Western powers and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program. Officials in the United States and other Western nations have ratcheted up sanctions against Iran several times since a November report by the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency said the Iranian government was developing the technology needed to build a nuclear weapon. Last month, U.S. President Barack Obama announced sanctions against Iran's central bank. On Monday the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency confirmed that uranium enrichment has begun at a nuclear facility in northern Iran. Iran says there's a medical purpose behind the nuclear program. But in Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland said the confirmation that Iran was enriching uranium to ""a level that's inappropriate"" is ""obviously a problem."" Not everyone in Venezuela is happy with Ahmadinejad's visit. Diego Arria, an opposition politician, described the trip as a ""provocation"" to the United States and an embarrassment for Venezuela. ""It comes at the worst moment -- at a time when Ahmadinejad is being looked at by the international community with great fear. ... It's bringing the threat to the United States closer to home,"" he said. The Iranian president is scheduled to visit Nicaragua, Cuba and Ecuador later this week as part of his five-day tour.

There are few details about when or where it was taken, but it seems to have appeared originally on an Argentinian Facebook page around a month ago, suggesting the people in it are Latin American. The image sparked panic when it was posted on blogs which campaign against domestic abuse. No Longer Victims shared the photo, saying: 'If there is anybody that can help us to find this child, please please do so.' The blog later added: 'A baby can be traumatised like anybody that is a victim of abuse - and this is a form of abuse.' Facebook users have reacted with outrage to the image, with some calling it 'downright evil'. It is not known whether the gun shown in the picture is in fact real, or whether it is a capgun or a prop weapon. However, many people have suggested that even if it is some sort of replica, it is nonetheless irresponsible to expose such a young child to gun violence.","Origins of image unknown but it is believed to come from Latin America .

"Online retailing giant Amazon has launched its own brand of diapers, opening a new front in retail battles - and a direct challenge to name-brands already selling on the site. Amazon said the first offerings in its new Amazon Elements line of consumer products would be diapers and baby wipes, and that other competitively priced, 'premium' everyday consumer products would soon follow. But the Elements line is only available to members of Amazon's Prime $99-a-year subscription club, with the lowest prices available for those who are also members of its Amazon Mom group, as the company seeks to push more shoppers into its membership programs. Time for change: Amazon is launching the line of diapers and baby wipes exclusively for its Prime members to get more shoppers to sign up for the $99 annual program . Expanding: The launch comes a year after Amazon reported it was recruiting people to help create its own brand of products in the larger category known as consumables . Amazon highlighted that the Elements line would provide quality-conscious shoppers 'an unprecedented level of information' on product origins and materials. 'The two things customers told us they want are premium products that meet their high standards, and access to information so they can make informed decisions,' said Sunny Jain, Amazon.com Consumables Vice President, in a statement. Entering the market: The first offerings in the new Amazon Elements line of consumer products will be diapers and baby wipes . The initial prices, including discounts to Prime members and the Amazon Mom club, put a size 4 diaper 10 percent more expensive than the popular Huggies brand. But it was about 27 percent cheaper than the premium Seventh Generation brand, popular with health and environmentally-conscious consumers, in the Prime and Amazon Mom pricing. Amazon has been seeking to push shoppers into Prime, originally a subscription service for free shipping aimed at frequent buyers on its website. A Prime subscription now gives members unlimited video and music streaming as Amazon takes on powerful media groups like Netflix and Spotify. In some areas, Prime is now offering same day delivery on groceries as well.","Suppliers had long feared Amazon would eventually elbow them aside .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Funeral services were held Friday for a 13-year-old Palestinian boy shot and killed while playing soccer in Gaza a day earlier. A spokesman for the Gaza Health Ministry accused the Israel Defense Forces of killing the boy, identified as Ahmed Abu Daqa. Read more: Gaza truce gets off to a shaky start . Initially, the ministry said the boy was shot in the head by an Israeli helicopter. Witnesses disputed that account Friday, saying the boy was shot in the side and the gunfire came from Israeli military vehicles. Israeli Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich told CNN that an initial investigation by the military ""did not indicate the Israeli military had any connection to the shooting."" She said the military was reviewing video footage of the area and so far had not seen anybody in the area where the shooting is said to have occurred. The incident occurred on a day marked by Israeli military activity inside Gaza and on its border with Israel. Leibovich said that 300 meters inside Gaza, Israeli border soldiers had discovered a cache of explosives in a tunnel adjacent to a security fence. Read more: Israel airstrikes target Gaza, killing at least 16 . After the soldiers returned to their post on the border and set about repairing the fence, an explosion erupted, the military said. A soldier sustained minor injuries and an unoccupied army vehicle was blown up. Palestinian sources said that, before the boy was shot, a number of Israeli military vehicles and tanks had entered Gaza some 500 meters east of Khan Younis, where they came under fire from militants. The tanks responded by firing two rounds towards farmland; no one was injured in that incursion, they said.

"Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon remains a doubt for Friday's World Cup match against Costa Rica, and centre back Andrea Barzagli could also be missing after injury problems. Buffon twisted his left ankle and knee before the Azzurri's opening game against England and watched from the bench as Salvatore Sirigu filled in admirably for him in a 2-1 win while Barzagli has a tendinitis problem. Anything but a win for Italy in their second Group D game would send England crashing out of the World Cup, so Three Lions supporters will be praying for the fitness of the legendary Italian 'keeper and the Azzurri's first choice centre back. Getting there: Buffon trained for Italy on Thursday but is still suffering from swelling to his injured ankle . Missing link: Key defender Barzagli could be the latest player that the Italians lose to injury . Coach Cesare Prandelli said Buffon: 'had three great days of training but the ankle is still slightly swollen. If he feels good after today's training he'll play.' Barzagli was held out of training Wednesday due to a tendinitis problem that bothered him all season with Italian champions Juventus. Key duo: Buffon and Barzagli would be a couple of big misses for the Italians if they are ruled out by injury . Able deputy: Sirigu performed well in Buffon's absence and could be called upon again by Prandelli . 'Barzagli is better but we'll evaluate him tomorrow morning,' Prandelli said. If Barzagli is unable to play, Leonardo Bonucci could take over in defense alongside Giorgio Chiellini. Easy does it: Buffon saves a shot during the session but might not be back in time to face Costa Rica .","Buffon could miss second World Cup game with ankle still swollen .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . PUBLISHED: . 07:42 EST, 10 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:53 EST, 10 December 2013 . Ketamine should be upgraded to a Class B substance, Government advisers have said. The drug, also known as Special K, is currently rated Class C. But the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) has now recommended that it should be reclassified because of the mental and physical harm it causes. Ketamine should be upgraded to a Class B substance, Government advisers have said. The drug, also known as Special K, is currently rated Class C . Ketamine users as young as 20 are having to have their bladders removed due to heavy consumption of the drug, ACMD chairman Professor Les Iversen warned earlier this year. Normally, the bladder wall expands when filled with urine and contracts when emptied. But extreme ketamine use can cause stiffness and scarring in the bladder walls, meaning it can only expand to a tenth of its normal size. Some drug abusers face wearing a catheter for life. Originally designed as an anaesthetic and tranquilliser, often used on horses during veterinary surgery, ketamine was banned as a recreational drug in 2006. An estimated 120,000 people used it in England and Wales during 2012/13, figures suggest. Home Secretary Theresa May commissioned the ACMD in March last year to refresh its advice on ketamine, which was last reviewed in 2004. Home Secretary Theresa May commissioned the review into ketamine last year after mounting medical evidence showed the harm it can cause . The council said: 'The ACMD recommends that ketamine be controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971) as a Class B substance. 'This was not a unanimous decision but it is a majority recommendation from both the council and its Ketamine Working Group. The advice says that 'although there is limited evidence of ketamine misuse causing social harm, evidence of physical harm  - mainly chronic bladder toxicity' - has increased since the last recommendation of 2004. If the drug is upgraded to Class B, people caught with it in their possession could face up to five years in prison and ketamine dealers could be jailed for up to 14 years. Other Class B drugs include cannabis, amphetamines, such as speed, and barbiturates. Earlier this year surgeons in Leeds, London and Bristol said there were a growing number of young people struggling with severe side effects. Teenagers are having their bladders stretched and removed as a result of taking it. David Gillatt, one of the UK's leading urological surgeons, told Channel 4 News he had removed three bladders by June. He said: 'Ketamine gets into the urine and inflames the bladder, it makes the lining come off like a burn. As it tries to heal itself, it scars and becomes a small shrunken bladder. 'Some users experience pain in the lower abdomen, blood in their urine and problems controlling their bladders.'","The drug, also known as Special K, is currently rated as Class C .

"Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is ordering an independent review of the nation's nuclear force following revelations of misconduct involving officers, the Pentagon said on Thursday. Top leaders of the force plan to meet with Hagel in coming weeks, Defense Department spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said. The action follows a recent disclosure that nearly three dozen Air Force officers at a nuclear missile base in Montana were involved in cheating on a proficiency test. That followed a decision by senior military officials to discipline a general with nuclear oversight responsibilities whose personal misbehavior involving alcohol and women on an overseas trip got him into hot water. Kirby said ""clearly, we've got some issues here,"" but added the Pentagon remains confident the U.S. nuclear arsenal is secure. Earlier this month, the U.S. Air Force announced 34 officers with the 341st Missile Wing were implicated in the cheating scandal after a drug possession probe that involved two of those officers. Sixteen officers were ultimately found to have actually cheated on the monthly proficiency exam while the rest knew the answers had been shared with others and did not report the violation, the Pentagon said. All those disciplined in the investigation are no longer certified to conduct nuclear operations. There are approximately 190 officers overseeing readiness of nuclear weapons systems in Montana, meaning the scandal has touched nearly 20% of that force. Other scandals include October's news that Air Force Maj. Gen. Michael Carey, who oversaw nuclear weapons, was relieved of his duties after he boozed, fraternized with ""hot women"" and disrespected his hosts during an official visit to Russia, Air Force officials said. There was no indication Carey's behavior compromised sensitive nuclear information or went beyond drinking, dancing and fraternizing with the women, officials said. Also in October, Navy Vice Adm. Tim Giardina, who also oversaw nuclear weapons forces, was formally relieved of his duties as deputy chief of U.S. Strategic Command, according to Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Navy's chief of information. A military official said his demotion was connected to allegations that he used counterfeit gambling chips at an Iowa casino. In August, the same missile unit at Malmstrom linked to the test cheating scandal failed a safety and security inspection ""after making tactical-level errors -- not related to command and control of nuclear weapons,"" the Air Force Global Strike Command said. The 341st Missile Wing operates about 150 of the 450 Minuteman III nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles in the U.S. force, according to an Air Force statement. A failed inspection does not mean that the safety of the nation's nuclear arsenal is at risk, global strike commander Lt. Gen. Jim Kowalski said in August. And in April, an Air Force commander stripped 17 of his officers in Minot, North Dakota, of their authority to control and launch nuclear missiles after they did poorly in an inspection. They were ordered to undergo 60 to 90 days of intensive refresher training on how to do their jobs.","Incidents of misconduct prompt call for independent review .

A drinker who killed a Strictly Come Dancing lighting technician outside a kebab house in a ‘senseless and brutal attack’ after he mocked the size of his nose was yesterday jailed for six years. Ben Worden, 33, of Welling, south-east London, punched Paul Gunner, 32, twice last October and sent him crashing to the ground in an act of ‘random street violence’ in Bexley, south-east London. Mr Gunner, who had been out celebrating his 32nd birthday, died from massive brain injuries within an hour of being struck outside the kebab shop after his skull fractured ‘like a plate breaking’. Attack: Ben Worden (left), 33, of Welling, south-east London, punched Paul Gunner (right), 32, twice last October and sent him crashing to the ground in an act of ‘random street violence’ in Bexley, south-east London . Worden and his victim, who was employed by BBC contractor Set and Strike to install and dismantle TV sets, had been drinking in nearby Bar Lorca before their paths crossed in the takeaway last year. Violence flared at the Charcoal Grill store after Mr Gunner asked his killer: ‘What are you looking at, you big-nosed c***?’ Worden then struck his victim twice before running off and bragging to a group of women about his vicious attack. He told them: ‘I’ve just smashed someone up - look at my knuckles.’ ‘Despite having laid out Mr Gunner including, we suggest, seeing and hearing his head hit the pavement, he made no attempt to stay and help the injured man,’ Timothy Cray, prosecuting, said. ‘Instead, he fled from the scene with two friends he had been drinking with that evening. Far from showing concern of remorse, his attitude was to boast about what he had done. Moments before: This CCTV handout issued by the Metropolitan Police shows Paul Gunner, 32, inside a kebab shop in Bexley, south-east London before he was fatally attacked by Ben Worden . ‘He was pleased with himself.’ Mr Cray added: ‘He had no need to attack Mr Gunner in the first place and, more seriously, at the time of the second punch, he could easily have walked away. 'What are you looking at, you big-nosed c***?' What Paul Gunner asked Ben Worden . ‘In all his actions amounted to thuggish behaviour, random street violence that had the most tragic consequences.’ Witness Clive Williams said Mr Gunner had crashed to the ground after he was struck. ‘He hit his head onto the road, and all I could hear was a sound that was like a plate breaking,’ he said. Worden admitted throwing the first punch but claimed it was his friend, James Parsons, who had delivered the fatal blow. ‘I hit him,’ he said. ‘With my hand on his face, in a clenched fist. ‘I hit him on the left side of his face. At the time I didn’t think it was that hard, but he fell straight over.’ Sadness: The parents of Paul Gunner (right) - Peter and Andrea (left) - have been at Inner London Crown Court .

Mick Philpott’s ‘shameless’ lifestyle was fuelled by a welfare system which encouraged him to have children for the benefit money they generated, Ann Widdecombe said yesterday. The former Government minister, who spent a week living with the Philpott family for a television documentary, said the father of 17 treated his offspring as ‘meal tickets’. The former Tory Home Office Minister spoke amid a debate over the welfare system’s role in fostering families such as the Philpotts, as sweeping Government reforms aimed at halting a ‘culture of dependency’ come into force this week. Scroll down for video . Meal tickets: The former Government minister spent a week living with the Philpott family for a television documentary . She was backed by councillors in Philpott’s home city of Derby and a local MP, Nigel Mills, in blaming the benefit system for encouraging Philpott’s dysfunctional family set-up. But the Philpotts’ MP, Labour’s Margaret Beckett, said the family were not reflective of benefit claimants in general. Philpott raked in tens of thousands of pounds a year in child benefit, working family tax credits and the wages of his wife and mistress, Lisa Willis, 29, who both worked as cleaners. In the 2007 documentary Ann Widdecombe Versus The Benefit Culture, the then MP found Philpott three jobs but he failed to keep any of them. She said yesterday the ‘prime purpose’ of Philpott’s children was to ‘serve his convenience and provide his benefits’. Conman: Ann Widdecombe said she was appalled by a state system which allowed a man to live in this way . In the 2007 documentary Ann Widdecombe Versus The Benefit Culture, the then MP found Philpott three jobs but he failed to keep any of them . She branded Philpott’s attempts to portray himself as a devoted father and house husband a pathetic con. She said: ‘I’m appalled by what happened to the children and that now wipes out everything else, but before this happened I was appalled by a state system that allowed a man to live in this way so blatantly. 'He tried to portray himself as a house husband, but that was nonsense, he didn’t do anything.’ Conservative councillor Mick Barker, who represents the Oakwood ward at Derby City Council, said: ‘You might think the Philpotts were dysfunctional, but believe me, they were not exceptional and not unique. ‘Everyone in the police knew of Mick and the fact he was using his children to live a life of luxury on welfare, but he was one of dozens of people the authorities dealt with every day who did the same thing.’ Childline founder Esther Rantzen joined neighbours and former friends of the Philpotts in criticising social services for failing to intervene in the family over the decade Philpott lived with his wife, lover and the children. She said Philpott’s history of domestic abuse and the ‘pernicious’ impact violence, fights and arguments would have had on the children should have been enough for them to have stepped in. Derby City Council has refused to comment on the extent of its involvement with the family ahead of a serious case review, but has admitted the children were ‘not subject to child protection plans or legal orders’.

Substitute Nuhiu rifled home to settle the second-round tie at a half-empty Turf Moor after Jason Shackell had upended Jeremy Helan.

Booked: Maguire, Coke . Goals: Nuhiu 78 . Referee: Geoff Eltringham . Att: 4,979 . Burnley wanted a penalty themselves in injury time when Ashley Barnes went down but nothing was given. The final whistle was greeted by a roar from the away fans, who had made the most noise all night with many Burnley supporters having decided to stay away. The match, coming between home Premier League games against Chelsea and Manchester United, was always likely to be a hard sell for the home club. While a packed Turf Moor was rocking last Monday, the top tiers of two stands were empty on this occasion and there were plenty more vacant seats in an echoey atmosphere. That seemed to have an effect on the pace of the game, as did the seven changes made by Burnley boss Sean Dyche, whose alterations included debuts for summer signings Matt Gilks and Stephen Ward. Opposite number Stuart Gray - who had a brief spell in caretaker charge of the Clarets almost four years ago - included former England goalkeeper Chris Kirkland among his four changes. Full-blooded: Both teams put in a committed performance but it was Wednesday who ran out winners . Opposite number Stuart Gray - who had a brief spell in caretaker charge of the Clarets almost four years ago - included former England goalkeeper Chris Kirkland among his four changes. Michael Kightly should have given Burnley an early lead but mis-kicked in front of goal before former Hull defender Kamil Zayatte poked wide at the opposite end. Wednesday spurned another good opportunity when Gary Madine headed narrowly over from a Chris Maguire corner. Burnley and Long then had a major let-off when the defender slid in to cut out a Maguire cross and turned the ball against his own woodwork for what was almost a spectacular own goal. Going in where it hurts: Sheffield Wednesday's Kamil Zayatte  gets there first in Tuesday's clash at Turf Moor . After that the Clarets began to settle and dominate possession. Ross Wallace, who earlier shot at Kirkland from distance, had a free-kick deflected over. Barnes should have done better when picked out by Wallace but headed wide from in front of goal. Scott Arfield had a speculative effort from a free-kick inside the centre circle but Kirkland saved comfortably enough. Gilks might have been extended before the break after a Jeremy Helan run but a deflection took the pace out of his shot. Composed: David Jones starts an attack for Burnley in the Capital One cup clash on Tuesday . Burnley tried to up the tempo after the restart with Barnes testing Kirkland and Marvin Sordell shooting over on the turn. Wednesday enjoyed a good spell with Madine heading at Gilks and Maguire shooting into the side-netting. But chances started to open up for Burnley as substitute Matt Taylor shot wide after a goalmouth scramble and Barnes missed the target with a header. It came against the run of play when Wednesday got their penalty as Shackell fouled Helan on the right of the area. Nuhiu fired straight down the middle for his third goal in two games as Gilks dived to his right.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- For the majority of people in the West banking is as easy as walking to a local branch or ATM, or logging into their account from a computer. But for millions in developing countries, even having a bank account is out of reach. In India, at least, that could be about to change. Vodafone India and ICICI Bank, India's largest private bank, have launched M-Pesa, a mobile-based money transfer and payment service that was first established in Kenya in 2007. The partnership, announced in a news release April 17, claims it will give mobile-banking access to some 700 million Indian people who are currently ""unbanked"" -- people with no access to conventional banking services like bank branches and ATMs. Vodafone says service will first rollout in India's eastern regions, including Kolkata and West Bengal, with 8,300 agents. That part of India is home to about 220 million people. Service will eventually be extended across the rest of the country. The M-Pesa system -- where ""M"" stands for mobile and ""pesa"" is the Swahili word for money -- begins with real cash and an M-Pesa agent. A customer signs up, registers a personal mobile phone number and deposits money into the linked account at an agent store, which could be a mobile phone shop, a gas station or a supermarket. To send money, the user inputs a recipient's mobile phone number, the amount of money to send and a security code for protection. To withdraw funds, the receiver visits an M-Pesa agent and requests a withdrawal through his or her mobile phone. Both the receiver and the M-Pesa agent then receive a confirmation for withdrawal, which instructs the agent to give the customer cash. Bills can be paid and mobile talk time can also be bought through the platform. ""For millions of people in India, a mobile phone is a bank account, a front door to a micro-business or a lifeline to people in the remotest areas,"" said Marten Pieters, Managing Director and CEO of Vodafone India. ""Research shows that M-Pesa brings real benefits to users in their daily lives, saving three hours a week of their time and around $3 in money transfer costs -- a significant amount to people in some areas."" Greater cell phone penetration also brings greater economic benefit to local economies, often far removed from urban centers in large developing countries. A 2006 University of Michigan study found that every 10% increase in cell phone penetration grows the local economy by 0.6%. In 2011, India alone added 142 million new mobile phone subscriptions -- twice as many as in the whole of Africa, and more than in Europe, the Middle East and the former Soviet republics combined, according to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in a June 2012 report.

"There are many ways to measure 30 years, but for Glenn Ford, the yardstick is simple. ""My sons -- when I left -- was babies. Now they grown men with babies,"" he said, speaking as a free man for the first time in nearly three decades. Ford, Louisiana's longest-serving death row prisoner, walked free Tuesday after spending nearly 30 years behind bars for a murder he did not commit. ""My mind's going all kinds of directions, but it feels good,"" Ford, 64, told reporters outside the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, according to CNN affiliate WAFB. One reporter asked whether he harbors any resentment. ""Yeah, because I was locked up almost 30 years for something I didn't do,"" said Ford, who wore a denim shirt, a hat and dark-rimmed glasses. ""Thirty years of my life, if not all of it,"" he said, WAFB reported. ""I can't go back."" According to the Capital Post Conviction Project of Louisiana, a judge ordered that Ford be freed Monday after prosecutors petitioned the court to release him. New information corroborated what Ford had said all along: that he was not present at nor involved in the November 5, 1983, slaying of Isadore Rozeman, the project said. ""We are very pleased to see Glenn Ford finally exonerated, and we are particularly grateful that the prosecution and the court moved ahead so decisively to set Mr. Ford free,"" said Gary Clements and Aaron Novod, Ford's attorneys. They have argued his trial was compromised by the unconstitutional suppression of evidence and by inexperienced counsel. Ford had been on death row since 1984, making him one of the longest-serving death row prisoners in the United States. ""After 30 years, Louisiana's longest-serving death row prisoner will get his freedom soon,"" Amnesty International USA senior campaigner Thenjiwe Tameika McHarris said in a statement shortly before his release. ""Glenn Ford is living proof of just how flawed our justice system truly is. We are moved that Mr. Ford, an African-American man convicted by an all-white jury, will be able to leave death row a survivor."" Innocent man: How inmate Michael Morton lost 25 years of his life .

"England's players will be ordered to hit the Boks with a backlash at Twickenham on Saturday - to avoid a fifth consecutive Test defeat and end eight years of suffering against the world's No 2-ranked side. Stuart Lancaster's men go into Saturday's QBE series encounter on the back of four straight losses to New Zealand — knowing there is 'no hiding place' if they fall short again. Amid all the talk of the Springboks being in wounded-beast mode after their defeat in Ireland last Saturday, the hosts, including Danny Care winning his 50th cap, are ready to unleash frustrations of their own. England's Danny Care will win his 50th cap against South Africa at Twickenham on Saturday . England's players gather for a team talk during the captain's run at Twickenham on Friday afternoon . England head coach Stuart Lancaster watches his players prepare for Saturday's QBE series encounter . 'Of course there's going to be a backlash after the fourth defeat,' said forwards coach Graham Rowntree on Friday. 'That is being said in our camp. 'The guys are beating themselves up about it; we're beating ourselves up about it. That was at the start of the week. But you get out on the training field, start sorting things out and move forward.' The quality of the opposition will not serve as an excuse for English failure. Rowntree added: 'We've simply got to beat these teams, at Twickenham Twickenham. We keep coming close. They (South Africa) are the next big southern-hemisphere team to come to our stadium; we've got to beat them, we know that. And we'll go in all guns blazing to do that. 'The fact that we've not beaten them for X amount of years is almost irrelevant. We've just got to win this next game. There is an expectation on us, there certainly is within. Forwards coach Graham Rowntree insists England will react positively after defeat to New Zealand last week . Courtney Lawes (centre) prepares to play a pass as England's players train ahead of facing the Springboks . 'We are desperate to win. You can't hide the fact that we lost the last four games. There's no hiding place; we had some very frank discussions but you've quickly got to move on.' England scrum-half Danny Care will win his 50th cap at Twickenham on Saturday and the 27-year-old acknowledged that team development must soon give way to tangible success. 'I still think we are learning, but it will come to a time when the learning needs to stop and we need to get results,' he said. 'We have shown in patches just how good we are, but we need to turn that into 80-minute performances. The belief is there. We've got it, and we need to put it on the park.' Saracens star Brad Barritt receives a pass during the captain's run at Twickenham on Friday . None of the home players have experienced a Test victory over South Africa, but visiting captain Jean de Villiers is wary of taking too much confidence from that. 'A big part of our group never experienced beating the All Blacks and we managed to do that earlier this year,' the Boks skipper said. 'It's the old thing about records; they're there to be broken. We certainly don't want them to.' But England are still wary of the South African threat after losing to the All Blacks and forwards coach Rowntree said: 'It will be a huge challenge, but we need this challenge after last week.'

"Michelle Obama has revealed that there is one look that she feels she can't pull off: shorts. The First Lady is regularly hailed for her fashion sense but said that she felt she stepped across the bounds by showing off her legs. During a visit to BET talk show '106 and Park', she cited one of her more casual trips on Air Force One as her biggest fashion faux pas. No go: The First Lady, seen here in 2009 with her daughter Malia, said that there was some backlash after she wore shorts on Air Force One so she doesn't really wear shorts anymore . Fashion forward: Michelle Obama made an appearance on BET's talk show '106 and Park' on Tuesday . 'Sometimes as First Lady, sometimes I forget I’m the First Lady and I’m running around in shorts,' she said, referring to an August 2009 trip to the Grand Canyon. 'I know the first time we went on a family vacation, I had shorts on getting off of Air Force One and that created a huge stink because people were like, she’s wearing shorts getting off of Air Force One. And I thought, ""what, we’re on vacation!""' Since that backlash, she has shied away from wearing shorts, opting for longer capris or skirts and dresses in hotter climates. She also cools off by opting for sleeveless shirts that show her toned arms- including in her official White House portrait. Raising eyebrows: She said that the problem arose because sometimes she forgets that she is the First Lady and should dress as such at all times . Other than the slight slip up in 2009, Mrs Obama wasn't able to think of any other fashion missteps. 'I kind of always am happy with what I’m wearing,' she said. Mrs Obama said that in addition to every fashion choice being scrutinized another downside of living in the White House is the lack of anonymity. 'Being able to walk out your front door on your own without agents, people following you around,' she said. 'I just long to walk out that front door, go to CVS and buy some toothpaste, and nobody would notice me.' She said that it was easier for her to go on dog walks or unannounced trips to Target in the beginning of her husband's presidency, and she used a baseball cap to help her go incognito, but she recalled how one time she thought her disguise was not enough. 'The first time I did that I was in an aisle, one woman walked up to me and she tapped me on the shoulder, and I thought, ""Okay, she's seen me."" And she said, ""Can you reach up there and hand me that detergent?""' Mrs Obama said. Partners in stride: Mrs Obama, seen with her husband on Wednesday as they head to the Medal of Freedom ceremony, said that the President sings on a regular basis . She went on to praise her husband's musical skills, which he has demonstrated at a number of events where he slipped in a few lines of a song. 'It was really sweet. But he sings all the time. Oh, yes, he’s in the bathroom all the time just singing,' she said. 'He is always willing to sing. He’s like, ""You want me to sing now, want me to sing something for you?"" But he has got a good voice.' He may hog the family's musical talent but she said it is very well understood that she is the dancing queen in the Obama household. Tall order: Mrs Obama said that her daughters felt that her appearance on BET's 106 and Park gave her 'street cred', as she is seen waving with hosts Bow Wow and Keshia Chante . 'Without a doubt. He can sing. I can dance. I think that divides the talent evenly across the family tree. We’re all satisfied,' she said. But her husband does have swag. 'I always say my husband has got swag,' she said to applause. 'He’s got a little swag.' Mrs Obama stopped by the television show during a trip to New York on Tuesday and she clearly chose her outfit accordingly by sporting a leather jacket and printed top. Earlier on Tuesday she attended a fundraiser for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee at the Sheraton Hotel in midtown.","Said she later realized wearing did not fit for the 'First Lady'

"Hunting for your charger and a free plug socket could soon be a thing of the past. This is according to two electricians, who have designed the world’s first portable turbine phone charger that lets people charge their mobile phone using wind power alone. In fact, the generator can power up any item that requires a USB charger for power. Scroll down for video . Called Trinity, the device doesn’t quite mimic the shape of your usual wind turbine. Instead, the product folds together into a 12-inch (30 cm) cylinder. It then unfolds into a vertical turbine that be used to charge USB devices. Inside the turbine is a battery that holds 15,000 mAh and a 15-watt generator. To open the blades, you first need to pull out the legs and arrange them in a tripod or flat. This will then enable the blades to catch the wind and spin, generating power. Plugging a USB device into the base of the turbine will then charge it. To close it up, the legs are pushed back in and the blades closed automatically. To open the product you pull out the aluminium legs and arrange them either into a tripod or on a flat surface. At the top of the legs is a turbine with three blades. These capture the wind and spin, providing green energy for a generator that can supply to 15 watts of power. There is also an internal battery that can store energy if you don’t need it right away. The inventors claim when fully-charged the turbine can charge your phone four to six times. Once . the turbine is out of juice you can either charge it using the wind or . plug it into a wall output, although obviously for clean energy purposes . the former is preferred. The . company is currently running a Kickstarter project for funding, and . they hope to be able to launch the portable turbine commercially by the . start of next year.

Mr Henbury, 51, who played an Ewok in Return of the Jedi, as well as his role in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, said he is delighted with the results. He said: 'I suddenly noticed I couldn’t hear very well and in busy rooms I was unable to join in on conversations. Until this point my hearing was fine.' He has been using the Starkey hearing aids, which claim to be the world’s first invisible-in-the-canal instruments, for about a year. 'Nobody even knows I have them in,' said Mr Henbury. 'Once I tell people they are amazed as they can’t even tell. 'I even have to remind myself to take them out at night, they are just fantastic and have made such a difference to my life. 'I couldn’t have anything too complex or big and bulky and I had already been told to rule out any surgery as it would be too risky and difficult. “My height has never really been a huge issue but when I started to experience hearing loss it really began to affect my life and I needed to do something about it. 'It’s ironic as I’m the smallest man in Britain and I’m now wearing the smallest hearing aids available - it’s like they have been designed especially for me!' said Michael. Mr Henbury, who also played an Ewok in Return of the Jedi, said hearing loss had really affected his life . Neil Pottinger from Starkey said: 'Invisible hearing aids have revolutionised the way hearing loss is perceived by millions of people. Hearing aid technology has advanced so much, even if you have a hearing defect nobody even know. For many people these discreet hearing devices are the perfect solution.' Mr Henbury added: 'Without the hearing aids my life would be so different, I would almost definitely have a reduced quality of life and would be unable to hear anything.' Around 2 million people own a hearing aid in the UK, but only 1.4 million people actually use one on a regular basis. Embarrassment of wearing hearing aids is thought to deter some from wearing them.","Harry Potter star Michael Henbury, 51, has a pair of invisible devices that fit inside the ear canal .

"Olivier Giroud's new contract with Arsenal is 'done', according to manager Arsene Wenger. The French striker was reported to have been signed a new deal with the Gunners, and Wenger said on Tuesday that everything is in place barring the formalities. When asked about the situation with Giroud - currently out injured with an ankle problem - Wenger said: 'It is done'. Olivier Giroud has signed a new contract at Arsenal that will keep him in north London until 2018 . Olivier Giroud is currenly recovering from surgery after suffering a broken left tibia against Everton . Wenger added: 'We want stability and to keep the core of our team together. Giroud is an important player here. 'It is agreed. When it is completely done, we will announce it.' Wenger, speaking ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash with Galatasaray, also had a fitness update on Mikel Arteta and Aaron Ramsey. The former has a calf problem and the latter a hamstring strain, and they are expected to miss four weeks each. 'To be generous with time, four weeks. If all goes well, three. Arteta is the same, maybe a bit quicker. It will be after the international break,' he said. Jack Wilshere trained despite hurting his ankle against Tottenham at the weekend, while Theo Walcott is due to return to training next week after the knee injury which ruled him out of the World Cup.

While brands everywhere up their prices to cope with the recession, one company has done the opposite. Clothing firm Omgfashion.co.uk has unveiled a 99p dress  - a long black maxi dress with silver detail that is a classic addition to the summer wardrobe. Many will be excited by the budget offering. After all, there's no denying the dress is a bargain. But it would be wise to remember that such cut-price offerings are often clever marketing stunts to increase traffic - and sales - for a site. The average shopper who visits the site to buy the dress will be faced with a £2.95 postage cost on top of the cost of the dress (taking the total to £3.94) - rising to £5.95 for next day delivery. And most will find it hard to resist snapping up another item or two while they are logged on. Bargain: The 99p summer maxi is a long black dress with plunging sweetheart neckline . What better way to make that postage 'worthwhile' than by buying a few more bits and pieces? Still, with the rest of the items . priced reasonably too, this is not going to stretch the purse-strings of . the budget-conscious fashionista too far. The black full-length dress is a sensible summer buy: classic shape, loosely ruched at the waist with a plunging sweetheart neckline. Silver clasps gather the straps together.

"Vaclav Havel, pictured in 2005, died at his weekend this morning, according to his assistant . Vaclav Havel, who became the first Czech president after leading the bloodless Velvet Revolution against communist rule, died yesterday aged 75. The dissident playwright was instrumental in opening the door to democracy in Eastern Europe by loosening the Soviet grip. Tributes flooded in from world leaders who hailed him as ‘the greatest European of our age’. Havel was invited by Margaret Thatcher to 10 Downing Street  during his first official visit to the UK after the collapse of communism in 1989. As well as steering his country towards freedom, he also oversaw the peaceful 1993 split of Czechoslovakia into two separate countries – the Czech Republic and Slovakia. David Cameron said he was ‘deeply saddened’ at his death. ‘Havel devoted his life to the cause of human freedom,’ said the Prime Minister. ‘For years, communism tried to crush him and to extinguish his voice. But Havel, the playwright and the dissident, could not be silenced. ‘No one of my generation will ever forget those powerful scenes from Wenceslas Square two decades ago. Havel led the Czech people out of tyranny. And he helped bring freedom and democracy to our entire continent. ‘Europe owes Vaclav Havel a profound debt. Today his voice has fallen silent. But his example and the cause to which he devoted his life will live on.’ Thousands of people gather in Venceslaw's Square in Prague as a flag is passed over the crowd of mourners . Soldiers stand guard next to a portrait of Havel, set in his memory at the Prague Castle today . A man takes in the news from a commemorative issue of DNES that was handed out to mourners . Hundreds of candles have been lit this evening in tribute to Havel at Wenceslas Square in Prague this evening . Foreign Secretary William Hague said: ‘Cold War hero, playwright and president. He opened the door to democracy in Eastern Europe and will always be remembered.’ He added: ‘He played a pivotal role in the development of freedom in Europe.’Havel never won the Nobel Peace prize despite being nominated several times for the honour. But he was bestowed with America’s highest civilian award by then President George W. Bush who called him ‘one of liberty’s great heroes’. Revolutionary: Havel waves to massive crowds of demonstrators in Prague's Wenceslas Square in 1989, following the collapse of communism and introduction of a new government . National hero: President Havel and his wife Dagmar wave from the balcony of Prague Castle after Havel was sworn in for a second term as president in 1998 . The former chain smoker, who survived several operations for lung cancer and a burst intestine that nearly killed him, died at his country home north-east of the Czech capital Prague. He had a history of chronic respiratory problems dating back to his years locked in dank communist prisons. In recent public appearances recently he appeared thin and drawn. Born in 1936 to a wealthy family  in Czechoslovakia, he began co-writing plays during his military service in the 1950s. His first  solo play, The Garden Party, was staged in 1963. Respected: Havel in discussion with former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in April 2002 . Rise to power: Pictured in his days as a dissident playwright, Havel, right, jokes with a member of the Polish dissident union 'Solidarity' in June 1989 . A lover of jazz and theatre he famously ridiculed the communist state as ‘Absurdistan’. His revolutionary motto was: ‘Truth and love must prevail over lies and hatred.’ But his works were banned after the 1968 uprising was crushed by a Soviet invasion when tanks rolled into Wenceslas Square.","Former president was a key figure in Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution .

"(CNN) -- ""Breaking Bad's"" Walter White may have cleverly dodged authorities during his career as a drug kingpin, but his action figure hasn't dodged the wrath of a Florida mother. Susan Schrivjer, a mother from Fort Myers, launched a petition in early October to have White -- and other ""Breaking Bad"" action figures -- removed from Toys R Us. As of Monday morning, the Change.org request has received more than 2,000 signatures. In the petition, Schrivjer -- who wrote the appeal under the name ""Susan Myers"" -- gets right to the point. ""Toys R Us is well known around the world for their vast selection of toys for children of all ages,"" she wrote. ""However their decision to sell a Breaking Bad doll, complete with a detachable sack of cash and a bag of meth, alongside children's toys is a dangerous deviation from their family friendly values."" In an interview with CNN affiliate WFTX of Fort Myers, Schrivjer expanded on her thoughts. ""Kids mimic their action figures, if you will,"" she told the station. ""Do you want your child in an orange jumpsuit?"" Signers to her petition agree. ""It's sick that a company would design kids toys that glorify the making of meth. It's just as sick to sell them,"" wrote Jaime Keasler. ""While I support free enterprise and there may be a market for these figures, this is a children's toy store,"" said Monica Tessmer. ""It shouldn't even be a question that this is inappropriate. Not a smart move Toy r Us."" The action figures include White -- the chemistry teacher turned meth lord -- and his assistant, Jesse Pinkman, in hazmat suits, as well as White as his gun-toting alter ego, Heisenberg. It's not ""Breaking Bad"" itself, Schrivjer hastens to add. She says she was a fan of the show. ""I thought the show was great,"" she said. ""It was riveting."" But she draws the line at seeing the characters in Toys R Us. Her goal? ""Just to get those taken off the shelf and put them in an appropriate store."" ""Breaking Bad"" star Bryan Cranston, who played White, responded jokingly to Schrivjer's movement. "" 'Florida mom petitions against Toys 'R Us over Breaking Bad action figures.' I'm so mad, I'm burning my Florida Mom action figure in protest,"" he tweeted. Toys R Us has yet to respond to a CNN query. In a statement to WFTX, the toy giant said, ""The products you reference are carried in very limited quantities and the product packaging clearly notes that the items are intended for ages 15 and up. Items from this TV series are located in the adult action figure area of our stores.""","NEW: Bryan Cranston tweets response to controversy .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- The family of an Indian woman who died after a savage gang rape would like to see a new hospital, named after her, to keep her memory alive. Her brother told CNN by phone from eastern India on Sunday that the family's home village, located in a backward region, still doesn't have a well-equipped health care center. ""It will be really good if our village gets a hospital in her name. That will keep her memory alive and serve a cause,"" said the 20-year-old, who asked not to be named. The young man referred to the victim as ""Didi"" -- Hindi for elder sister. ""Didi loved watching movies,"" he said. ""Talaash,"" meaning ""search"" in Hindi and Urdu, was the last Bollywood film they saw together, on a laptop in New Delhi. The rape victim was the eldest of three siblings, with two younger brothers. A physiotherapy student, she was expecting an internship at a hospital in the Indian capital in January. ""After her internship, she would have got a job. And that would have been a great help to our family,"" said the brother, himself a student. He described his sister as both soft and stern. ""Didi was cheerful. But she would also scold me if I didn't score well in exams. She would correct me if I made any mistakes in studies,"" the brother recounted. The family was still struggling with the traumatic loss, he said. ""My mother is trying to normalize. But my father often breaks down. Her memories haunt us. It's more difficult at night,"" he said. The family also regrets that help came too late when the victim was lying injured along a street after the vicious sexual assault on her on the night of December 16. ""That's the problem in our country. People don't come up quickly to help the injured people or accident victims. Mindsets have to change,"" said the victim's brother. Nonetheless, he felt the protests that the attack sparked were justified. ""You need these protests to bring about a change in laws. And laws should be made so tough that nobody should even think of committing such crimes. Rapists deserve death sentence,"" he said.","A new hospital would keep the victim's memory alive and serve a purpose, her brother says .

"Geely pledges to retain group's 107 staff and factory in Coventry . By . Matt Blake . PUBLISHED: . 09:34 EST, 1 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:38 EST, 1 February 2013 . It can be hard enough to make a London black cab driver take you south of the river, but it now turns out they are more than willing to go East. The firm that manufactures the distinctive London taxi, has been saved from the brink of extinction by a company in China, in a deal worth £11 million. Coventry-based Manganese Bronze was today acquired by Chinese private car maker Geely, which owned a 20 per cent stake in the firm before it collapsed into administration last October. Manganese hit the wall after recalling 500 black cabs due to a steering box fault, which came on top of mounting losses at the group. Distinctive: The firm that manufactures the distinctive London taxi, have been bought out of administration by a company in China, in a deal worth £11 million . Geely pledged to retain the group's 107 staff and existing manufacturing site in Coventry. But 156 jobs have already been axed since Manganese called in administrators. The deal was welcomed by Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London. He said: 'I am delighted that Geely has successfully secured the future of the London Taxi Company, ensuring the continuing manufacture of a world famous, fully accessible and instantly recognisable vehicle synonymous with London.' Saved: Manganese Bronze, whose factory is in Coventry, has been acquired by Chinese private automaker Geely . Jobs secured: The group's London Taxi Company division makes about 2,700 cabs a year and has produced more than 100,000 since it started in 1948 . Hard times: 156 jobs have already been axed since Manganese called in administrators in October . The group said it hopes to resume production as soon as possible following the deal. Geely said it was 'confident' of being able to create new jobs and plans new taxi models with improved energy efficiency, while it is also looking at launching into the private hire market. Li Shufu, chairman of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, said the firm has 'ambitious plans' for the business. Trouble brewing: Manganese, which traces its roots back to the 19th century as a maker of ship propellers, was thrown into turmoil last autumn when it discovered a defect with new steering boxes in its TX4 models . 'Despite its recent difficulties, we have long believed that the company and the 'black cab' have huge potential,' he added. Manganese, which traces its roots back to the 19th century as a maker of ship propellers, was thrown into turmoil last autumn when it discovered a defect with new steering boxes in its TX4 models, which were introduced in production at its Coventry factory late last February. Chinese cabs: Geely's new taxi design is unveiled in China last November. While the holding company will be known as Geely UK, the new owner said it will retain the London Taxi International brand . Confident: Geely said it was 'confident' of being able to create new jobs and plans new taxi models with improved energy efficiency, while it is also looking at launching into the private hire market . The group was forced to suspend production and repair and replace all affected models, but said all the cabs which were recalled are now fixed and back on the road. Its London Taxi arm was already suffering amid a consumer spending slowdown and increased rivalry from competitors, such as Eco City vehicles, and Manganese had been loss-making for the past four years. The group's London Taxi Company division makes about 2,700 cabs a year and has produced more than 100,000 since it started in 1948. Its newest model, the TX4, was launched in October 2006. Following today's takeover, Geely chief financial officer Daniel Li will become chairman of the Geely UK and Peter Johansen, formerly group finance director of Manganese Bronze, will be appointed executive vice president of the Black Cab operation. While the holding company will be known as Geely UK, the new owner said it will retain the London Taxi International brand.","Coventry-based Manganese Bronze bought by Chinese automaker Geely .

"By . Ashley Collman . Nearly three months after his death in a fiery car crash, Paul Walker's will is finally being settled. Today, a judge in Santa Barbara court appointed the actor's father, Paul Walker Sr, as executor of his estate - just as Walker detailed in his will. Also in the will was Walker's wish that 15-year-old daughter Meadow be raised by his mother, Cheryl Walker. After the crash: Paul Walker's father, Paul Walker Sr (right),  was named executor of the late actor's estate in Santa Barabara court Thursday. The actor (left) died in a fiery car crash at the end of November . Tragic end: Walker, who became famous for his role in the Fast & Furious franchise, was in the passenger seat of a red Porsche when his friend lost control of the car and crashed . Walker's entire family was in court today, including Meadow and her mother Rebecca Soteros, but a decision has not yet been made on who will be the teen's guardian. For now, she is living with her grandmother. Left behind: Walker had just recently reconnected with his 15-year-old daughter Meadow (right), who came to live with him in Southern California in 2011 after spending most of her life with her mother in Hawaii . While it seems unconventional that Meadow would be raised by her grandmother instead of her mother in Hawaii, both the teen and her mom are reportedly OK with the set-up since Meadow wants to continue living in California. The actor, who became famous for his role in the Fast and Furious series, died at the end of November while riding in a red Prosche with his friend in Santa Clarita, California. Walker was in the passenger seat when friend Roger Rodas lost control of the vehicle and crashed. The early death was made even more tragic by the fact that Walker had just recently reconnected with his daughter. Walker had been mostly absent from Meadow's life as she grew up with her mother Rebecca Soteros in Hawaii. In 2011, Meadow moved to California to live with her father. That move had a profound affect on Walker in the final years of his life. 'She's the best partner I've ever had,' Walker told Entertainment Weekly last year. 'I've never had anything like this in my life. I've been so transient; I've been on my own since I was 16. There's a part of me who feels like I'm making up for lost time.' As evidence for how much he loved his daughter, Walker left his entire $25million fortune to Meadow in his will.

"(CNN) -- They've been man's best friend since the beginning of time. And now, thanks to modern technology, two best friends are together again. When Giuseppe DiBella's beloved 6-month-old puppy Nika disappeared from his home in Newburgh, New York, he immediately plastered countless fliers around town showing pictures of Nika as well as the toy fox terrier's microchip number. But no luck ... time ticked on, and two years passed. While DiBella may have been devastated, he says he ""never gave up."" In mid-September, the 3-pound pooch showed up at the front door of a home in Ocala, Florida, more than 1,000 miles away. A neighbor brought the wayward dog to the animal clinic where she worked and had her scanned for a microchip. That microchip led Marion County Animal Services to DiBella, and they emailed him with the news he'd been hoping for. ""I was so surprised when I realized it was in Florida,"" said DiBella. ""I didn't even know where Marion County was."" DiBella made the trek to Florida this week to pick Nika up from a family friend who has been caring for her.

"The ex-husband and close friend of an injured Sydney cafe siege hostage has told how she was used as a 'human shield' by the gunman just before the crisis came to a bloody end. Louisa Hope, 50, originally from Moruya on the far south coast of New South Wales, and her mother, Robyn, were having coffee at the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place on Monday morning. Self-styled Sheikh Man Haron Monis stormed in around 9:30, withdrawing a pump-action shotgun and holding customers hostage for more than sixteen hours. Ms Hope's ex-husband, who preferred to go by the name Tony V, told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday morning that his former partner was injured during the last moments of the siege. Scroll down for video . Injured hostage: Louisa Hope, 50, was held hostage by the self-styled Sheikh . Robyn Hope, the mother of Louisa, was also held hostage in the Lindt cafe . Louisa Hope - who featured in a hostage video - is pictured here being stretchered out of the Lindt Cafe . 'He'd used her for a human shield for most of the time that she was in there,' said the ex-husband, who used to live in Bondi but now runs a restaurant in South Yorkshire in the United Kingdom. 'That was just before the young lad was shot when he went to take the gun off the gunman.' The dramatic siege - considered a terrorist event according to New South Wales Police Force protocols - came to an end around 2am on Tuesday morning when hostages attempted a mass escape and cafe manager Tori Johnson attempted to grab Monis' weapon. Monis was falling asleep but woke up as the escape was underway.  'He [Monis] had dozed off. He was falling asleep,' Tony said. Hero: Tori Johnson, the manager of the Lindt cafe, tried to seize the gunman's weapon as the hostages frantically tried to escape . 'Some rustling noises had woke him when the lad was trying to take the gun off him. 'That's when [Johnson] was shot. Apparently that's when my ex-mother-in-law [Robyn] was then shot in the shoulder and that's when the police then went in... and that's when Louisa was shot in the foot.' Two people - Johnson and barrister and mum-of-three Katrina Dawson - were killed and at least four people were injured and taken to hospital. Ms Hope's ex-partner, who spoke to family on Tuesday morning UK time, said the whole incident had been 'very frightening'. He had some words of support for his injured friend, who he said has been operated on and is recovering in hospital. 'I'd just give her a hug and just tell her to keep strong,' Tony said.

A cancer doctor accused of plotting to kill his ex-wife's divorce lawyer said he wanted a picture of the attorney with a 'bullet between his eyes', a court heard. Police said a video showed Mississippi oncologist Ralph Arnold Smith Jr, 70, making the request of an alleged hitman. The lawyer was unhurt, however, because state agents were tipped off to the possible £20,000 murder-for-hire plot and were waiting at his office when the hitman arrived. Accused: Oncologist Ralph Arnold Smith Jr is said to have plotted to kill his ex-wife's divorce lawyer . Alleged assassin Keaira Byrd, 23, who was wearing a black ski mask, was killed in a shootout and his associate was severely wounded. Smith, 70, is charged with conspiring to kill attorney Lee Abraham, who represented his ex-wife. Records for the divorce were sealed in 2005, but docket entries show the couple fought over money long after it was granted in 1998. At a preliminary hearing at Leflore County Court yesterday, Greenwood police detective Jeff Byars said that the doctor kept a hidden camera in his office. Tearful: Smith's daughters, from left, Jennifer Welch, Victoria Smith and Kimie Smith, broke down after the case was sent to be heard by a grand jury . Distraught: The women sobbed as prosecutors outlined the case against their father . A video from the camera showed Smith telling Byrd that he wanted a photo showing Abraham dead, the policeman added. 'Take a picture of him with a bullet between his eyes,' Byars said in describing the video. The men’s faces were not visible on the video, and some of it was inaudible. Grin: Smith Jr smiles across the courtroom . Byars said that Bird was carrying a semi-automatic pistol with a 30-round clip when he walked into the lawyer’s office on April 28. It is not clear whether Byrd or the investigators fired first. Byrd’s associate, Derrick Lacy, 25, was shot several times in the back and in the leg. A bullet grazed an investigator. Lacy has been released on house arrest while he recovers. He is charged with capital murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Smith, with greying hair, white beard and glasses, sat with his legs crossed during the hearing with a brown envelope and his hands clasped on his lap. He shook his head from side to side when it was suggested he had hired someone to kill Abraham. Byars said a police investigation discovered a list of possible hit men and where they could be found. Onlookers gasped as names were read out. County Judge Kevin Adams decided there was enough evidence to send the case to a grand jury. The judge ordered the doctor to be held without bond on the capital murder charge and on a conspiracy to commit murder charge. Shootout: Greenwood Police Detective Sgt Jeff Byars shows the court a crime scene photograph of alleged hitman Keaira Byrd, lying dead on the floor of Abraham's office . Lethal: Byrd was carrying a semi-automatic pistol with a 30-round clip when he walked into Abraham's office, Byars said . Smith’s bond remained $100,000 on a second conspiracy to commit murder charge. The two conspiracy charges are both related to plots to kill Abraham, but involve different men the doctor approached to help carry out the plan, according to testimony. Cordarious Robinson, 22, is charged in the second conspiracy count. Authorities said Smith paid Robinson $15,000 for two guns and to 'put his ear to the ground to find someone to take out Lee Abraham'. It is not clear if Robinson enlisted Byrd, but authorities said the two men met on the day of the shooting. Smith’s relatives wept when the judge said he would remain in jail. Mississippi Bureau of Investigation agent Mark Steed said there was evidence that a plot against Abraham went back as far as two years.

According to an article in the New York Times, the CEO  'balked' at the idea of hiring the Hollywood actress because she 'disapproved of the fact that Paltrow did not graduate college'. The lengthy piece revealed that former Google executive Mayer, who had been drafted in to remake the once-great Yahoo, 'habitually asked deputies where they attended college'.

The decision has been questioned by critics who label Mayer as 'a higher education snob' and point out that internet greats Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of Reed, Harvard, and Harvard respectively. Mayer, who graduated Stanford in 1997, was just 38 when she was hired by Yahoo in 2012 in a bid to turn around the fortunes of the floundering California-based internet corporation.

"By . James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 18:11 EST, 24 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:41 EST, 25 October 2012 . Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith will today call for more welfare changes . Jobless couples with more than two children should have benefit payments limited, Iain Duncan Smith suggested yesterday. The Work and Pensions Secretary said there were ‘large numbers’ of couples on welfare having big families – unlike middle-income parents who had to weigh up if they could afford to have another child. Mr Duncan Smith condemned the ‘madness’ of the state subsidising large workless families – saying it would be fairer to the ‘vast majority’ of responsible taxpayers if benefits were limited to the first two children in future. He has agreed to find another £10billion in welfare savings by 2016, having already slashed £18billion from a vast budget that grew by 60 per cent under Labour. As well as cuts to child benefit and tax credits for large workless families, he suggested housing benefit could be stripped for those who expected to go straight from school on to welfare and a state-subsidised house. Liberal Democrat sources, however, warned nothing had been agreed and suggested the proposals were ‘just Tory kite-flying’. A senior Lib Dem source said: ‘It doesn’t even save very much money as we’ve already introduced a benefits cap.’ But Mr Duncan Smith said more reforms were vital as the Government sought to control public finances. He dismissed suggestions the Coalition was ‘hurting’ claimants – insisting the real cruelty was leaving people languishing on welfare for years. ‘We have accepted for far too long in this country that it is possible for people to just stay on benefits,’ he said. ‘It is all about saying, we will give you massive support to find work... But also, we have an expectation, as the taxpayer pays for these bills, that you try your hardest to find work.’ Most controversially, Mr Duncan Smith . suggested the present system encouraged poorer families to have large . numbers of children without worrying about the cost. 'An end to never-ending benefits': The Government plans to restrict housing benefit to the under-25s . ‘When you look at families across the . board, at all incomes, you find the vast, vast majority make decisions . about the kind of numbers of children they have, the families they want, . based on what they think they can afford,’ he said. ‘Where you see the clustering of the . large families is really down at the very lowest incomes, those on . significant levels of welfare, and those on the very top incomes. In . other words, the problem for those who are paying the taxes, paying the . bills – they make the decisions about their lives, even if they . sometimes would like to maybe have extra children, they make decisions. ‘People who are having support through . welfare are often free from that decision. We want to support people if . they have children when they are out of work, of course. ‘But can there not be a limit to the . fact that really you need to remember you need to cut your cloth in . accordance with what capabilities and what finances you have?’ In his speech to the Cambridge Public . Policy think-tank, he suggested only welfare claimants having children . in future would be affected, not existing families. Alison Garnham, of the Child Poverty . Action Group, said: ‘When parents plan their families they’re not . thinking about whether at some point in future they might be on . benefit.’ Liam Byrne, Labour’s work and pensions spokesman, said: ‘The truth is it’s working people who are seeing their help axed.’","Iain Duncan Smith to call for further changes to the welfare system .

"Chick-fil-A says it's removing high-fructose corn syrup from its white buns and artificial dyes from its sauces and dressings as part of a push to improve its ingredients. The fast-food chicken chain says the reformulated buns are being tested in about 200 Georgia locations, while the sauces and dressings will be tested starting early next year. It says it also removed a yellow dye from its chicken soup and that the new recipe should be in all restaurants by the end of this month. Chick-fil-A says it's removing high-fructose corn syrup from its white buns and artificial dyes from its sauces and dressings . Bye-bye yellow dye: A new soup will be available at Chick-Fil-A by the end of this month . It's also testing a new peanut oil, with hopes of a rollout early next year. The changes come after blogger Vani Hari wrote a post in 2011 titled 'Chick-fil-A or Chemical Fil-A?' on her site, FoodBabe.com. It noted that the chain's sandwich had nearly 100 ingredients, including peanut oil with TBHQ, a chemical made from butane. Hari, based in Charlotte, N.C., continued writing about Chick-fil-A's ingredients. Then last year, the company invited her to its headquarters to spend the day talking with executives. 'They took my concerns and started developing a road map of how to address them,' Hari said. On Wednesday, she said she was notified about the changes in an email from the company. Ingredients in packaged and fast foods . are coming under greater scrutiny as more people look to stick to diets . they feel are natural. Last year, for instance, PepsiCo Inc. said it . would remove a controversial ingredient from Gatorade in response to . customer demand, and Kraft Foods recently confirmed to the AP that it . was reformulating select varieties of its macaroni and cheese to remove . artificial dyes. Vani Hari met with Chick-Fil-A execs to discuss menu changes for the year 2014 . Vani Hari sparked controversy when she published information on her site saying that Cick-Fil-A sandwiches were partially  made from butane . Still, companies typically don't like publicizing such changes because it could bring unwanted attention over other ingredients or other products. Chick-fil-A, for instance, hasn't made any announcements about its recently reformulated products. Jodie Worrell, who works in Chick-fil-A product strategy and development, confirmed the changes in an interview and said the company has been working on improving the ingredients in its foods for several years, starting with the removal of trans fats. High-fructose corn syrup was also recently removed from other dressings. 'We've been systemically going through (the menu),' she said. David Farmer, vice president of product strategy and development, noted that Chick-fil-A would likely keep making changes. 'More and more these days, we've become a kind of food culture. People seem to care a lot more about what's in it, how it's made and where did it come from,' he said.

"By . Jill Reilly . Dozens of people are feared dead following an explosion in north-eastern Nigeria, with Boko Haram militants believed to be behind the attack. The attack took place last night after a village football competition in the town of Mubi in Adamawa state. It is one of the three states under a year-old emergency rule imposed by President Goodluck Jonathan to fight Boko Haram, which seeks to impose Islamic rule in Nigeria. The attack took place last night near a primary school where there are also a number of beer halls in the town of Mubi in Adamawa state . Othman Abubakar, a spokesman for the Adamawa state police, confirmed the explosion but he could not say how many people had been killed or injured. David Dauda, who witnessed the blast, said he saw at least 30 bodies following the explosion. 'The blast occurred shortly after people are dispersing from a football playing ground,' he said. 'People gathered there to watch a football competition and just few minutes after soldiers patrol vehicle left the place then we heard a blast.' The explosion occurred at around 6.45pm local time when many people were headed home to make a 7.00pm curfew imposed in the wake of earlier attacks. Nigeria's north-eastern region has suffered five years of increasingly deadly assaults by Boko Haram, whose fighters have targeted towns and villages in a string of bomb and gun attacks. At least 2,000 civilians have been killed in such attacks this year alone. Boko Haram has claimed responsibility for kidnapping more than 300 schoolgirls in the town of Chibok on April 15. The 250 girls are being held by Islamic group Boko Haram after they were abducted from Chibok, in north eastern Nigeria . Fifty seven girls are believed to have escaped, which leaves an estimated 272 still held captive. In another attack yesterday evening, also in Adamawa state, suspected Boko Haram members opened fire at people indiscriminately around the town of Madagali, according to witnesses. Boko Haram terrorists took more than 250 girls in a raid on their school in Chibok, in Nigeria’s north-east, on April 14. At the weekend a heartbreaking new video of the Nigerian schoolgirls shows them bravely speaking out about their ordeal for the . first time. The . footage, not released publicly but seen by The Mail on Sunday, was . taken in a jungle clearing a month after their abduction. The video, taken by an intermediary on . May 19, has been shown to President Goodluck Jonathan. It was intended . to serve as ‘proof of life’ for the girls and to encourage the President . to accede to the terrorists’ demands.

"By . Jaya Narain and James Tozer . PUBLISHED: . 20:38 EST, 28 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:38 EST, 28 November 2012 . A decision not to prosecute Cyril Smith in the 1960s over allegations of sexual abuse left him free to prey on other children, it was claimed yesterday. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) admits it should have prosecuted the politician over accusations of abuse towards the end of the 60s. But fresh claims emerged yesterday that the 29-stone MP sexually abused boys at a second children’s home as late as 1980. Horrific: Chris Marshall, right, said he was just seven or eight when he was sexually abused by Cyril Smith, left, at a notorious school for vulnerable boys . Chris Marshall said he was just seven or eight when he was sexually abused by Smith at a notorious school for vulnerable boys. Mr Marshall, now 40, moved into Knowl View in Rochdale in 1979. Just months later, he says, he was forced to perform a sex act on Smith – known to the pupils as ‘the fat man’ – after being ‘summoned’ from his dormitory in the dead of night. He said: ‘A member of staff came up and took me from the room. He took me into this flat. The fat man was on the bed and another kid was there too. ‘We were told to go back afterwards to our rooms, not to wake anybody else up and have a good breakfast in the morning. ‘It was a dreadful, dreadful experience but I was so confused I didn’t tell anyone until much later. But the school was rife with this type of behaviour and there were all sorts of sexual things going on.’ After the abuse, he begged staff for his own room. When he got his wish, he slept with a chair against the door so no-one could get in. Request: Simon Danczuk, Labour MP for Rochdale, said it would be 'helpful' if Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, pictured, withdrew the tribute he paid to Smith on his death in 2010 . Mr Marshall said that it was only when he was in his teens and saw photos of the high-profile politician in a newspaper that he realised who his abuser was. He said: ‘It was definitely Cyril Smith. The truth is he was a child abuser and targeted vulnerable children. People need to know this is what he was – he was a paedophile.’ Mr Marshall has since made a complaint to police and hopes his actions will encourage other victims to come forward. A social worker blew the whistle on the behaviour at Knowl View – which closed in 1992 – and police launched an investigation. In September 2002, David Higgins, a former teacher, pleaded guilty to 11 counts of indecent assault and gross indecency. Smith, who was a Liberal then Liberal Democrat MP from 1972-92, was a governor at the troubled school though he was not looked at as part of those probes. On Tuesday the CPS admitted Smith, who was a Labour councillor in the 1950s and 60s, should have been charged with sex crimes more than 40 years ago. Instead, in March 1970, the Director of Prosecution, Norman Skelhorn, wrote to Lancashire Police saying he would not advise prosecution. The CPS said procedural changes meant a prosecution would have been pursued today. Simon Danczuk, Labour MP for Rochdale, said: ‘I am confident in saying, having met a number of the victims, that he went on to abuse into the 70s, 80s and even into the 90s, so he was empowered by the fact that he hadn’t been prosecuted.’ Mr Danczuk added that it would be ‘helpful’ if Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg withdrew the tribute he paid to Smith on his death in 2010. Mr Clegg said at the time: ‘Cyril Smith was a larger-than-life character and one of the most recognisable and likeable politicians of his day. Everybody in Rochdale knew him, not only as their MP but also as a friend.’ Last night a Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘Nick Clegg, like the whole of the party, is horrified by these allegations. Clearly, if he had been aware of them, he would not have made previous positive comments about Cyril Smith and strongly disassociates himself from them.’ Yesterday it emerged former prime minister Tony Blair’s personal priest will be questioned by police over Knowl View. In 2007, Father Michael Seed, 55, wrote a book, in which he detailed sexual abuse in the school where he had been a pupil. He was unavailable for comment last night.","Chris Marshall said he was just seven or eight when he was sexually abused by Smith at a notorious school for vulnerable boys .

"(CNN) -- Katy Perry is football's newest favorite pop star. After attending her first college football game on October 4 (Ole Miss vs. Alabama), appearing on ESPN's ""College GameDay"" and sending a flirtatious message to Oklahoma Sooners quarterback Trevor Knight, pretty much the only thing left for Perry to do is take the field herself. According to reports, Perry will come close to doing just that as the star of 2015's Super Bowl halftime show. Katy Perry reportedly to perform at Super Bowl XLIX halftime . Neither Perry nor the NFL has commented on the speculation, and the singer herself seemed to downplay the idea during her appearance on ""College GameDay."" ""I'm not the kind of girl who would pay to play the Super Bowl,"" Perry said, referring to an August Wall Street Journal report suggesting that Perry, Rihanna and Coldplay were three of the acts in consideration for the opportunity but that the NFL was requesting they pay to take the stage. The Journal noted that the request was met with a ""chilly"" response, as indicated by Perry's comment last week. But by Friday, it seems someone's tune changed, with the New York Post's Page Six and Billboard reporting that Perry is preparing to shine at Super Bowl XLIX, set for February 1 in Glendale, Arizona. It's not hard to see why the NFL would want to pursue Perry; if her much-talked-about performance happens, these are three reasons why we think she'd kill it. 1. She's got energetic, exuberant pop. Katy Perry's music is essentially the stuff Super Bowl halftime dreams are made of. Much of her catalog is high-energy, danceable pop that's just cheeky enough to be entertaining without losing a sponsorship. And she has a backlog of hits to choose from: There's ""Birthday"" and ""Roar"" from her 2013 release ""Prism,"" plus older but still-in-rotation tracks like ""Firework,"" ""Peacock,"" ""California Gurls"" and ""I Kissed A Girl."" 2. Everyone from your grandma to your 3-year-old nephew knows her music. In 2011, Katy Perry tied with Michael Jackson -- not bad company -- with five No. 1 singles from the same album. You don't accomplish that without some serious fan power, young and old. And when we say young, we mean young: ""Dark Horse"" has been known to soothe at least one baby. 3. She gives a show-stopping performance. One of the things critics took away from Perry's 2012 concert documentary, ""Part of Me,"" is that just much work goes into a Perry performance. From the costumes to the set pieces, Perry creates her own whimsical wonderland -- as anyone who's seen one of her videos can attest. We can only imagine the kind of creation that would accompany a Super Bowl halftime show.","Katy Perry is reportedly performing at the 2015 Super Bowl halftime show .

"Almost half of adults overestimate how big their waists can get before it potentially has an impact on their hearts, a survey has found. Medical opinion is that women are at increased risk of heart disease if their waist strays over 32 inches, while men should not exceed 37 inches. However, over 40 per cent of respondents thought their bellies had to be bigger to do any harm, and 20 per cent thought they could get away with a waist size of 40 inches for men and 35 inches for women. Scroll down for video . Almost half of adults overestimate how big their waists can get before it may have an impact on their hearts . The figures in the online YouGov poll relate to 46 per cent of men and 43 per cent of women. Overall, fewer than half of adults (42 per cent) were aware of the threshold for high blood pressure (a reading of 140/90) which can increase the risk of heart attack and stroke, and almost half of adults (46 per cent) didn’t know what a healthy Body Mass Index is. Body Mass Index is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in metres squared. A healthy BMI is between 18.5 and 25. The survey also found that more than a third of people (34 per cent) underestimated how much exercise they should be doing a week. Only 15 per cent knew that adults are advised to do 30 minutes of exercise, five times a week to maintain a healthy heart yet. The charity says the findings, published to coincide with World Heart Day, mean that millions of people are putting the health of their heart at risk because they are not taking the necessary steps to prevent heart disease. Heart disease ranks bottom of the list of health concerns for most people even though it is the UK’s single biggest killer claiming 73,000 lives a year. Just two per cent of Britons are afraid of developing the condition, according to the poll of over 2,000 people for the British Heart Foundation. This compares with 33 per cent who worry about developing dementia, 29 per cent who are afraid of cancer, nine per cent who dread Motor Neurone Disease and six per cent who fear a stroke. Just two per cent of Britons are afraid of developing heart disease, according to a British heart Foundation poll . The only conditions to rank alongside heart disease are Parkinson’s and the Ebola virus. Furthermore, although most people are aware of the risk factors for developing heart disease, such as high blood pressure, being overweight, a sedentary lifestyle and poor diet, they don’t actually know what this means. It also raises the question why despite huge awareness campaigns for heart disease, the messages are not getting through. Dr Mike Knapton, Associate Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘Your heart is the most vital organ in your body, but all too often we take it for granted. ‘Despite being a largely preventable condition, coronary heart disease is still the UK’s single biggest killer, causing unnecessary heartache for thousands of families. 'By taking control of your heart health, you can invest in and enjoy your future health and life.’ Maureen Talbot, a Senior Cardiac Nurse at the charity, added: ‘There are still people out there that think heart disease will never happen to them and are shocked when it does. ‘Showing the benefits of reducing risk factors is quite a slow process and although things have improved, it is not always obvious. There is always more than can be done to get the right message out at the right time.’","Women at increased risk of heart disease if their waist strays over 32 inches .

"A Texas man landed in jail after trying to pull a prank on tax collectors involving a stack of tightly folded dollar bills. Timothy Norris, 27, from Wichita Falls, was arrested January 28 after refusing to leave the county tax office while attempting to pay his property tax using several hundred extremely creased banknotes. An arrest affidavit indicates the smart-aleck debtor was asked by tax collector Tommy Smyth to leave the Wichita County building for disrupting the operations of the office. Tightfisted: Timothy Norris, 27, was arrested and charged with criminal trespass and resisting arrest after he brought 600 tightly folded $1 banknotes to pay his property tax bill . The incident took place at around 2pm at the Wichita County Courthouse Annex on Scott Street. Norris was attempting to pay his $600 tax bill using $1 bills folded so tightly it took personnel about six minutes to unfold each banknote, according to the affidavit obtained by Times Record News. The document states the situation turned physical when Norris pulled away twice from a deputy who was attempting to place him in handcuffs.

"A Russian university is planning to create a 'Noah's Ark' consisting of the frozen DNA of every creature that has ever lived. Moscow State University has received the country's largest-ever scientific grant to embark on the project, which is scheduled to be completed by 2018 and will be based in a 430sq km site on campus. The institute, which has received 1billion rubles (£12.6million) to help get it off the ground, aims to cryogenically freeze and store cells which are capable of reproducing. The 'Noah's Ark' project aims to collect cellular materials from every creature to have ever lived . Viktor Sadivnichy, the university's rector, likened the gigantic project to a modern-day 'Noah's Ark', RT reported. He explained: 'It will involve the creation of a depository - a databank for the storing of every living thing on Earth, including not only living, but disappearing and distinct organisms. 'It will also contain information systems. If it's realised, this will be a leap in Russian history as the first nation to create an actual Noah's Ark of sorts.' The announcement marks the latest, and most ambitious, of the world's DNA banks which have increased in numbers in the past decade following breakthroughs in technology and growing concern about species extinction. These are known as frozen zoos - the most well known of which is that at San Diego Zoo. Staff at the research centre have sperm, DNA and other animal matter frozen in liquid nitrogen since 1976. It currently holds about 8,400 samples from over 800 species. Britain also maintains the Frozen Ark Project, which is run by a consortium of biological societies, zoos, museums and research facilities. Its website states preserved viable cells will enable biologists to 'reverse the dangerous loss of genetic variation that can cause infertility and early death in breeding programmes'. The enormous DNA database will be held in a building at Moscow University Campus (pictured) It holds a remarkable 28,604 frozen DNA samples, of which more than 7,000 are from species on the 'red list' of endangered animals. This includes the Spiny Lobster, the Channel Islands Fox, the Bonefish, the Indiana Bat and Cat's Paw Coral. But Russia's historic Noah's Ark project is not the first of its kind for the country - a storage facility in the remote Siberian wilderness aims to use the natural cold of Siberia's thick permafrost to preserve seed and plant samples for up to 100 years. At least 1.5million seeds from plants and vegetables will be housed in the cryostorage unit in Yakutsk, protecting many of the world's important foods and endangered plant life against climate change, war, and disaster. There is already a small unit containing 100,000 samples (pictured) on the site, but a new extension will mean many more seeds can be stored .","The world's most ambitious DNA bank will be created at Russian University .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Gunmen shot and killed a Saudi diplomat in Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital, on Tuesday, police said. Bangladesh police said Khalaf Al Ali, 45, had served two years at the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Dhaka as head of citizens' affairs. The Saudi Embassy in Dhaka confirmed the death but declined to make a comment. Ali was shot dead in the city's highly secured Gulshan diplomatic zone in front of his rented apartment at about 1 a.m. Tuesday, and he died at a local hospital about 5 p.m., authorities said. Lutful Kabir, a deputy commissioner of Dhaka's metropolitan police, said no motive for the killing has been found. ""He was shot in the left chest from a close distance,"" he said after an initial investigation. ""We're shocked. ... It's unexpected and unfortunate. ... We'll use all possible means to bring the culprits to book,"" Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Dipu Moni said. ""Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia maintain very good relations, and I believe it will not affect the relations,"" she said. Police said Ali lived alone at his Gulshan apartment and went for a walk late every night. Tapos Rema, a guard at the Saudi official's home, said Ali went for the walk as usual and was attacked when he returned. Witnesses said that when Ali was near his home, shots were fired from a car that then fled. Shamsul Islam, a junior Bangladeshi minister for home affairs, said ""the matter is being investigated, and we'll bring the perpetrators to justice as soon as possible."" Saudi Arabia, where more than 2 million Bangladeshis stay and work, is a key ally and a major donor to Bangladesh. In recent years, Riyadh has tightened recruitment from Bangladesh. In October, Saudi authorities executed eight Bangladeshi workers in public for their alleged involvement in an armed robbery in which an Egyptian security guard was killed. Dhaka criticized the beheadings, as did the United Nations.","Authorities say Khalaf Al Ali, 45, was shot about 1 a.m. Tuesday and died about 5 p.m.

"(CNN)  -- China and Vietnam have settled a lengthy border dispute nearly 30 years after a month-long war that left tens of thousands of people dead, state-run media reported. The settlement of the dispute -- which covered the land border between the two countries -- came during a December 28-31 meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam, Xinhua news agency reported, citing a joint statement issued by the two governments on Wednesday. The deal settled the remaining issues from a 1999 China-Vietnam land boundary treaty. Xinhua called the settlement ""a major event of historical significance"" in relations between the two countries. A ceremony marking the agreement and building of land border markers will be held later, the news agency said. The border dispute arose after China, which supported North Vietnam during the Vietnam War, invaded its southern neighbor in February 1979 -- two months after Vietnam invaded Cambodia and ousted the pro-Beijing Pol Pot regime. The 29-day incursion ended with the last Chinese troops leaving on March 19 -- and without having forced the Vietnamese out of Cambodia. During the next two decades, both sides stationed hundreds of thousands of troops along the border until the 1999 treaty. The two sides are still in disagreement over the Spratly islands, a chain in the South China Sea claimed by Vietnam, China, Taiwan, Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines.","Border dispute arose after a one-month war between China and Vietnam in 1979 .

"A Chicago man has been arrested for abusing his wife after she was found starved, blind and covered in four-inch wide bedsores. Mary Jane Duffy, 60, was discovered alone and suffering by police on August 23, 2011, at the Brookfield, Illinois, home she shared with her husband. Weighing just 56 pounds, the frail 4-foot-11 woman was in the foetal position, covered in ulcers and had severe bruising, fractured bones and missing teeth. Ailing: Mary Jane Duffy, pictured, died just a week after being found weighing just 56 pounds on August 23, 2011 . Her toenails were long and dirty, she was blind and in the last stages of dementia, according to Cook County sheriff's office. She was rushed to Holy Cross Hospital in Chicago where she died a week later on September 1. The woman's husband, Joseph Duffy, 70, was . arrested on Wednesday and charged with two counts of criminal abuse or neglect of a person . with a disability. He faces up to seven years in prison. When the woman was wheeled out of the . home, Mr Duffy told officers that he didn't want her to leave the house . because he would 'lose money', referring to his wife's social security . and pension payments. Healthy: Ms Duffy, pictured in 2000, died of 'spousal neglect' according to Cook County medical examiner's office . Fading away: Hospital and nursing home staff repeatedly warned that Ms Duffy, pictured in 2009, was suffering abuse at the hands of her husband . Mr Duffy was pocketing $3,000 in . benefits every month, which included a disability pension from his . wife's former employer Con Edison, according to the sheriff's office. 'We have not seen any indication of remorse,' Sheriff Thomas Dart said. According to the Cook County medical . examiner's office, Ms Duffy died of bronchopneumonia and 'spousal . neglect'. The office ruled the death a homicide. Abuse: Joseph Duffy, pictured, was charged with felony criminal abuse of a person with a disability, his 60-year-old wife, Mary Jane . The woman also had an underlying . condition called congenital hydrocephalus, or fluid on the brain at . birth, which contributed to her death, the office's report said. Mr Dart told MailOnline that his office had been pushing for murder charges and was disappointed Mr Duffy had only been charged with abuse. 'As far as elder abuse goes, this is the worst case our office has ever handled,' he said. Between 2006 and 2011, Ms Duffy was treated for dementia and other ailments.

"Three babies have been declared HIV-free after being treated with a revolutionary new drug only hours after they were born. The fourth child only has 'a very low level' of the virus after receiving the same treatment. The findings, to be announced at the AIDS 2014 conference in Melbourne from July 20, are a major breakthrough in the fight against AIDS with scientists hoping it could lead to a cure if treatment his received early enough. Four Canadian babies have been cleared of having HIV after being born to HIV-positive mothers, due to being given a high dose of three different antiretroviral drugs . It's not yet known how old the babies are now but more is expected to be released when 14,000 delegates from nearly 200 countries descend on Melbourne to share their research and the latest scientific advances in the field. AIDS 2014 co-chairman, Professor Sharon Lewin, told the Daily Mail Australia that despite some people labelling the results as a 'cure', it can not yet be officially classed as one. 'At the moment, the doctors do not know whether they are in fact cured. The only way they can tell is if they stop the anti-HIV drugs and see if it comes back,' Professor Lewin said. 'We are excited about this though because all four received very early treatment after delivery, and when doctors tried to locate the virus they could find virtually no viruses in their systems. 'These baby cases, and more cases amongst adults, tell us that if we treat HIV very early in some people were able to stop it. News of the four babies and their success stories comes only a year after the very first child to ever be 'cured' of HIV was officially announced. 'And in some people, maybe only 10 per cent or so who start treatment very early, it might even be safe for them to stop taking their drugs and their virus stays under control. However this is still a research question that needs to be addressed.' 'However you must keep in mind that the best way to stop babies getting HIV is to treat the mother during pregnancy,' she added. After contracting the virus from their mothers, the four Canadian-born children were given a high dose of three different antiretroviral drugs. News of the four babies and their success stories comes only a year after the very first child to ever be 'cured' of HIV was officially announced. The baby, born in Mississippi in 2010, and was cleared of any infection in 2013. The mother of the child only found out that she was infected with HIV during her labor and thus was not able to take precautionary action which could help her unborn child avoid infection. The major breakthrough will be discussed amongst a whole range of other new research at the AIDS conference in Melbourne from July 20-25 . According to the University of Mississippi, Dr. Hannah Gay associate professor of pediatrics and a HIV specialist, gave the baby a three-drug antiretroviral therapeutic prescription, beginning the  treatment when she was only 30-hours-old - despite not having confirmation that the baby was infected at the time. Only 29 days later, the virus could not be found in the infant's system and did not return after the child stopped taking her prescription. However the four Canadian children are yet to stop taking their treatment and doctors are unable to determine if the virus is likely to return if they do. In 2009, an American man called Timothy Ray Brown received bone marrow from a donor who was resistant to HIV and was later given the all-clear by a Berlin hospital.","Three Canadian born babies have been declared HIV-free after receiving treatment straight after their births .

However, despite earning the artist a fortune, Ms Pon said she was paid a tiny sum to sit for Tretchikoff and made nothing from its huge sales. Scroll down for video . The Chinese Girl made artist Vladimir Tretchikoff very rich and was one of the most popular paintings of the 20th Century but Monika Pon, right, said she made no money from its enormous popularity . Her face has appeared on everything from mugs to wallpaper, as well as various pieces of Chinese Girl paraphernalia. The South African, whose parents emigrated from China, told The Observer said: 'I've got no money from the painting. 'I was so stupid, so young. What did I know about business.' Tretchikoff approached Ms Pon, who lives in Johannesburg, when she was 17 and working in her uncle’s laundry in Cape Town in the early 1950s. He told Ms Pon, who was known locally for her beauty, that he wanted to paint her and despite being nervous, she said she felt she could not say no. He gave her £6 for six weeks of sittings in front of his art students. The original artwork was sold to a woman in Chicago and Tretchikoff claimed to have sold half a million large-format reproductions of the painting across the world. Ms Pon, who is now in her 80s, was only revealed to be the Green Lady in 2011. She recalled how she was told she was beautiful by friends and family but never felt pretty because, living in Apartheid-era South Africa, she was often subjected to racist remarks. She described Tretchikoff, who died in 2006, as 'handsome and attractive' and that he made her laugh. She enjoyed sitting for him but was less than happy with the end result. Ms Pon said in 2011: 'To be honest, I didn’t like that green face. I thought it made me look ill.’ She went on to marry and divorce commercial traveller Pon Su-Suan and have five children. She has been with the same partner for the past 40 years. Monika Sing-Lee, 17, was renowned for her beauty and Vladimir Tretchikoff asked her to sit for him . Meanwhile . Tretchikoff made millions selling cheap reproductions of his work directly to the public and although he was loathed by the critics, his art remained perennially popular. While . acknowledging he painted an early version of the picture in Cape Town, . Tretchikoff claimed it had been destroyed by vandals and maintained . until his death in 2006 that his model came from the U.S. Experts think that he concealed its true origin through misguided fear of being sued for a portion of its earnings. She said in 2011 : ‘I’m not boasting but it was my portrait that made Tretchikoff . rich. The Chinese Girl was the best thing that ever happened to me in my . not-so-nice life.’ The painting will be auctioned at Bonhams in London in March by the original buyer's granddaughter. It is also touring New York and Johannesburg. In his autobiography Pigeon's Luck, Tretchikoff wrote: 'In painting Chinese Girl I had a lot of experience to . draw on. My mind and soul went into this painting, and perhaps there . lies the explanation for its success. Somehow perhaps I caught the . essence of Chinese womanhood.' Giles Peppiatt, director of South . African Art at Bonhams, said: 'The iridescent hues of Chinese . Girl reflect Tretchikoff's experimentation with the possibilities of . his colour palette: the green-blue patina-like effect of the sitter's . face is uncanny, heightening the red of her lips and framed by her . lustrous dark hair.' Tretchikoff biographer Boris Gorelik said the painting is 'one of the most important pop culture icons in Britain and the Commonwealth in the 1950s to early 1960s. 'Today, even prints of the ""Green Lady"" in mint condition, which went for a couple of pounds in . their day, change hands for hundreds of pounds.'","Monika Pon said she was given £6 for six weeks of sittings in Johannesburg .
Millions of prints of the painting, also known as the Green Lady, were sold .

"By . Harriet Arkell . PUBLISHED: . 11:53 EST, 10 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 13:54 EST, 10 February 2014 . A Belfast-born convert to Islam who planned to shoot Prince Harry dead has been jailed after admitting making a threat to kill. Ashraf Islam, 31, who was formerly known as Mark Townley, had wanted to kill the fourth in line to the throne, whom he believed 'had blood on his hands' after taking part in two tours of Afghanistan, by disarming a bodyguard and using his gun to shoot Harry. Today he was jailed for three years after the judge at Isleworth Crown Court in west London described Islam’s plot as 'vague and unlikely to succeed', but said he presented a risk to the public. Ashraf Islam, 31, who was Mark Townley, left, before he converted to Islam, was jailed today for three years after telling police he was plotting to kill Prince Harry, whom he thought had 'blood on his hands' as a soldier . Islam, of no fixed address but who had been living in west London, had handed himself in to police in May last year the day after drummer Lee Rigby was killed in Woolwich. His barrister, Roxanne Morrell, told the judge that Islam had given himself up and volunteered information about his plot. Judge Richard McGregor-Johnson, the recorder for Kensington and Chelsea, said he would not go over details of Islam’s plot, but he told Islam during the brief hearing: 'This was not a threat made in isolation. 'The examination of your computer revealed you conducted research on his [Prince Harry’s] whereabouts and intentions. 'You had given the matter considerable thought.' He added: 'The reason behind that is that you thought he and other serving officers had some moral guilt, and you thought you had a moral right to judge. 'I accept that there is nothing here that could be described as professional plans as to your expressed intentions. 'Your plan was vague and unlikely to succeed.' Islam intended to shoot Prince Harry with a gun he hoped to take from a royal bodyguard, a court was told . But the judge said police would have intervened had Islam, who has previous convictions for dishonesty and for involvement in an attempted robbery, attempted to carry out his plan. The judge said he considered a longer sentence, but said it would have been deemed 'excessive'. 'I would have wished to consider an extended sentence,' he said. 'But the authorities are clear, even if a court finds that the person does represent a danger to the public, that doesn’t justify a longer sentence.' Ms Morrell said her client had a personality disorder. 'Aim for target.  No civilians to be injured....Not to be viewed as Islamist extremist' Notes found on Islam's computer after he confessed murder plot . At a hearing last September, Isleworth Crown Court was told that Islam had 'advanced' plans to shoot Prince Harry at close range with a low-calibre pistol. The court was told that Islam, who separated from his wife and young child in Northern Ireland after making ‘several reckless financial decisions’, converted to the religion in Belfast and changed his name by deed poll in 2010. He spent 10 days in Thailand researching the prince and his whereabouts, before flying back into Heathrow and then walking into Hounslow police station on 23 May and saying he wanted to talk about a murder, the court heard. The would-be killer gave himself up after he began to feel nervous about his plans, which he intended to carry out the next day, the court was told.  It was alleged he aimed to disarm an officer during a parade because he did not want to bring a firearm into London. Police then found a document on Islam’s computer that read: ‘Aim for target. No civilians to be injured. Dress code is the biker look. Use low-calibre pistol at close range. Not to be viewed as Islamist extremist.’ Islam was said to have converted to the religion while serving time in prison for fraud.","Ashraf Islam, 31, was born Mark Townley in Belfast but converted to Islam .

"(CNN) -- Hunter Moore was once dubbed the ""most hated man on the Internet"" and the ""Revenge Porn King."" But now, the brash Californian is at risk of getting a new title. A felon. Moore, the founder of a now defunct ""revenge porn"" website, was indicted and is accused of hacking into people's e-mail accounts to steal nude photos to post online, federal authorities said. Moore, 27, who the FBI says operated isanyoneup.com, was arrested in Woodland, California, on Thursday. Also arrested was Charles Evens, a 25-year-old man in Southern California believed to be connected to the scheme. 'You took the picture' In 2012, way before this arrest, Moore talked to HLN's Dr. Drew about the website. ""The site was just born, actually,"" Moore said. ""It was just a couple of friends and, you know, we had our hearts broken by a couple of girls, and we thought we would make a site. And it became Is Anyone Up. That's how it started. Of course. But when I did start the site, I was hurt, and so was my friends."" But later in the show, a woman who called in confronted Moore and said she regretted taking topless photos for a boyfriend and was devastated when the pictures appeared online. ""I don't know how you can point your finger at me,"" Moore responded."" You took the picture. I mean, I've been justifying this in my head for over a year and a half of the site. But at the end of the day, it started with you. You took these pictures."" Site got out of hand . The FBI says Moore and Evens conspired to peddle ""hundreds"" of nude pictures, without getting permission in 2011 and 2012. But according to an indictment, Moore allegedly pushed Evens to hack into computers to get more sexually explicit photos. Moore then would pay Evens for the photos and then post them on the site, according to the FBI. Both suspects are named in a 15-count indictment with charges that include aggravated identity theft and conspiracy. If convicted, they face up to five years in federal prison for each conspiracy and hacking-related charge. Moore shut down the website in 2012 and sold it to an anti-bullying group. ""Taking down the site has been something I've wanted to do for months,"" he said. ""It was just something I created that got out of hand. It was supposed to be for friends.""

The alligator, named Snappy by its owner April Rognlin, was kept as a pet along with her three dogs.

Police in Ocean Shores, some 130 miles from Seattle, said that they seized the reptile following a tip off from the property's owner. They found Snappy in the back seat of Mrs Rognlin's vehicle. The reptile also had its own rockery alongside the paddling pool and lived happily alongside the three dogs. But the terms of Mrs Rognlin's lease did not allow her to keep the 'pet' and ownership of an American Black alligator is also against Washington law, police said.

"Tragic: Ben Cowburn, 18,was found dead in December 2010 . A popular TV comedian dedicated a performance to a teenage boy who had killed himself just months after allegedly being ‘groomed’ by the star. An inquest has heard the gay comedian ‘took advantage’ of Ben Cowburn after introducing the fashion student to his ‘hedonistic lifestyle’, involving parties fuelled by alcohol and drugs. But despite the serious nature of the accusations against the comedian, he was referred to simply as ‘Mr X’ during the inquest after the coroner backed an informal agreement to protect his name. An MP criticised the decision last night and said the public should be concerned if there are ‘deals being done behind closed doors preventing basic facts coming into the public domain’. The inquest heard that the teenager was showered with gifts and promised a job by the celebrity, but spiralled into depression after falling out with the star, who left him feeling ‘belittled and humiliated’. When their relationship ended Ben, 18, was left feeling ‘dirty and used’ and was admitted to a mental health hospital, where he killed himself. Months after the teenager’s death, the comedian posted an affectionate message on the internet in which he named Ben and dedicated a show to him. Coroner Dr Emma Carlyon made the decision to protect the star’s identity after talks with lawyers representing the NHS and the Cowburn family. They decided that it would be unfair to name the star as he had not been questioned, cautioned or arrested by the police, despite them being aware of the allegations. He was not asked to give evidence to the inquest. Criticising the move, Tory MP Priti Patel said: ‘Nobody should be going down the legal route to prevent the disclosure of basic facts around a court hearing. ‘The public need to know that key evidence and key facts are not being kept from them.’ The inquest last week heard how the older man had crept into bed beside Ben after a late-night party, later engaging in a sex act. At another party the teenager was persuaded to strip by a group of men and groped before a partygoer intervened. In a statement to the inquest, Ben’s twin sister Sophia said that the family had ‘concerns’ about him being ‘groomed by Mr X’. Scotland Yard was made aware of allegations that Ben ‘may have been the victim of a serious sexual assault’. But after interviewing nurses involved in his care, the Met decided there was ‘no conclusive evidence’. Bereaved: Sharon and Steve Cowburn, Ben's parents, are pictured arriving at the inquest a week ago . The talented student first met the star in a pub after he moved to London from his family home in Truro, Cornwall, to study at the Fashion Retail Academy, founded by billionaire tycoon Sir Philip Green. When David Cameron visited the college in 2010, Ben asked him a question and in his first year he was chosen to attend a lunch with Sir Philip. The comedian was unavailable for comment yesterday. The inquest continues today. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","TV comedian allegedly 'took advantage' of 18-year-old Ben Cowburn .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A father-of-two who lost his entire memory after a breakdown has spoken of his struggle - and re-proposed to his loyal wife live on TV. Two years ago, Damian Hammond left for work as usual but never made it - instead ending up in A&E after completely losing his . memory due to a combination of stress and trauma. When his wife Cathy eventually located him in a local hospital, she was told he had total memory loss. Scroll down for video . Devoted: Damian Hill lost his entire memory two years ago. He didn't even know his own name, recognise himself or wife Cathy after the incident . New memories: Today Damian re-proposed to his wife live on national TV as a thank you for her love and support . When she later walked into the hospital room, he had no idea who she was - instead thinking she was a doctor. Over the past two years, she has remained by his side, trying to teach him not only about his past, but also how to perform basic activities such as brushing his teeth and getting dressed. Mr Hammond, 35, told ITV's This Morning: 'I was driving to work one night in May 2012 when I was struck with a severe bout of stress. 'Hours later, I woke up in hospital. Then a woman walked into the hospital bay and said ""Damian"". 'I thought she was a doctor and looked at her blankly. He told presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes: 'I love her with all my heart', and then turned to Cathy and said: 'Will you re-marry me?, to which she replied 'yes, I will.' True love: Damian said even when he didn't recognise Cathy, he thought she looked nice . 'She said ""Damian - that is your name. I'm Cathy and I'm your wife"". 'I didn't know what a wife was. 'She lifted up her wedding ring finger and clicked her ring into mine. We have jigsaw wedding rings and that made me realise we must be linked in some way.' 'I saw her and thought ""she looks nice and friendly"". I was quite excited, but confused. Cathy then explained the couple have two children - and fortunately, Damian had their names tattooed on his arm. Recalling the fateful night, Cathy told presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes: 'His work called to say he hadn't turned up and so I called the Police. 'I saw her and thought ""she looks nice and friendly"". I was quite excited, but confused.,' he recalled . 'Later that evening I got a call from the local hospital saying there was a chap there called Damain Hammond. 'My first question was ""is he alive or dead""? 'They said he was fit and well, but couldn't remember anything.' She admitted that she had no idea how extreme his memory loss would be. 'I had to fib to the children a bit, as you do. I told them that Daddy had slipped on mud, hit his head and had lost a bit of memory.' Damian's memory loss was so bad that he didn't even recognise himself in the mirror. 'I was scared, as I am a big chap,' he said . She then began the painstaking - and often heartbreaking - process of teaching her husband who he was, his past, and how to live. Damian's memory loss was so bad that he didn't even recognise himself in the mirror. 'I was scared, as I am a big chap [and wondered who it was],' he explained to Ruth and Eamonn. Cathy said his personalty was also much more formal. 'He was very innocent and wide-eyed and would call me Catherine, rather than a nickname,' she recalls. Two years on, he is still unable to remember huge swathes of his past. Damian says there have been flickers of his childhood that have returned - and he has had dozens of old friends contact him on social media to help try and plug the gap. But there have been other times when his memory loss has devastated him. He told the programme: 'There were some pictures of me holding the children after they were born and I couldn't remember any of it. I just sat there and burst out crying.' But Cathy says she now focuses on creating new memories, rather than trying to re-invoke old ones with bags of old photos. And this morning, he paved the way to making more new memories by asking his wife to 're-marry' him. He told Ruth and Eamonn: 'I love her with all my heart', and then turned to Cathy and said: 'Will you re-marry me?, to which she replied 'yes, I will.'","Two years ago, Damian Hammond, 35, lost all his memory due to stress .

There are no trendy yoga hybrids here and no corpulent spa menus stuffed with 'journeys' and 'rituals'.

"Hackers who stole thousands of credit card numbers from U.S. security firm Stratfor are now set to release 2.7 million of its confidential emails. The loose-knit Anonymous movement vowed to heap further embarrassment on the intelligence company, dubbed the 'Shadow CIA', it hacked over Christmas. It wants to humiliate the firm, which . uses a global network of sources to create daily intelligence briefings . on security and financial risk, by publishing the communications. And it said they could provide the 'smoking gun for a number of crimes'. Stolen: Hacking group 'Anonymous' is set to publish 2.7 million emails sent from Stratfor's global network of sources . Anonymous posted the credit card numbers of 30,000 of its clients - including executives from HSBC and Barclays and a member of the House of Lords - on Monday. They were then used, it claimed, to donate $1 million to charity. Activist Barrett Brown told The Times that, if the emails were published, the sources risked exposure. He said: 'People talking off the record to a think-tank are going to disclose a lot of information. Their identities are likely to be in the emails. 'Both my grandfathers dropped bombs on . people. I'm not blowing up any villages. I want to not inconvenience or . damage people but, if we do, I'm not terribly worried about it. 'We're in a state of conflict with the Government. Either we are going to jail or we're going to win.' Promising more: Anonymous recently hacked into think-tank Stratfor pictured above, and stole thousands of emails . He said the emails could 'provide the smoking gun for a number of crimes of extraordinary importance' and revealed Stratfor may have the opportunity to redact some of the communications. The threat to publish the emails mirrors that of Wikileaks who leaked thousands of unredacted diplomatic cables earlier this year. A total of 1,195 British credit cards have been leaked. Anonymous boasted on Monday of stealing Stratfor's confidential client list, which includes entities ranging from Apple Inc to the U.S. Air Force to the Miami Police Department, and mining it for more than 4,000 credit card numbers, passwords and home addresses. The hackers said Stratfor, based in Austin, Texas and who charges subscribers for its reports and analysis, were 'clueless' when it came to database security. They taunted on a message on Twitter: 'Not so private and secret anymore?' before promising that the attack was just the beginning of a Christmas-inspired assault on a long list of targets. Anonymous said the client list it had already posted was a small slice of the 200 gigabytes worth of plunder it stole from Stratfor and promised more leaks. It said it was able to get the credit card details in part because Stratfor did not bother encrypting them - an easy-to-avoid blunder which, if true, would be a major embarrassment for any security-related company. Fred Burton, Stratfor's vice president of intelligence, said the company had reported the intrusion to law enforcement and was working with them on the investigation. And he added that Stratfor has protections in place meant to prevent such attacks. He said: 'But I think the hackers live in this kind of world where once they fixate on you or try to attack you it's extraordinarily difficult to defend against.'","Stratfor has been dubbed the 'Shadow CIA'

'That contract means manipulation. It means engagement with the management. It's not a contract - it's null.'

Such is the case of California woman Sylvia Mashiah, who was busted with 27 pounds of methamphetamine Monday night after driving her car in a Customs lot specifically marked for suspect vehicles meant to be searched by federal agents. Her car had not been ordered into that area, but thanks to her mistake she let investigators find the 17 packages of meth hidden in the rear quarter panels of her 2006 Ford Focus.

"Health chiefs are planning to close a Burger King that is located inside a hospital after years of complaints the fast-food restaurant does not live up to health standards. The branch in Southampton General Hospital will be closed next year after attracting criticism from politicians and health organisations. Hospital chiefs say it is no longer in keeping with the 'healthcare environment' bosses wish to portray, and will not renew the fast food restaurant's lease when it expires in 2016. A hospital in Southampton has decided to close the Burger King restaurant in its lobby following complaints from healthcare organisations and politicians that it did not live up to health standards . The fast food giant has had an outlet in the hospital for almost 20 years. 'The trust is currently in the process of redeveloping its main entrance retail area,' a spokesman for Southampton General Hospital said. 'This is to ensure it is more reflective of the healthcare environment in which it is situated. 'The Burger King franchise currently occupies a retail space that is leased until 2016, but there are no plans to extend the contract beyond that point,' a spokesman for the hospital said. Dr Hilary Jones supported the decision, saying: 'Let’s tackle obesity and let’s start by ensuring hospitals are healthy places. The fast food restaurant in Southampton General Hospital was found not to reflect a healthcare environment . A typical meal at the fast food outlet which has been inside the hospital for more than 20 years . A poster encouraging patients and visitors to give the restaurant feedback hangs next to ward directions . The hospital will not extend Burger King's long-held lease in the facility when it is up for renewal in 2016 . 'You would not get a doctor telling patients to stop off for a burger and a can of Coke. 'If you are being told to eat healthy and exercise by overweight doctors and nurses it is hypocrisy so we should be setting a better example.' MP Rob Flello, chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on obesity, said: 'I think fast food outlets like Burger King have their place, but being in a hospital is not an appropriate. 'This is welcome news and I hope other hospitals take the time to review the outlets that they have.' Burger King have declined to comment. Earlier this year it emerged that a hospital in Dundee was selling an 800-calorie, 'heart attack' pie in its canteen. Critics described the delicacy as 'a heart attack on a plate'. Ninewells Hospital admitted selling the pies at one of its takeaway restaurants, but insisted there were also healthy options on the menu.

"By . Emma Innes . PUBLISHED: . 10:27 EST, 18 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:48 EST, 18 June 2013 . British adults today are more self-obsessed and worry more about their daily lives than those who lived through the Blitz, a new book claims. This is despite the fact they don't have to worry about bombs, blackouts and rationing, says psychologist Graham Price. He adds that today’s adults spend twice as much time fretting about their lives as those who lived through the Blitz. British adults today are self-obsessed . and 'consumed' with negative thoughts about their own personal problems from work and money to relationships, a psychologist has claimed . The book, The Promise, also claims that Britons have forgotten how to 'look on the bright side of life'. Mr Price suggests the poster, Keep Calm and Carry On, would have worked during the Second World War but has less effect today, despite the slogan's recent resurrection. The problem is that today's adults are 'consumed' with negative thoughts about their own personal problems from work and money to relationships, he believes. In contrast, during the war there was a more positive attitude because it helped people to deal with what were much more serious problems all around them, said Mr Price. Psychologist Graham Price claims we now worry more about our daily lives than those who lived through the Blitz (pictured in Birmingham) - and are also more stressed and likely to have anxiety problems . His book, described as ‘a handbook for personal development’, is based on his analysis of several hundred patients he has treated for stress or anxiety related issues. From having a 'wartime spirit' while bombs were falling all around them in the 1940s, Britons now suffer from a 'stress epidemic', he said. Mr Price suggests the poster, Keep Calm and Carry On, would have worked during the Second World War but has less effect today . He added: ‘There's no doubt that people in war-torn Britain were seriously concerned about all manner of things, from the threat of invasion down to the state of their personal finance. ‘Yet records show they were able to keep things in perspective, which often meant looking on the bright side - even at the most difficult of times. ‘Resilience was then a cornerstone of the British character. ‘Modern Britons, on the other hand, are consumed with anxiety, most of which is brought on by non-life-threatening issues like employment, finance and relationships. ‘Compared to the war, we've never had it so good - but based on anxiety levels you wouldn't know it.’ Stress is now the most common reason for absence from work and has also been linked with increased rates of associated illnesses from dementia to high blood pressure, he said. The positive attitudes of wartime Britons has led to Mr Price drawing up a stress-busting programme called Acceptance Action Training. It encourages the Churchillian 'indomitable spirit' of the Second World War in dealing with problems and how to develop a positive attitude. Mr Price said: ‘Maintaining a realistic, positive attitude to the problems that come our way got Britain through its darkest days. ‘Winston Churchill was the perfect embodiment of this. ‘He didn't waste time and energy dwelling on problems but instead accepted the situation and looked to what could be done to improve things going forward.’","Psychologist Graham Price says British adults today are more self-obsessed .

"The five Olympic boxers from Cameroon who ‘vanished’ three weeks ago have reappeared at a South London gym for a sparring session. The boxers disappeared from the Olympic village with a swimmer and a footballer after being beaten in their bouts during the Games. It was confirmed on August 7 that the team had gone AWOL by David Ojong, Cameroon’s Olympics chief and had not returned home with the rest the athletes. Missing Cameroon Olympic athletes. Top L to R:  Blaise Yepmou Mendouo, Christin Donrack Adjoufack, Thomas Essomba, Drusille Ngako - Bottom row L to R; Paul Ekane Edingue, Serge Ambomo, Abdon Mewoli . Thomas Essomba of Cameroon departs the ring following victory in his match against Abdelali Daraa of Morocco during the London 2012 Olympic Games . Thomas Essomba was happy to fly punches but not to fly home . It was feared they were staying below the radar in the UK in a bid to secure permanent asylum once their Olympic accreditation had expired. However, the temptation of punchbags, dumbbells and medicine balls, was too much and the gym-goers blew their cover by turning up at a boxing gym in New Cross, South London. On Monday, the five boxers - Thomas Essomba, 24, Christian Donfack Adjoufack, 28, Yhyacinthe Mewoli Abdon, 26, Blaise Yepmou Mendouo, 27 and Serge Ambomo, 26 - showed up at the Double Jab Boxing Club in New Cross, South London. The Cameroon boxers failed to resist the lure of laying into a punchbag . It is alleged the group showed up and asked for a training session with coach Patrick Harris, after hearing he was a ‘top coach’. Jim Addis, an assistant coach at the boxing club, said this week: 'We were all completely gobsmacked when they turned up. 'We knew they had gone missing, but were dumbfounded when we realised who they were. 'They knew Patrick and asked especially for him and they all took part in sparring sessions.' Mr Addis said that as news spread of the team's appearance the gym became increasingly busy with regulars. He added: 'It was amazing - the gym was packed and the atmosphere was superb and was one of the best nights we have had here. 'It’s a great honour to have them in the gym and we are all over the moon - they have even asked to come back for more training.” The five boxers claimed they were ‘currently living in Lewisham’, with Mr Addis adding: 'They told me they wanted to stay here and were very keen to come back to the club. 'We all want to help them as much as we can and understand they will be applying to stay here in the UK.' Under Olympic accreditation rules the boxers can stay in the UK until November, but will then have to apply for permission to remain in the country. Two other Cameroon athletes also vanished at the same time as the boxers - Drusille Ngako Tchimi, 25, a stand-by goalkeeper for Cameroon’s women’s team, and swimmer Paul Ekane Edingue, 21, who are both still missing . Jackie Brock-Doyle, organiser Locog’s director of communications, said after the seven athletes went missing: 'They have been reported as missing but they have visas to stay in this country until November, so right now they haven’t done anything wrong. 'We are in quite a difficult position at the moment because they are able to be in this country, they are able to do what they like in this country, obviously within reason, but until that changes it is quite difficult.' The boxers fled from the Olympic Village after being beaten in their fights . The disappearances are not the first time Cameroonian athletes have gone missing during international sports competitions.At past Francophonie and Commonwealth games events, as well as at junior soccer competitions, several Cameroonians have quit their delegation without official consent.","Cameroon's entire Olympic boxing team show up at Double Jab Boxing Club .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Margaret Thatcher is to blame for the growing popularity of UKIP, Tory Cabinet minister Eric Pickles has claimed. The Local Government Secretary said the former Tory Prime Minister was 'such a phenomenal leader' that today's leaders are just 'shades of monotone'. He said Nigel Farage's party were just 'a mirror image' the the main political parties - and should not be treated as radical outsiders. Nigel Farage has benefited from today's politicians all having to accept Thatcher's legacy, claims Eric Pickles . Mr Pickles' comments are likely to cause anger in Number 10 over the suggestion that Mr Cameron does not have the pulling power of the late Lady Thatcher. The Communities Secretary was asked in an interview with Total Politics magazine about the rise of UKIP. He said: 'In many ways it's Mrs Thatcher's fault. She was such a phenomenal leader. She affected not just the Conservative Party but the Labour Party and the Lib Dems. She brought the middle ground to the right. 'What's the difference between what Blair was trying to do and the difference between Major and Blair? It becomes shades of monotone. He added that the way to tackle UKIP was to 'connect with the man on the street'. Mr Pickles said: 'It's always tempting for a political party to say ""well, if we just do this, if we just have this policy, if we just make this pledge, it will shoot their fox"". No. 'You've got to see these things in context. I don't doubt the next election is really a choice between 'do you want to see David Cameron or Ed Miliband through the door of Number 10'. 'I think people will make that decision, but it isn't enough for us to do that. The reason why UKIP has done well is something that we need to understand about the way we connect.' Mr Pickles added: 'They're kind of a mirror image of us. I don't believe that UKIP is different from any other political party. 'It will have some very nice people within it; it will have some less nice people within it. I've always been of the view that there isn't a silver bullet about UKIP. 'It's not about Europe and it's not about immigration. It's about us. It's about the political system. And it's a rage against the machine. 'The only way you can beat UKIP is be good councillors, be good MPs, connect with the population, the man on the street, talk to folks and do all of the types of things you would do if you were fighting a Liberal.' Thatcherite cabinet minister Eric Pickles said Mrs Thatcher had been so 'phenomenal' that other leaders paled in comparison . But he suggested the party's rise could actually benefit the Tories. He said: 'I saw something on the doorstep this year which I hadn't seen before. I'm talking about Newark. 'It was, I think, in Bingham, in a sort of housing estate, a very traditional Labour voter, and they said they were going to vote Tory for the first time to keep UKIP out. 'That's very unusual. In all the years of fighting Liberals and the protest vote, I've never come across somebody who wanted to actually stop the protest vote. 'I thought that was really interesting. I haven't entirely got my mind round it but I think it offers us some possibilities.","Communities Secretary said she was so 'phenomenal' others can't compare .

"China will never grow at its explosive rate again but India is yet to match its GDP output, Russia is lagging and Turkey's potential is being leached by political turbulence, according to participants in an economic panel hosted by CNN's John Defterios. So where can the world expect to find growth? The panel, held during June's St. Petersburg International Economic Forum -- known as Russia's ""Davos"" -- explored the issue with experts. CNN's guests were Hakan Ates, president and ceo of DenizBank; Emilio Lozoya, ceo of PEMEX; Charles Robertson, global chief economist at Renaissance Capital; Vladimir Yakunin, president of Russian Railways and Nikolai Zelenski, ceo of Nordgold. READ MORE: Russia FinMin: We will survive if Fed winds down stimulus . Between them, the panelists represented countries from the BRICs, and other countries tagged as ones to watch. Robertson kicked off the conversation with his blunt assessment of the world's potential to be dragged out of its mire by China. The country, whose economy was last year flagged to become the world's biggest by 2016, has slowed and expectations for its growth downgraded. Robertson said the country ""will  never again grow at a sustainable 10%."" But the BRIC's other true pillar -- India -- cannot yet match its potential, he added. Russia and Brazil are the other two nations that fall under the BRIC acronym, coined by former Goldman Sachs economist Jim O'Neill, and they are struggling. Russia has been reliant on commodities but prices have been falling in recent months -- and impacting the country's growth prospects. READ MORE: New powers don't need west . Yakunin's role as head of the country's railways affords him a birds-eye view of the country's investment potential.  And he pointed to the need for investment in the real economy, rather than just financial services, to boost growth and create jobs. But, as Yakunin noted, the much-vaunted diversification of the economy has proved difficult for Russia to tackle. According to Zelenski, a lack of infrastructure investment is also the key problem in Russia. Further, he argues the country did not put away enough when the times were good, unlike China. READ MORE: To Russia: Create change with football . Meanwhile in Turkey, which is not a BRIC nation but has enjoyed a buoyant economy despite the turmoil of countries around it,  faces a rockier path to EU membership after the government's heavy-handed approach to the protestors. During the keynote panel at the forum, Germany chancellor Angela Merkel said she was ""shocked"" at the reaction to the protests and questioned if it was the right time for Turkey to join the European Union. The diplomatic hiccup comes after years of strong growth by Turkey under Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's hand. According to Ates, the protests were not against economic pain, given the country's strong record of growth. But, when asked if Erdogan had been in power too long, he noted people needed to express themselves  to secure democracy. ""We will see at the next election if it has been too long,"" he added. Turkey should see cause for hope, Ates said. He sees a ""promising and favorable"" landscape for investors in Turkey, with a well educated population. ""The human capital is there...but we still have to do more."" WATCH MORE: Bank of BRICs? Lozoya said Mexico was another economy with significant potential due to its natural resources and proximity to Latin America. According to Lozoya, there is ""huge potential"" in areas such as manufacturing and petro-chemicals, and the chance to feed hungry markets Latin and North America.

A British fortune teller, who set out from Sussex to seek her own fortune when she was in her late teens, has been found naked and dead in a seedy rented room in Vietnam. Julia Anne Jay, 43, had been renting the room in Saigon, also known as Ho Chi Minh City, since January as she plied her trade as a fortune teller in the nearby streets. But police have been called to the hotel, located in an alley in the city’s backpacker district, after the staff broke into her room on the second floor and found her body in the initial stages of decomposition. Tragic fate: British fortune teller Julia Anne Jay, aged 43, was found dead in her hotel room in Ho Chi Minh City . Although there were no obvious signs . of foul play, police, confirming Miss Jay had been dead for several . days, said they were continuing their investigations. It is believed Miss Jay is the same . woman who set out from her English home in her late teens to travel . through South East Asia, working her way as she went. In recent months she has been a . familiar figure in scarfs and traditional dress, earning what she can in . the Pha Ngu Lao district of the city by turning over her tarot cards . and reading palms of people in the street. In a recent interview with the . ex-patriate magazine AsiaLife, she said she had first learned the ways . of a fortune teller at the age of eight from a friend of her adopted . grandmother. Then, in her late teens, she set off from Sussex for the far east, where she has spent most of her life. She bought precious stones and silver . in India and sold them in Greece, where a friend gave her a pack of . tarot cards, she told the magazine. Then she travelled back to the far . east, setting up in Bali where she ran a guesthouse for 10 years and . spent large amounts of time meditating. She said of her fortune-telling skills: ‘I believe I’m 100 per cent accurate. I wouldn’t be doing it if I weren’t.’ While most of her clients in recent . times have been Vietnamese - many have hired her to go to their homes - . she has told fortunes for Western tourists. Popular destination: Ben Tranh market in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, is a regular hotspot for backpackers . Holiday resort: Many visitors to the country head for Ho Chi Minh. Julia Anne Jay had been renting a room there since January . Sometimes, she told the magazine, a . 15-minute reading might turn into an emotional two or three-hour . sessions ending with the customer in tears. On one occasion, she recalled, a henchman for a local mafia ‘godfather’ came to search her out to set up a session for his boss. ‘Afterwards he (the Mafioso) ordered . loads of beer and insisted on me staying there,’ she told the magazine. ‘Then I asked the translator “He’s happy with me, right?” and he said . “Yes, he loves you. You’re 90 per cent correct.”’ However, Miss Jay said that foreigners displayed mixed feelings about her. ‘Some tourists, mainly young English . guys, in a foreign country for the first time, are feeling unnerved and . want to show off. They can sometimes give me a hard time.’ A crowd of people who knew the . fortune teller gathered outside the small hotel where she had been . staying when an ambulance came to pick up her body and carry it to the . mortuary.

"(CNN) -- Andy Murray thrilled his home crowd in July when he became the first British man in 77 years to win the Wimbledon singles title. But Murray will most likely miss the second highest profile tennis event in Britain -- the year-end championships in November -- after choosing to undergo surgery for a lingering back injury. The 26-year-old Scot has had back issues in spurts throughout his career and was forced to pull out of the French Open in May prior to his historic fortnight at the All England Club. His withdrawal in Paris marked the first time since the 2007 clay-court tournament in France that Murray had skipped one of tennis' four majors. That year, he hurt his wrist. Murray exited earlier than expected at two U.S. Open warm-up tournaments and was then upset by Stanislas Wawrinka in straight sets in the quarterfinals in New York this month as the defending champion. ""Next week, Andy is set to undergo minor back surgery in an effort to clear up a longstanding back problem,"" Murray's management team said in a statement sent to CNN. ""The issue flared up again during the Rome Masters this year when Andy was forced to retire and he sought advice from a range of specialists in May. ""After a successful return on the more forgiving grass courts, Andy enjoyed success at Queen's and Wimbledon, but after recently playing on hard courts and clay, Andy once again sought medical advice about solving the issue once and for all. ""The aim is to be fully fit for the new season."" Murray thus becomes the second member of the so-called 'Big Four' to miss a chunk of the 2013 schedule -- Rafael Nadal didn't play at the Australian Open in January as he continued to recover from his knee troubles. And 17-time grand slam winner Roger Federer has dealt with his own back problems, not playing at the Rogers Cup in Montreal during the U.S. Open Series. Murray can take heart from Nadal's performances after the Spaniard returned to the tour. Nadal claimed the French Open and captured his 13th major at the U.S. Open by downing Novak Djokovic.","Andy Murray will undergo minor back surgery and most likely miss the rest of 2013 .

The source of a huge cluster of floating volcanic rocks spotted last week off the coast of New Zealand has been discovered.

The enormous mass of floating pumice covers almost 26,000 square kilometres (10,000 square miles) and was found drifting in the South Pacific, the New Zealand Navy said on Friday.

Lieutenant Tim Oscar said that while he knew his ship, HMNZS Canterbury, was in no danger from the pumice, which is solidified lava filled with air bubbles, it was still the weirdest thing he's seen in 18 years at sea. 'As far ahead as I could observe was a raft of pumice moving up and down with the swell,' he said. 'The rock looked to be sitting two foot (half a metre) above the surface of the waves and lit up a brilliant while colour in the spotlight. It looked exactly like the edge of an ice shelf.' Earlier scientists aboard the ship said the pumice probably came from an underwater volcano called Monowai, which has been active recently.

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Thousands of people are taking part Saturday in a march through the Northern Ireland city of Belfast that many fear could inflame tensions between Catholics and Protestants. Over the course of the day, up to 30,000 people were expected to join the Ulster Covenant parade, held to mark the 100th anniversary of the signing of a pro-union document which helped shape Northern Ireland's history. The parade left from Belfast City Hall Saturday morning, headed for the grounds of Stormont, beside the Parliament Buildings. Concerns over potential disorder along the route center have focused on an area near St. Patrick's Church, where violence flared up between Catholics and Protestants earlier this month. The parade passed near the flashpoint Roman Catholic church, near the city center, without incident Saturday morning but must still return along that route in the evening. Hundreds of police officers are stationed along the route in that area, with many more elsewhere in the city, as the Northern Ireland police service braces for possible trouble. About 2,000 people took part in the morning parade feeding into the main demonstration, in which tens of thousands are expected to take part. The parade, a special event for the Ulster Covenant centenary, is expected to be one of the biggest held in years. Hundreds of parades take place across Northern Ireland each year, the majority involving the Protestant Orange Order and associated organizations, although pro-Irish nationalists also have marches. The Northern Ireland Parades Commission rules on which marches are allowed to take place and which are banned, in an effort to keep friction to a minimum. Most parades pass off peacefully, but when members of one community march near or through neighborhoods dominated by another, violence sometimes occurs. The rioting in Belfast earlier this month, which left dozens of police officers injured, was some of the worst seen by the city in years. Tensions have been high all summer, and behind-the-scenes talks over Saturday's highly symbolic parade did not succeed in brokering a compromise between the Catholic and Protestant communities over the staging of the event. The Ulster Covenant was a document signed in 1912 by nearly half a million people in opposition to steps by the government in Westminster to introduce ""Home Rule,"" or self-government, in Ireland within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The majority of the island gained independence in 1921, following two years of conflict. But six of the nine counties of the province of Ulster chose to stay in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming the country of Northern Ireland. In the late 1960s, the conflict between mainly Protestant unionists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, and largely Roman Catholic nationalists, who want it to be reunited with the rest of Ireland, exploded into a political and sectarian war, known as the Troubles. The three decades of ensuing violence between the Irish Republican Army and loyalists claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people, most of them north of the border. While the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 effectively ended the conflict, suspicions between Catholics and Protestants remain. Under the terms of the landmark accord, terrorist groups on both sides dumped their weapons, and Sinn Fein, the political affiliate of the IRA, now work with pro-British politicians in Northern Ireland's power-sharing government. Journalist Peter Taggart and CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","Thousands of police are deployed in Belfast to prevent possible outbreaks of violence .

"A member of AC/DC says the band has not spoken with Phil Rudd since he was charged with threatening to kill and possessing methamphetamine and marijuana last week. Angus Young, 59, said in an interview with Rolling Stone on Thursday that Rudd's behavior was somewhat erratic while recording the band's new album, 'Rock or Bust.' Young explained that Rudd, 60, was a no-show to recordings and video shoots, and that the band has resolved to continue the album campaign with or without him. From left: Brian Johnson, Malcolm Young, Phil Rudd, Angus Young, and Cliff Williams performing  during a concert in Germany. Young says his band mates have not been in touch with Rudd since he was charged . 'Well, we had a few problems. The situation he's in - that took everyone by surprise,' Young told Rolling Stone. 'We had a few issues before with him, even when we were recording it was hard even to get to him to do the recording.' 'And then he was supposed to show up to do promos with us, to do video shoots and a few shoots and a few other things, and he never showed up for that either. So, at this stage, it's a pretty tough call for us,' Young said. Rudd, who has been with the band on and off for nearly four decades, was released last week. He is expected to appear in court in New Zealand on Nov. 27. 'We haven't had contact,' Young said in New York City. 'But he has his people that represent him. He's got himself in a pickle.' Police had initially accused Rudd of trying to arrange for a hit man to carry out two killings. Police had charged him with attempting to procure murder, which comes with a maximum 10-year sentence; the charge was dropped after a day. Rudd, 60, could face a maximum prison term of seven years for the charge of threatening to kill. Young says AC/DC will continue to promote the album and perform without Rudd, if need be. The band will launch a tour next year. 'We were resolved for us to go forward and I think Phil's got — it's something he's got to do himself. He's got to sort himself out I think,' the guitarist said. 'But we were resolved to go forward. So at this point it's kind of a question mark. But if we're touring, there will be a drummer in place, put it that way.' The Australian band also faced a shake-up in its lineup when 61-year-old guitarist Malcolm Young, who has dementia, announced in September he was leaving the group because of his health. Stevie Young, nephew of founding members Malcolm and Angus Young, played guitar on the band's new album and will join them on the tour. Rock or Bust is due to be released on Dec. 2.

Iain Russell, 76, spent 40 years in the Merchant Navy and squirrelled away his pay, building up £1.2million in cash. He lived with his wife Irene in Lanarkshire who died two years ago but he then suffered a brain haemorrhage and died in October last year. But his friends and family have been left shocked after it was revealed he had £550,000 in bank accounts, £450,000 in cash and stocks, and even £144,000 in a bank on the Isle of Man. Mr Russell left £62,000 to friends and family but ordered the rest of his money be shared by four charities, who will receive around £290,000 each. Diabetes Scotland, MacKenzie Fund for Heart Cardiology, the Guild of Benevolence of the Institute of Marine Engineering and the Royal National Institute for the Blind(RNIB) will all receive windfalls. Iain served in the Army but spent most of his career at sea and working on the River Clyde as a member of a tug boat crew. He lived a modest life and friends have insisted he did not know how much he was worth. Close colleague, Thomas MacDonald, 72, served alongside Iain in the Merchant Navy. Mr MacDonald, of Forth, Lanarkshire, said: 'We both served our time together in Morton machine company in Wishaw then Iain was taken to the Army. 'He joined the Merchant Navy in the 1970s and became chief engineer. He stayed in the Navy for 40 years. 'I was totally surprised at the amount Iain left. We were like brothers, probably even closer, and we used to discuss finances and what we would do with any money we had. 'I knew his uncle had died and left him some money and shares but I've no idea how much. 'I'm quite sure Iain was unaware, I don't think he ever knew what was there.' Thomas also revealed Iain refused to pay for private health care even when he fell seriously ill. He added: 'He stayed down in Salford latterly because he was getting treated for a brain haemorrhage. 'I pleaded with him to go and pay for the operation privately but he wouldn't do it.' Humble: Mr Russell lived in this council house in Shotts, Lanarkshire, and spent 40 years in the merchant navy . A neighbour said: 'He was a very quiet man who kept himself to himself but he was very pleasant when you met him in the street. £550,000 in bank accounts . £450,000 in cash and stocks . £144,000 on the Isle of Man. 'It has come as a massive surprise to us that he had so much money, nobody could ever have imagined he was a millionaire.' Iain had been a lifelong member of the Institute of Marine Engineering and they paid tribute to his kindness. A spokeswoman said: 'Mr Russell had been a member of the Institute and a supporter of the Guild for more than 40 years. 'The Trustees greatly appreciate being one of the four charities to benefit from the residue of Mr Russell's estate.' A Diabetes Scotland spokesman said: 'We are incredibly grateful for people like the late Mr Russell who remember the work of our charity with a gift in their will. 'These gifts are vital for helping us make a big difference to the lives of people with diabetes or those at risk of developing the condition.' An RNIB Scotland spokesman added: 'RNIB very much depends on the generosity of the public to help us help blind and partially people, and to work to tackle preventable sight loss.'","Iain Russell has left £290,000 each in his will to four charities he supported .

"By . Jennifer Newton for MailOnline . Animal rights activists targeted models at one of the opening shows of New York Fashion Week which saw them paraded around Central Park on controversial horse-drawn carriages. Victor dE Souza, who has dressed Rihanna, Madonna and Lady Gaga, put seven models in the carriages wearing his designs on Wednesday night, in what was described as a moveable fashion show through the park.

Some even followed the carriages through the park, heckling the models as they made their way around the route. The show saw dE Souza's models wearing extravagant gowns while being taken around the southern area of Central Park in the carriages which were steered by drivers wearing traditional coats, tails and top hats. Speaking before the show, Mr de Souza said: 'Horse-drawn carriages have been a part of the beautiful cityscape that is New York for more than 150 years.

The park's horse-drawn carriages have proved controversial in recent months after city mayor Bill De Blasio said the use of the animals is inhumane. A battle between animal rights activists and drivers of the carriages has been raging, with those who work in the city stables warning that the horses could become horse meat in countries such as Mexico. They argue that the carriage business provides a home for unwanted horses from the farming and racing industries. With this sanctuary eliminated, these animals will be shipped off to be killed for meat, they say.

"Powdered alcohol hasn't even arrived in stores yet, but states already are moving to ban the product touted by its inventor as an easy way to mix a drink on the go. Colorado is the latest state considering prohibiting 'Palcohol' amid concern it will increase underage drinking. The product is marketed as an ounce of rum or vodka in powdered form, which is then added to water. Each serving is the equivalent of a shot of liquor, according to Lipsmark, the company that owns Palcohol. Scroll down for video . Legislators in five states have already outlawed Palcohol before its planned launch next year . The controversial product is awaiting approval by the Food and Drug Administration before it can launch . 'I think being proactive and jumping out in front of the problem is probably the right thing to do,' said Chris Johnson, executive director of the County Sheriffs of Colorado. 'It really doesn't have any place in our society, powered alcohol. We have enough problems with the liquid kind.' Johnson said he fears powdered alcohol will make it easier for children to 'sprinkle it on top of their Wheaties for breakfast' and increase the potential for alcohol poisoning. 'It can be a very dangerous thing,' he said. The company's website notes various instances where they argue the product would be convenient, including on flights and as an antiseptic on remote locations. Palcohol's creator, Mark Phillips, said he thought of the idea because it would be easier to carry powder for a drink during a long hike or other outdoor activities. Alaska, Delaware, Louisiana, South Carolina and Vermont already have banned powdered alcohol, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Minnesota, Ohio, and New York also are considering bans, the organization said. Colorado Republican JoAnn Windholz is planning to introduce a ban on Palcohol in her home state . In a video posted on the company's website, Phillips dismisses the concerns about underage drinking, noting the product would be sold only at liquor stores to people 21 and older. In the video, he also argues it would be impractical for people to snort the powder, as some critics fear, because it would be painful to do and the amount of powder in a package fills about half a glass tumbler. The company doesn't expect Palcohol will be available in stores until spring 2015 at the earliest. They're still waiting for labeling approval from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. The Food and Drug Administration said it does not have a legal basis to block the product after examining the non-alcoholic ingredients in the powder. Lynne Barbour, director of communications for Palcohol, said states should control the product instead of banning it. 'We believe it should be regulated and taxed,' she said in an email. In addition to making Palcohol available as powdered rum and vodka, the company plans four cocktail varieties — Cosmopolitan, Mojito, Lemon Drop, and Powderita. Republican Rep. JoAnn Windholz is sponsoring a bill to ban powdered alcohol in Colorado during the legislative session that begins next month. She said it's prudent for states to ban the product until they know how it can affect people if it happens to be stronger than liquid alcohol — another concern Phillips contends is unfounded. Windholz said states should make sure they have a regulatory system in place before allowing powdered alcohol to be sold. 'It can be taken into schools, it can be taken into sports (events), Broncos games, whatever,' she said.","Legislators are considering a powdered alcohol ban before its US launch .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Senate found Federal Judge G. Thomas Porteous of Louisiana guilty on four articles of impeachment on Wednesday, which will remove him from the federal bench. He had been accused of accepting kick-backs and lying to the Senate and FBI. The vote makes Porteous, 63, only the eighth federal judge in the nation's history to be impeached and convicted. Porteous is also ""forever disqualified to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States,"" Sen. Daniel Inouye said during Wednesday's Senate hearing. The Senate adopted the motion barring Porteous from holding a future federal office by a vote of 94 to 2. In March, the House of Representatives voted unanimously to impeach Porteous on corruption charges. ""Our investigation found that Judge Porteous participated in a pattern of corrupt conduct for years,"" U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Task Force on Judicial Impeachment. In a statement at the time, Porteous' lawyer, Richard W. Westling, said the Justice Department had decided not to prosecute because it did not have credible evidence. ""Unfortunately, the House has decided to disregard the Justice Department's decision and to move forward with impeachment,"" he said. ""As a result, we will now turn to the Senate to seek a full and fair hearing of all of the evidence."" Porteous, who turns 64 this year, was appointed to the federal bench in 1994. He has not worked as a judge since he was suspended with pay in the fall of 2008, Westling said. The most recent previous impeachment of a federal judge by the House was last year. Judge Samuel B. Kent of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas resigned after being impeached on charges of sexual assault, obstructing and impeding an official proceeding and making false and misleading statements, according to the website of the Federal Judicial Center. Before then, Judge Walter L. Nixon of U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi was impeached in 1989 on charges of perjury before a federal grand jury. The Senate convicted him and removed him from office that year.","NEW: Porteous barred from future federal office, accused of taking kick-backs, lying .

"China's new president sought to address concerns among African leaders about the uneven nature of trade relations on Monday, promising an equal relationship that would promote development on the continent. Xi Jinping made the speech defending China's economic role in Africa in Tanzania, the first stop of his African tour. He travels to South Africa on Tuesday and will attend a summit of the BRICS countries in the port city of Durban on Wednesday. The focus on Africa on his first trip overseas trip underscores the strategic importance of the continent's natural resources for the world's second biggest economy, but local leaders are asking whether the relationship has benefited Africa as much as it has China. Xi will finish his trip in the Republic of Congo, from where China imports oil to fuel its economic growth . In what was billed by Chinese media as a major foreign policy speech, Xi said that China had done its best to help Africa's development and insisted on equality among all countries, irrespective of size, strength and wealth. ""Africa belongs to the African people,"" he said. ""In developing relations with Africa, all countries should respect Africa's dignity and independence,"" he added. A lot is at stake. Africa is already a major source of natural resources for China and with African economies now some of the world's fastest growing, it's also an emerging a marketplace for Chinese-made goods. Trade between Africa and China totaled $200 billion in 2012, according to Chinese state media, and the country is Africa's largest trading partner. African leaders have welcomed China's no-strings investment as a counterbalance to Western aid that is usually conditional on reducing poverty, stamping out corruption or introducing democratic reforms. But some, including Botswana President Ian Khama and Nigerian central bank governor Lamido Sanusi, have begun to question to what extent Africa has benefited. ""Cracks are appearing in this China-Africa relationship,"" said CNN Beijing and former Africa correspondent David McKenzie. ""There's a sense from Africans that it's not an equal relationship. That China is extracting oil and then in return building infrastructure projects with its own companies and own workers and not necessarily transferring the skills to African workers."" Xi signed trade and cultural agreements in Tanzania on Sunday and is due to meet with South African counterpart Jacob Zuma on Tuesday. He will then fly to Durban to attend the BRICS summit -- which groups Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- where plans to create a multinational lender to rival the World Bank will be discussed. Gratitude for Chinese investment in Africa has also been tarnished by a number of scandals, including the distribution of fake and poor quality anti-malarial drugs made illicitly in China and the mistreatment of workers. ""It is time for Africans to wake up to the realities of their romance with China,"" Sanusi wrote in an editorial in the Financial Times this month. ""China takes out primary goods and sells us manufactured ones. This was also the essence of colonialism."" Botswana's president recently told a South African newspaper that Chinese companies had let down his country, particularly over a power generation project. Khama added that other African leaders shared his concerns. But Adams Bodomo, African Studies director at Hong Kong University, says claims of neo-colonialism are overblown and that China's influence ""was more positive than negative."" According to Xinhua, 85% of the staff employed by the more 2,000 Chinese companies operating in Africa were Africans. ""In 10 years, China has built a lot more infrastructure than, for example, Britain did in my own country -- Ghana -- for 100 years,"" Bodomo said.","China's new president seeks to address unease over trade .

"Chinese state media have been having their fun with America's protracted attempts to stave off a crippling default - even though it will likely come back to haunt them. Cartoons depicting the U.S. as a beggar and on a life-support machine have been cropping up in publications this week as the Republicans and Democrats scrambled to agree an extension to the debt ceiling before tomorrow's deadline. A Chinese minister has also accused the 'gentlemen' on Capitol Hill of showing little concern that their 'monkey business' had been damaging America's reputation around the world. Default dig: Cartoons like this one depicting the U.S. begging have been cropping up in Chinese state media . Mei Xinyu, who works in the Commerce Ministry and advises the Chinese government, warned that China will likely buy fewer U.S. Treasury Bonds to limit its exposure to the world's largest economy. It has already invested $1.3trillion in American debt. He told CBS News: 'Average Chinese believe (their) government is able to handle this situation and won't let it shipwreck China's economy.' President Barack Obama talks with (from left) House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Representatives James Clyburn and Xavier Becerra during an Oval Office meeting yesterday to discuss the debt crisis . Debt fears: A graph showing the increase in US debt since 1980 . Michael Pettis, an American finance . professor at Peking University, said: 'If we were to see uncertainty in . the U.S. economy drag through into November and December, and that . caused Americans to cut back on the amount of purchases they would have . normally done for Christmas, than that would affect the Chinese economy . directly.' Financial markets had taken the prospect of a U.S. default in their stride - a confidence that proved to be well placed when the Republicans finally allowed the Democrat bill to go through, avoiding a default. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 174 points, or 1.2 percent, to 15,342 in early afternoon trading, following the announcement. Financial markets continued to take the prospect of a U.S. default in their stride today . The two houses of Congress still needed to vote on the deal, but signs were that it had enough support to go through, ending the weeks-long standoff and reopening the government. But the same issues - funding the government and raising the debt ceiling again - could come back in January and February, unless Democrats and Republicans agree before then on a long-term program to cut the deficit. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell announced a plan that would fund the government through January 15 and allow the Treasury to increase the nation's borrowing authority through February 7. Both the Democrat-controlled Senate and Republican-controlled House of Representatives must approve the plan, which President Barack Obama would then sign before Thursday's deadline for Congress to increase the federal debt limit.","Cartoons in Chinese state media ridicule US attempts to raise debt ceiling .

"By . Adam Crafton for the Daily Mail . Mathieu Flamini believes Arsenal are finally getting to grips with the perils of life on the road in the Barclays Premier League after the Gunners rallied to hold Everton to a 2-2 draw at Goodison. The Londoners were humbled 3-0 on this ground late last season and looked to be heading for further embarrassment on Merseyside after Seamus Coleman and Steven Naismith gave Everton a two-goal lead going into the break. But, after Aaron Ramsey cut the deficit after 83 minutes, substitute Olivier Giroud headed a late equaliser from Nacho Monreal's cross. Scroll down for videos... On the road: Mathieu Flamini claims that Arsenal have learned how to play difficult away games . One downbeat note for the Gunners was the half-time substitution of Chilean Alexis Sanchez, their £35million summer signing, who manager Arsene Wenger felt 'struggled with the physicality' and which saw the lively Giroud brought on. But French midfielder Flamini said: 'We've learned a lot from last year about playing these kind of teams away and we came back today and tried to be stronger. 'We didn't give up until the last second so it was a game to remember for us. It was a great performance from the team because being 2-0 down was not easy for us. Even though we were losing in the first half we had a few occasions to score so it was a bit unfair for us.' Hope: Aaron Ramsey collects the ball after scoring late to bring the score to 2-1 at Goodison . Game changer: Olivier Giroud came off the bench to score the equaliser before a late ankle injury . Meanwhile, Arsene Wenger praised Giroud for changing the game after coming on as a second-half substitute. 'We looked much more dangerous (after Giroud came on),' the Arsenal manager said. 'I knew we were dominating the game in the second half and we needed some physical presence up front. That presence was very important. 'He had a very good second half.' Unfortunately for Wenger, Giroud suffered an ankle injury in the dying minutes and could now miss the second leg of Arsenal's Champions League play-off against Besiktas. 'It is a big game and I hope we have not lost him,' said Wenger of Giroud, who left Goodison Park with a protective boot on his left foot. 'In the final minute he stretched his ankle. At the moment it doesn't look too good. ' Not fit enough! Alexis Sanchez was withdrawn at half-time after an ineffectual performance . Sanchez is likely to lead the line against the Turks, who gained a 0-0 draw against the Gunners in Istanbul on Wednesday. Wenger said he had no option but to withdraw the £35million signing at half-time on Saturday. 'At the moment he is not completely ready physically,' Wenger said. 'He knows he is not at his best physically but when he is his confidence will come back.'

"Her role as Lieutenant Uhura in Star Trek inspired the first black astronaut to fulfill her dreams of working with Nasa. But Nichelle Nichols might have left to pursue a career on Broadway were it not for the intervention of a very unlikely Trekkie - Dr Martin Luther King Jr. Although he's best known for his rousing speeches promising a future of freedom and equality for downpressed African Americans, it transpires the civil rights leader also had in mind a far more distant future. Trailblazers: Nichelle Nichols is pictured left as Lieutenant Uhura, on board the Star Ship Enterprise. She nearly left the role after the show's first season until Dr Martin Luther King, right, persuaded her to stay . 'He said, ""You have one of the most important roles, this is a first. It's non-stereotypical, it's brilliant, it's beauty and it's intelligence"",' Nichols told Neil DeGrasse Tyson, the astrophysicist and broadcaster. 'He said, ""You cannot leave, do you understand? It has been heavenly ordained. This is God's gift and onus for you. You have changed the face of television forever."" Now 82, Nichols 1966 debut on Star Trek as a black woman playing an educated character was groundbreaking for its time. It was the era of the Black Panthers, and of race riots in Watts, Newark and Detroit, as black communities fought to realise the potential of the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts passed to enshrine equality in law. Nichols pictured in 2010: Her 1966 debut on Star Trek as a black woman playing an educated character was groundbreaking for its time . But even with all the turmoil of the age, Nichols hadn't fully grasped the racial and cultural implications of her Star Trek role, still thinking of herself as just a cast member on the show. In fact, she had already decided to move on from the role and even handed her letter of resignation to producer Gene Roddenberry when she met King. 'I had been invited as a celebrity guest at a NAACP fundraiser in Beverly Hills,' she told Tyson, in the interview first aired in 2011 but still available on his website. 'One of the promoters came up and said someone wanted to meet me. He said he's your greatest fan ... I'm thinking it's a Trekker, maybe a child, maybe a young man. 'And so I turned and I see this man across the room with this brilliant smile, which you didn't often see on his face. And I remember saying to myself, 'Whoever this little Trekker is they're going to have to wait because this is my leader, Dr Martin Luther King, walking towards me with a smile on his face."" 'And he walks to me and with this smile he says, ""Miss Nichols, I am your greatest fan.""' Nichols says King spoke to her about her role in Star Trek and how important it was to the future of the civil rights movement. He praised Roddenberry, the producer, as a visionary, adding 'we [black people] are there, because you are there.' Said to be one of the first black women to appear in a major television series in a role not portraying a servant, Nichols did prove to be an inspiration to a generation of young people. Mae Jemison, an American doctor who became the first black woman in space on board the Space Shuttle Endeavour in 1992, has said she was she was inspired to join Nasa by Nichols' portrayal of Uhura. And Nichols is also credited with having the first interracial kiss on network television, with William Shatner's Captain Kirk, during a 1968 episode of the show. Groundbreaking: Nichols is also credited with having the first interracial kiss on American network television, with William Shatner's Captain Kirk, during a 1968 episode of the show .

She is credited with helping to recruit Dr Sally Ride, the first American female astronaut, and United States Air Force Colonel Guion Bluford, the first African-American astronaut.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:02 AM on 20th December 2011 . Digging deep: Britain's charity was revealed at a time when the Government are introducing austerity measures at home . Britain has been rated the world’s fifth most charitable country. It moved up from eighth place last year in a study of 153 nations carried out by the Charities Aid Foundation. The U.S. came top of the World Giving Index 2011 – which ranks nations based on how likely citizens are to donate money, volunteer their time and help strangers – followed by Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. The Netherlands was sixth, with the top ten completed by  Canada, Sri Lanka, Thailand  and Laos. Despite the squeeze on income, 79 per . cent of Britons give money to charity each month, up from 73 per cent . in 2010, according to the research. This is at a time when the Government . has controversially vowed to maintain levels of overseas aid despite . austerity measures at home. The survey found that only Thais were more generous than Britons, with 85 per cent likely to make a regular charitable donation. Ireland and the Netherlands were jointly third on 75 per cent. Some 28 per cent of the UK population volunteer time each month (down from 29 per cent last year) and 63 per cent help a stranger (up from 58 per cent). Worldwide there was a 2 per cent increase in people helping strangers and a 1 per cent increase in volunteering over the past 12 months, but a 1 per cent drop in giving to charity, the study based on Gallup polling data discovered. John Low, chief executive of the Charities Aid Foundation,  said: ‘It is amazing that during these tough economic times an overwhelming majority of the UK population gives to charity. ‘It shows just how deep-seated the idea of charity and charitable giving is in our society. 'However, there is always more that can be done. Creating an even stronger culture of giving in the UK will require ongoing commitment and effort by Government, business and charities.'","U.S. tops league, UK moves up from eighth .",a352c58bc07c607ee445c3ab83201c7be2bc529e
"By . Joel Christie . Kwasi Enin has a very tough decision to make. On March 27, as tens of thousands of the country's university hopefuls similarly waited patiently at their computers for news - if any - that their applications were successful, the 17-year-old from Long Island, who had already been accepted early into Princeton, got into Brown. And then Columbia. And then Cornell, Yale and Dartmouth, too. 'I was like - this can't be happening!' Kwasi told Newsday. Scroll down for video . Now that's high achievement: Kwasi Enin, 17 a senior at William Floyd High School in Shirley, New York, applied to all eight Ivy League Universities - and was accepted by the lot . Harvard University - a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts - has an acceptance rate of only 5.9 per cent, meaning only 2,023 of the 34,295 applicants will get in. They accepted Kwasi Enin . By 5pm, he had six Ivy League colleges offering him a place at their institutions, and then the toughest of them all, Harvard, sent the William Floyd High School student an email. The university has an acceptance rate of only 5.9 per cent - meaning only 2,023 of the 34,295 applicants will get in - and they wanted Kwasi. Cornell, similiarly, accepted only 14 per cent. So what makes Kwasi so desirable as a freshman? With an SAT score of 2,250 out of 2,400 - which places him in the 99th percentile for all students taking the exam - as a competitive shot putter he is also a star athlete. He also sings and plays viola for the school orchestra. Kwasi is a first generation American from Ghana. His parents, both nurses, moved to New York in the 1980s. His father, Ebenezer Enin, said Kwasi - who wants to study medicine - was raised to strive for excellence. 'He's an amazing kid. He's very humble.,' Mr Enin said. 'He's been trained to be a high achiever right from when he was a kid. 'We have been encouraging him to be an all-around student. So far, he has proved himself.' Kwasi Enin matriculated at William Floyd High School, a large school on Long Island, New York. His principal said that, from the start, it was clear he would succeed . According to USA Today, Kwasi's feat is extremely rare, with few students even able to apply to all eight Ivy Leagues, because each seeks different qualities in their students. 'My heart skipped a beat when he told me he was applying to all eight' says Nancy Winkler, the guidance counselor at William Floyd. In 29 years as a counselor, she says, she's never seen anything like this. 'It's a big deal when we have students apply to one or two Ivies. To get into one or two is huge. It was extraordinary.' Kwasi's success is the third big college announcement highlighting Black male excellence in recent weeks. Another success story: Avery Coffey, 17, a senior at D.C.'s prestigious Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, applied to five Ivy League schools and was accepted to all of them.

"By . David Wilkes . A fox in the hen house is usually a recipe for disaster. But having crept into a coop while its eight residents were pecking about outside, this cunning customer just curled up on a nest of their eggs for a nap. Maybe he was tired and it was the closest thing he could find to a feather bed, or perhaps he was slyly dreaming of a chicken omelette for tea. Pupils found this rather cosy-looking fox keeping a nest of freshly laid eggs warm in their school chicken coop . Whatever the reason, once snugly ensconced he was not going to be henpecked into leaving. He . barely batted an eyelid when pupils found him lying there when they . went to collect the eggs from their primary school’s chickens during . lunch break.

Chickens continues to scratch around in the garden outside while the creature happily kept their eggs warm . Mrs France, 57, said: ‘The chickens . were quite happily scratching around in the garden – oblivious to the . fox.’ Staff later moved the creature on and all the eggs were still . intact. 'I don't suppose I'll ever take another photo like that! Mrs France said the pupils ran excitedly into her office to tell her about the bizarre sight. She added: 'The children who saw the fox were amazed that they had got so close to a wild animal. 'As . luck would have it, my camera was on my desk as I had earlier taken . some staff photos so I took the camera with me to have a look.

"(CNN) -- There was no winner in the Mega Millions lottery Friday, pushing the jackpot to $550 million, lottery officials said. That drawing will be Tuesday. The winning numbers for the $425 million Mega Millions were: 19, 24, 26, 27, 70 and Mega ball 12, lottery officials said Friday. The Mega Millions jumped to more than $400 million, rolling over for the 20th time after no winner was picked in Tuesday's drawing. Odds of getting all six numbers correct for the second-largest Mega Millions jackpot are about 1 in 259 million, according to the lottery company. You have more than 1,000 times better chance of an asteroid or comet killing you -- and that's using the long odds, according to Tulane University. Which is to say, astronomical. The latest probability is up from the old odds, which were about 1 in 175 million. Of course, you'd probably have a hard time telling this to the trio from Illinois, Kansas and Maryland who split the record $656 million kitty last year. It's worth mentioning that you have a one-in-15 chance of winning something, even if it's just getting your dollar back, while the odds of winning the second-place $1 million prize (that is, matching five balls but not the megaball) are about 1 in 18.5 million. Those numbers are hard for the average person to fathom, so maybe it's easier if we provide you a list of things that are way more likely than collecting a Mega Millions jackpot. From the Harvard School of Public Health: . • Chances of dying from a bee sting: 1 in 6.1 million. • Chance you will die from being struck by lightning: 1 in 3 million. From the University of Maryland Medical Center: . • Chance of having conjoined twins: 1 in 200,000. From U.S. Hole in One, which insures golf prizes for holes in one: . • The chance of an amateur golfer making a hole in one on a par-3 hole is about 1 in 12,500. • The chance of a golfer hitting a hole in one on consecutive par-3 holes: 1 in about 156 million. From a 2011 State Farm study on collisions between vehicles and deer: . • The chance of hitting a deer with a vehicle in Hawaii, the state where State Farm says deer-vehicle collisions are least likely, is 1 in 6,267. From the National Weather Service: . • The chance of being struck by lightning over an 80-year lifetime: 1 in 10,000. From the Florida Museum of Natural History, based on U.S. beach injury statistics in 2000: . • Chance of drowning and other beach-related fatalities: 1 in 2 million. • Chance of being attacked by a shark: 1 in 11.5 million.

"David Cameron has piled the pressure on the growing crisis in Tony Blair’s reputation by calling for an end to hold-ups in a long-delayed report on the Iraq War. The former Prime Minister has been accused of trying to delay publication of the Chilcot Inquiry over well-sourced reports that it will  savage his handling of the conflict. Now Mr Cameron has stepped into the dispute by making it clear Sir John Chilcot’s findings should be made public as soon as possible. Tony Blair, pictured answering questions in 2010, has been accused of trying to delay publication of the Chilcot Inquiry . It follows claims that Mr Blair and Labour hope to delay the report until after next year’s General Election, arguing any criticism of the last Labour Government could hit Ed Miliband’s hopes of success. ‘The PM believes there is no excuse for any further lengthy delay in publishing Chilcot,’ said a No 10 aide. ‘It would be unreasonable to postpone it beyond the next Election.’ The controversy comes as Mr Blair faces an increasing struggle to retain his standing. The Mail on Sunday’s disclosure of his weekends with Rupert Murdoch’s wife Wendi Deng – and the role it played in the Murdochs’ divorce – damaged his personal image. His reputation as a statesman and businessman has also come under heavy fire. A recent speech, during which he urged Britain to set aside its differences with Russia to fight radical Islam, was dismissed as ‘embarrassingly simple-minded’ by some experts. It led to some questioning how long he can continue as the West’s envoy to the Middle East. And an attack on Mr Blair by his biographer Philip Stephens, published on Friday by the Financial Times, claimed he had built up a £100 million fortune since leaving Downing Street in 2007 in his ‘lust for personal riches and attention’. One of the main bones of contention over the report into the conflict (pictured) is private notes between Blair and the then US President George W. Bush . Friends of Mr Blair fear that with his overall reputation in the balance, public condemnation by Chilcot will be the last straw. A former Labour ally said: ‘Since leaving Downing Street, Tony has managed to remain a big player on the world stage and use it to earn money, justifying it by doing good work at the same time. ‘It has served him well, but it is  all starting to collapse. If Chilcot points the finger of blame squarely at him, which Blair himself knows full well it will, the whole edifice could crumble. That is why it is in his interest that Chilcot should be delayed for as long as possible.’ Mr Blair has dismissed the inquiry, saying ‘going back’ over events will not help Britain solve the Middle East crisis, but he denies blocking it. One of the main bones of contention is private notes between him and the then US President George W. Bush, which show the decision to go to war was taken long before Mr Blair indicated the measure publicly. Concerns: Friends of Mr Blair fear that with his overall reputation in the balance, public condemnation by Chilcot will be the last straw . Chilcot wants to publish the notes and told Mr Cameron last year that it was ‘regrettable’ this had not been agreed. Mr Cameron said he hoped for a resolution ‘as soon as possible’. Mr Blair’s camp is resisting, arguing it would compromise future prime ministers and presidents. There are claims that former barrister Mr Blair and his advisers are challenging every detail raised by Chilcot and his panel of experts. Mr Cameron can expect little support from the current Labour leader in bringing forward Chilcot. Even though Ed Miliband has disowned the Iraq War, strategists fear it will remind voters of the last Labour Government’s record on Iraq and cost them votes.","Former PM accused of trying to delay publication of Chilcot Inquiry .

"By . Becky Evans . PUBLISHED: . 04:56 EST, 7 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:20 EST, 8 May 2013 . The Japanese division of lingerie maker Triumph International has unveiled an 'Abenomics' bra, a special edition it says offers a 'growth strategy' and a potential lift towards Japan's elusive inflation target. Launches of Triumph's concept bras in Tokyo have become a regular event over the past quarter of a century and are an important publicity tool for the 127-year-old, Swiss-headquartered company. The latest 'Branomics Bra"" follows earlier solar-powered, recycled and 'husband-hunting' models but, like its predecessors, will not go on sale. Models present lingerie maker Triumph's new concept underwear, the 'Branomics Bra', during its unveiling in Tokyo today . The bra is nspired by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's moves to stimulate inflation, dubbed 'Abenomics' Triumph has created a brassiere that features a rising trendline and arrows as motifs and promises a 2 per cent increase in volume with extra padding . The 'Branomics Bra' is a playful take on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's 'three-arrow' economic revival plan that combines monetary strategy aiming to reach 2 per cent inflation in two years and pro-growth reforms. It features a rising trendline and arrows as motifs and promises a 2 per cent increase in volume with extra padding. 'We hope that, as the Japanese economy grows, we can also help bust sizes to get bigger,' said Triumph spokeswoman Keiko Masuda. Its benefits for Japan's policymakers were less clear. Meanwhile, Japan's Nikkei surged above 14,000 for the first time in nearly five years today. The index jumped 2.8 per cent to break the benchmark for the first time since June 2008 after aggressive new policies to try to revive the stagnant economy. The Nikkei was up 389.22 points by the midday break after closing for public holidays on Friday and Monday. Japan's Nikkei topped 14,000 for the first time since June 2008 after a strong show from the export sector . Of the 65 Nikkei companies that have reported quarterly earnings so far, 54 per cent of them either beat or met market expectations, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. Japan's economy was helped by the yen weakening further against the U.S. dollar, which was a boost for the export market. It has weakened 22 per cent against the dollar since mid-November, while the Nikkei has jumped 63 per cent after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe began promising to revive the economy. His expansionary monetary and fiscal policies were dubbed 'Abenomics' during his election campaign. Last month, the Bank of Japan announced a radical monetary expansion campaign that doubled the money supply. A rise in export sales, particularly to the U.S. and China, also boosted the Nikkei companies. Japanese exporters led the rally, with . Toyota Motor Corp, Sony Corp, semiconductor equipment maker Tokyo . Electron Ltd and Suzuki Motor Corp up between 4.5 and 6 per cent. The yen has further weakened against the U.S. dollar, which will also help exporters . Sony was the most traded stock on the main board by turnover, while Toyota took third spot. Stefan Worrall, director of equity cash sales at Credit Suisse, said Tuesday's rally mirrored the trend in overseas markets in the last few days while Japan was on holiday and may not last the rest of the week. 'The question is ""where to now?"",' Worrall said. 'We still have the majority of corporate earnings to come through in the next two weeks.' JPMorgan said it expected the Nikkei to trade around 14,150 based on the correlation between the yen/won exchange rate and Tokyo index. The yen hit a more than five-year low of 11.0057 won on Tuesday. Elsewhere, the FTSE 100 was 6.7 points ahead at 6528, following a strong performance from Asian markets. Last week, the European Central Bank cut interest rates to an all-time low of 0.50 per cent which have encouraged the markets.

Moussavi says the results were rigged. Obama has said Iranians must be free to demonstrate peacefully, and his administration Wednesday withdrew invitations to Iranian diplomats around the world to attend U.S. embassy Fourth of July parties.

"Italian officials are seeking a staggering £177m (€220m) in damages from a cruise line company after two popular tourist regions suffered a major blow following the Costa Concordia disaster. Tuscany's government wants £25m (€30m) in compensation from Costa Cruises, a unit of Carnival Corp., arguing that its image has been tarnished and tourism has declined significantly. And a separate claim by the island of Giglio, where the 950-ft-long cruiser ran aground in January 2012, has been put in for £152m (€190m). Scroll down for video . Two huge compensation claims have been filed against Costa Cruises over the January 2012 disaster . The case against Costa Concordia captain Francesco Schettino, who faces multiple charges, is ongoing . The government of Tuscany says its image has been tarnished and tourism suffered . The Costa Concordia was carrying more than 4,000 passengers and crew when it struck rocks off the Tuscan island of Giglio and capsized, killing 32 people. The ship remained partially submerged near the port of the holiday island for more than two years before being raised and towed away this year in one of the largest and most complex maritime salvages ever completed. According to a statement, Tuscany's president, Enrico Rossi, announced that the region was filing a compensation claim, telling a court in the city of Grosseto: 'We will ask Costa for €30m in damages to Tuscany's image.' Thirty-two people died after the Costa Concordia ran aground off the island of Giglio in January 2012 . The mission to upright and salvage the ship will reportedly cost hundreds of millions of pounds . The ship has been  towed to a port in Genoa for scrapping . Mr Rossi said the region had registered a decline in tourism, and that Giglio alone had lost 45,000 visitors due to the disaster. A consultant to Giglio's local government, Carlo Scarpa, asked the same court for £152m (€190m) in damages, according to a source present during the proceedings. The two officials spoke during an ongoing trial against Costa Concordia Captain Francesco Schettino, who is being tried for multiple charges, including manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship. Underwater footage shows the remains of the cruise liner as it was submerged off Giglio . The eerie footage  gives a haunting insight into the last moments of the luxury cruise ship . The stricken ship has been moved to Genoa, where it is being dismantled and sold for scrap . Mr Rossi told court: 'To reconstruct the image of Tuscany as a top tourist destination will require years of work, substantial investments and costly national and international advertising campaigns.' Costa Cruises last year avoided a criminal trial by agreeing to pay a €1m fine to the Italian state, but victims and local administrations have pursued damages separately. Shortly after the shipwreck, Costa Cruises also agreed to pay about €11,000 to each of the passengers for items lost and any psychological damages to those who suffered no physical injuries.","Tuscan officials demanding £25m claim tourism been harmed .

A friend told VSD: 'She has not been doing well since the birth of Guilia. She had baby blues, which have now become presidential blues. 'And she has only one subject of conversation - the journalists which caused Nicolas's defeat. 'That's all she speaks about. She says she has never seen front pages so insulting as those that Nicolas was subjected to during his campaign.'

Bruni herself said on France 5 television during Mr Sarkozy's election campaign: 'The journalists have been deplorable, and very aggressive with him. 'The level of criticism and lies reached incredible levels. 'But I suppose that's the freedom of the press for you. It makes me think it would be better to be living in a dictatorship.' Bruni and Sarkozy are currently living in her £3million Paris townhouse, where he has taken up a £10,000-a-month post on France Constitutional Council, the country's highest legal body, and she is planning to return to her career as a pop singer.","Child will be her second with Nicolas Sarkozy, 56 .

"By . Ryan Lipman . Australian tech entrepreneur Mike Cannon-Brookes has been forced to apologise after an employee said a software program was his girlfriend and listed some of her negative attributes. Mr Cannon-Brookes rose to prominence after he co-founded Atlassian, a $3.5 billion enterprise software company that develops products for project managers and software developers, in 2002. But after engineer Jonathan Doklovic described software program Maven as a 'demanding', 'complaining' and 'interupting' girlfriend, Mr Cannon-Brookes had to excuse his employee's comments, reported The Sydney Morning Herald. Maven: The negative comments about the software program were made during a presentation by engineer Jonathan Doklovic in Berlin on Wednesday . The remarks were made by Mr Doklovic during a presentation at Atlassian's two-day developer conference in Berlin on Wednesday and have cast a shadow over Silicon Valley. The 'demanding' software the engineer referred to is a program capable of standardising and simplifying projects built with software language Java. In his power point presentation, Mr Doklovic, who was hired by Mr Cannon-Brookes, said the software looks beautiful, complains a lot, demands, interrupts me when I'm working and doesn't play well with my other friends. He did not acknowledge that the Hebrew meaning of maven is someone who understands, based on accumulating knowledge and information. But the comments proved controversial and have seen intense backlash on social media including Twitter and also from the media. 'We are sorry': Entrepreneur Mike Cannon-Brookes, pictured, wrote an apology in response to his employee's comments . The outrage triggered Mr Cannon-Brookes to make a written apology entitled On failing our values, our team, and our industry, on Atlassian blogs. 'Today one of our engineers delivered a presentation that contained inappropriate content at our AtlasCamp developer conference,' Mr Cannon-Brookes wrote. 'We are sorry for having allowed this offensive slide into an AtlasCamp presentation. The content does not reflect our company values – nor our personal values as co-founders and individuals. Quite simply, it’s not OK. 'Sexism is a difficult issue for the tech industry, and today we didn’t make it any better.' Mr Cannon-Brookes states that immediate action is being taken, but does not mention if Mr Doklovic will be fired for the incident. He also defended the employee in question. 'I know the engineer responsible well. I hired him. I know the slide does not reflect his values any more than it reflects Atlassian’s, and he is as deeply sorry as we are. It was an error in judgment, but one the company shares responsibility for making.' Backlash: People took to Twitter to express their anger of the comments . The apology goes onto to say Atlassian has failed as a team and together they will help the engineer learn from his mistake. Mr Cannon-Brookes concludes by saying Atlassian has strived to create a diverse team environment. 'Clearly today we let ourselves, our team and our industry down. We’ll continue striving, growing and learning,' he finished. The latest scandal is the first in a long line of sexist controversies, including a pitch by two Australians at last year's  TechCrunch start-up conference, where they outlined their idea for an app called 'Titstare', which 'takes photos of yourself staring at tits. Just days later Business Insider chief technology officer Pax Dickinson was fired after he defended the actions of the two Australians. Last month co-founder of GitHub, a coding website used by software developers globally, was forced to resign after he made errors of judgment in relation to accusations of sexual harassment by a female engineer who resigned. Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel also apologised after offensive emails about women from his time at university surfaced.","Mike Cannon-Brookes has said sorry for an employee's sexist comments .

"The UK authorities ‘failed to act’ to save children from sex abuse on the British territory of St Helena and took 12 years to order an independent inquiry, according to new claims. The Government was told child abuse on the South Atlantic island was being routinely ‘ignored’ as long ago as 2002 and that men who abused youngsters were in some cases let off with a fine of £50. But the Foreign Office disregarded warnings that the island simply ‘couldn’t cope’ with the scale of the problem. The UK Foreign Office disregarded warnings that child abuse was being routinely ‘ignored’ on St Helena and that men who abused youngsters were in some cases let off with a fine of £50 . The explosive claims come from Ivy Ellick, a retired head of public health and social services on the island. She claims she told the British government that the South Atlantic Island did not have the resources to protect children there. But nothing was done and in the years between her warning and the start of the inquiry last year at least another 20 children were sexually abused on the island of 4,500 people. Mrs Ellick, who was awarded an OBE in 2004 for her 46-year career in the St Helenian government claims, numerous abusers evaded justice because of the slowness of the authorities. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, she said: ‘They [the Foreign Office] were aware that we didn’t have the resources to cope with it because we’ve been pointing it out ever since. I said they were unfair to expect us to do it without the resources. ‘We did have some convictions of child abuse but some of them didn’t reach conviction because we didn’t have the resources to do proper investigations. The police weren’t equipped enough, they didn’t have all the tools that were necessary. ‘People were actually brought to court but once they were before the judge the case got thrown out on technical points. It happened on a couple of occasions when I was in the health and social services department.’ It wasn’t until 2014 that the British government launched an inquiry, headed by Sasha Wass, the QC who prosecuted Rolf Harris, after whistleblowers detailed abuse and an alleged cover-up by the island’s government and the Foreign Office. Last night, a Foreign Office spokesperson said: ‘We take all measures of child abuse very seriously. Where we could act, we believe we have. ‘In recent years, we have sent police to provide training, investigate cases and look at the effectiveness of policing on St Helena. ‘In 2013 the FCO sent a child safeguarding NGO to St Helena to investigate child protection and there have also been visits from other child safeguarding experts. The FCO has also dedicated extra resource to child safeguarding. ‘However, we know from the current allegations that there is more to do to make sure that children on St Helena are given the right level of protection.’","UK 'failed to stop St Helena sex abuse' says former head of health .

"New York (CNN) -- Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced Thursday that some city snow plows will be fitted with global positioning systems in a pilot program meant to better track sanitation vehicles as officials brace for a winter storm. ""It gives us the ability to check on the location and progress of our snow plows,"" Bloomberg told reporters, saying that the devices will be added to some trucks in New York's Brooklyn and Queens boroughs where heavy snowfall last month left many residents snowbound. The city will also deploy scout teams to transmit video images of neighborhoods back to City Hall during clean-up efforts, the mayor said. He added that John Doherty, Sanitation Department chief, has made management and personnel shake-ups in Brooklyn following sharp criticism for the city's slow reaction to the holiday blizzard. That response has prompted an investigation into whether sanitation workers intentionally delayed clean-up efforts over frustrations of demotions and citywide budget cuts. ""These are only initial improvements,"" Bloomberg said. ""Certainly not the last word on the subject."" He said Department of Investigations Commissioner Rose Gill Hearn is also conducting an independent review over allegations of a slowdown. Joseph Mannion, president of the Sanitation Officers Association, said there was no coordinated effort to deliberately delay clean-up efforts among supervisors. The association later posted comments, saying: ""When you look around your neighborhood and wonder what the heck happened with the City's snow fighting ability you don't have to look any further than City Hall."" The heavy slow hampered morning commuters, delayed first responders and even prevented aircraft service personnel from reaching airports where 29 international flights were stuck on the tarmac for more than three hours, officials said. On Wednesday, Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano replaced the man who led the Emergency Medical Service after 170 ambulances became trapped during the blizzard. ""This city will be better off with a different person in charge,"" the mayor said. The states of New York and New Jersey had loaned the city 35 ambulances to help reduce the backlog of emergency medical services requests during the storm. In one instance, a newborn died in Brooklyn after the mother waited nine hours for emergency responders, said Fire Department spokesman Steve Rittea. The National Weather Service has issued a winter storm watch for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut starting early Friday. Forecasters project between two and four inches of snow, with heavier amounts of snow expected over eastern sections of Long Island.","Mayor Bloomberg: Some city snow plows will be fitted with global positioning systems .

"There are those who love nothing more than the adrenaline rush of amusement park rides... and then there's this teenager. During a visit to Orlando's Magical Midway Thrill Park, the man passes out three times during a one-minute ride on the Sling Shot. In between fainting, the unnamed rider wakes up and screams in terror when he finds himself dangling 390 feet above the ground. Not for the faint-hearted! A teen passes out on the Sling Shot ride at Magical Midway Thrill Park in Orlando . The whole traumatising episode is captured on video on the ride's camera. At the start of the clip the boy, who is riding with his friend Jordan Van Schalkwyk, looks decidedly nervous as they prepare to be catapulted into the air at a g-force of 3-5Gs. The ride promises to enable you to experience total weightlessness as you are flung into the air at breakneck speed - a feeling this guy does not appear to enjoy. Scared of heights? The young man is visibly nervous at the start of the ride . For thrillseekers: The ride catapults riders 390 feet into the air with a g-force of 3.5g . As they are catapulted, he screams and squeezes his eyes shut, before suddenly losing consciousness. He is passed out for eight seconds before coming to and, seeing that he is suspended 390 feet in the air, screams in terror again before fainting for a second time. His amused friend can be seen laughing and nudging his buddy trying to stir him. 'Dude, wake up': The young man faints three times in the minute-long ride . The frightened teen wakes, briefly passes out for a third time, and eventually manages to remain conscious. Jordan, who posted the footage online, finds the experience hilarious, and comments that they have to buy the video so they can watch him passing out three times in a row. He tells the ride operators: 'Three times, he passed out! Three times!' Far from a unique reaction, there are a handful of other viral videos on YouTube which show riders passing out multiple times on the Sling Shot ride.","Unidentified rider passes out multiple times during one-minute ride .

A man who forgave his girlfriend after she nearly killed him by stabbing him in the back has now been dumped from prison. Gregory Todd, from Hessle, East Yorkshire, spent three months in hospital after Tiffany Baillie, 33, plunged a 12in kitchen knife into his back as he slept. The 49-year-old forgave her for the attack and was planning to marry her after turning up at Hull Crown Court with an engagement ring in April last year. Forgiven: Gregory Todd (left) forgave his girlfriend Tiffany Baillie (right) for stabbing him in the back, but she has now dumped him from prison . The chef however has now had his heart broken after she sent him a letter from prison saying 'it never would have worked out' and that they had been apart for too long, the Sunday People has reported. Mr Todd said: 'I was used like a fool but love is blind and I didn't see it. Tiffany has ruined my life and I will never be the same again. 'She has stabbed me in the back twice.' Baillie was jailed for three years after she admitted GBH with intent. Hurt: Mr Todd had been planning on marrying Baillie before she sent him the letter ending their relationship . Mr Todd wrote an emotional letter to the judge which was read out in court during the hearing. It said: 'She has made a big mistake that she will regret for the rest of her life. Please show compassion and allow her to prove what a valuable member of society she is and a mother to her son. She will have a husband, if you allow us to marry. I promise we won’t let you down.' Judge Michael Mettyear said: 'You must realise what you did could have killed him or caused him long-term serious injury. I will sentence you on the basis he has fully recovered or nearly recovered from the attack. The offence was aggravated by the use of a knife and the fact he was asleep at the time of the stabbing.' Following the marriage proposal, which was relayed by her barrister, Mr Todd had to wait 24 hours to be told it had been accepted in a phonecall from Newhall Prison to his home in Hessle which the couple share.","Gregory Todd spent three months in hospital but still forgave his girlfriend .

"MATT LAWTON: Malky Mackay and Iain Moody investigated by FA over 'sexist, racist and homophobic' text messages during time at Cardiff . Harry Redknapp has admitted that he gets sent 'sick' and 'stupid' text messages all the time and insists that Malky Mackay deserves his second chance at Wigan. Wigan have offered Mackay a route back into football just three months after Sportsmail revealed that the Football Association had been handed a dossier of evidence accusing Mackay and Iain Moody of sending a shocking series of racist, anti-semitic, sexist and homophobic text messages. It was a controversial decision taken by Wigan chairman Dave Whelan, but Redknapp is adamant that Mackay should be given another chance.

'I would ask people to judge me when they see me. I've apologised for my mistakes I've studied diversity and that's something that's ongoing. 'It has been a difficult period and I have made mistakes. I hope that in my time at Wigan, the people of Wigan and the supporters see who I am and see that I'm someone that desperately wants the club to do well.' Redknapp said: 'I get stupid messages from people all the time, silly jokes, sick jokes, I hate them and delete them straight away. But people do tend to do that in life, so he is not the only person who has made a mistake. 'I am sure his life has been hell for the last few months. He realises he has made a massive mistake and hopefully he will not make any more mistakes. 'I am not condoning what he done but he has got another chance. People get second chances in life.

"(CNN) -- Traversing the infamous Northwest Passage was an experience unlike any other I've been through. During a grueling 14-day expedition through the ice-strewn Arctic, our seven-man team faced challenges that not even the intense training we went through beforehand could prepare us for. It is one thing being told what the Arctic is like: seeing it and living it firsthand is quite another. The only one among us with adventure experience was Bear Grylls, our unflappable expedition leader, but by the time we finished we all felt like hardened veterans. From our start point in Pond Inlet, to the pride and relief of reaching Darnley Bay a fortnight later, the journey covered 5700 nautical miles. And if you're imagining us in an ice-breaking ship, think again. This was all done in a rigid inflatable boat, making us the first crew ever to navigate the Passage in such a vessel. As if creating that piece of Arctic history wasn't a thrilling enough prospect, the encounters the journey threw up -- from rescuing a fellow explorer (and his dog) from an ice choke, to stumbling across the possible remains of legendary Arctic explorer Captain Franklin -- made the expedition truly unforgettable. Both those incidents, however, were reminders that in the excitement and adrenaline of adventure, it is easy to forget the all-too-real dangers that the Passage has for centuries presented to those who take it on. Ice chokes, growlers (floating icebergs) and freezing winds during the day, and turbulent seas when night fell (with a member of a team knocked unconscious during a particularly heavy storm) served as a constant reminder that we were very much at the mercy of the environment. Standing guard with a shotgun during an overnight stop at Ross Point, scanning the horizon for grizzly bears, certainly brought that feeling home for me. Perhaps the most frequent emotion I felt, however, was amazement at seeing up close the reason that brought me to the Arctic in the first place. The expanses of ice-strewn water in the Passage are an incredible sight, but they are also a brutal reminder of the climate change that has so changed this landscape. There is a certain irony that the isolated seas of the Passage, the very outer limits of the populated world, should represent a universal concern for the world as a whole. In embarking on the trip, we each knew the challenges that we would personally confront, but in the shifting ice we saw a vivid metaphor for maybe the biggest challenge facing all of us. It is now almost unanimously acknowledged that industrial development and rapid population growth has modified the environment in which we live, and some of the changes in global climatic conditions are already obvious. Nowhere is this more poignant that the Northwest Passage. Until 30 years ago this series of very deep channels that wind through Canada's Arctic Islands was frozen all year round. In the last few years, however, changing climate has caused the ice to thin and melt, and during the summer months it is now possible to cross from the Atlantic to the Pacific. In 10 years, the legendary Passage could be open sea . This is why Future Capital Partners decided to back the expedition. Whilst raising awareness about the effects of global warming and fundraising for charity, we hoped we were also able to promote the role of businesses in reversing -- or at least slowing down -- the global warming process. Crossing the Northwest Passage you understand why this is just the beginning of what has to be done.","Expedition through Northwest Passage showed declining glaciers .

Printed on fine art cotton paper the prints are limited to runs of only 280 each, making them as exclusive as the resorts they portray .

Printed on fine art cotton paper the prints are limited to runs of only 280 each, making them as exclusive as the resorts they portray.

The posters are the brainchild of vintage poster dealer Simon Khachadourian, who runs a gallery in Chelsea, London . ‘They were never made to last and print runs were often very limited so very few have survived and that has driven prices up. ‘Nowadays vintage posters are very collectable and sought after but they can sell for tens of thousands of pounds and that is beyond the means of most people. ‘Realising this we had the idea to commission artists to create a new set of winter sports posters in the same art deco style but at a price that was much more affordable.' Created with an art deco style, the adverts may look like they were created in the 1930s, but each one is a new design . Georgina added: ‘We have kept the stylised elements from that era in our posters but also brought them up to date by featuring resorts that are popular now and that perhaps didn't exist in the 1920s and 1930s. ‘The art deco winter sports posters are such an iconic look and we wanted people to be able to bring that style into their homes without breaking the bank. ‘Our posters are very popular and they sell to people all round the world.

"(CNN) -- Daniel Libeskind, the Polish-American architect responsible for the World Trade Center site's redevelopment, says his favorite building is the Military History Museum in Dresden, Germany. Originally an armory for Kaiser Wilhelm I and subsequently under Nazi and Soviet control, the Bundeswehr's main military museum survived the 1945 bombing of Dresden due to its location on the city's outskirts. ""It is an interesting project for me,"" says Libeskind, ""because now it is a museum of modern democratic Germany. How to transform it? How to create a new sense of what it means to have a military in a democracy which is controlled by the citizens?"" In Libeskind's $85 million redesign, completed in 2011, a huge wedge of concrete and steel scythes through the stone, columned building, to create something he describes as ""both disruptive of the old, but [that] also gives you a sense of how we have changed our thinking."" Watch Great Buildings on CNN's Connect the World . Born in Poland, raised under Communist regimes and the child of Holocaust survivors, Libeskind says the concept underpinning his design ""wasn't something that I had to research in libraries."" The dramatic shard, which was constructed as the building was also being restored, helps to reorient the museum's purpose. Libeskind says the new space offers visitors a chance to question ""why people participate in and organize violence, why they conform to totalitarian thoughts."" View a hi-res gallery of Libekind's 'Great Buildings' ""This space is not for weapons. It's to navigate between the horizontal world of history and the vertical world of human aspiration and understanding."" ""I wanted people to feel that sense of displacement, that space of catastrophe,"" he says. ""It's not just about weapons and rockets and tanks, it's about people's decisions, and how people view the world."" The building Libeskind most wishes he'd designed is one completely at odds with its surrounds -- the Eiffel Tower, which looms over Paris' uniformly mid-rise cityscape. ""It's a building with no function, that has no program,"" Libeskind says. ""It's completely uncharacteristic of Paris, and yet it's such a fantastic building. Today it's one of the world's most recognizable and most-visited monuments but in its day, the tower, erected for the 1889 World's Fair, was a controversial emblem of industrialization. Libeskind admires the daring of its design, which was innovative for its time, and the risks its engineers took -- ""the technology had never really been used. There is no guarantee how it would work,"" he notes -- but he also admires its poetry. ""It doesn't mimic anything. It's original. It has a spirit to it, a spirit of the unknown. And when you go see it, you still wonder, what the hell is this thing? How was it built?"" ""That defines for me what good architecture is: It's not a formula. It's not the pretty facade of the building. It's how the building transforms the city. It's changed how people view Paris."" ""All the great artists, composers and politicians hated that building. They wanted to tear it down. They thought it was the ugliest, stupidest thing. But, in the long run, it became the most beloved and most symbolic building of France, of Paris, of Europe."" Libeskind's Dresden museum was also criticized but, he says, he never doubted it. ""Once you hit on the right idea, it's not a matter of compromising. Of course, you have to be flexible to work it out, but the big idea has to be so strong, it has to go through fire and still emerge exactly how you wanted it to be."" ""If people enjoy it, the building becomes part of the city, and then people have a different idea of the city. It can have a big role in changing what the world looks like to us.""","Daniel Libeskind's redesign of the Military History Museum in Dresden is his favorite work to date .

"(CNN) -- Adly Mansour, Egypt's interim president, is reviewing a proposed protest law approved by the Cabinet that has drawn the ire of human rights groups and political factions. State media reported Wednesday the measure would have tight restrictions: . -- It requires an appeal to be handed to the Interior Ministry before any demonstration. -- It gives senior police officials the right to cancel, delay or move a protest. -- It allows for the creation of ""protest-free"" areas around public institutions. Rights groups have reacted strongly to the proposed measure. ""Resorting to the security and police solutions will lead to more failure and worsen the political conflict in Egypt,"" Gamal Eid, executive director of the Arabic Network for Human Rights, said in a statement. The April 6th movement, an influential political force deeply involved in Egypt's 2011 revolution, equated the draft law with Hosni Mubarak-era repressions, calling it ""one of the worst repressive laws constraining freedoms in Third World countries and military dictatorships."" Mubarak was removed from power in 2011 during the early days of the Arab Spring movement that swept across North African and Middle East. Tamarod, the grass-roots political faction responsible for organizing the petition campaign that led to the overthrow of President Mohamed Morsy in July by the Egyptian military, reacted to the draft law on Facebook: . ""Any law that limits the right of peaceful demonstration which Egyptians won in the January 25th and June 30th revolutions is an unjust law. Dealing with non-peaceful protest must be done without a law that is used to restrict or narrow peaceful protests.""

Police warned families on a residential street that it was a crime for their children to skateboard on the road, it emerged last night. Surrey Police officers have apologised for posting the notices through doors on a road in Thames Ditton, which left children as young as six scared that they would be arrested for playing outside. Detectives said in the letter that they were 'reminding parents and youths of their legal and social responsibilities', adding that 'playing football or other sports in the street is a criminal offence'. Notice: Surrey Police officers have apologised for posting the notices through doors on a street in Thames Ditton, which left children as young as six scared they would be arrested for playing outside . Local resident Catriona Riddell said some children on the street - which has an average house price of £770,000 - had started to go outside to play after the road was resurfaced last month. The 46-year-old mother-of-two told the Daily Telegraph: ‘Then all of a sudden parents started coming out and having a chat. It was a really lovely atmosphere - there was that sense of freedom. ‘When we received the leaflet, I think there was just sheer disappointment. It was a completely disproportionate reaction to a bunch of kids out playing.’ Mrs Riddell added that her children - Eilidh, ten, and Kirsty, eight - had not been watching TV since the road was resurfaced, and she had even started to meet neighbours from surrounding streets. Surprise: Catriona Riddell, 46 - pictured with children Eilidh (left), 10, and Kirsty (centre), 8, and husband Grahame (right), 46 - said some children on the street had gone outside to play after the road was resurfaced . She said most of the children had been playing ball games rather than skating - and added that up to 15 had been out either on Sunday afternoons or after school until around 6pm.

"A young seasonal ski worker was found dead today after being sucked into a snow clearing machine in the Pyrenees. The horrific discovery was made in the early morning in the French resort of Les Angles, which is currently packed with holidaymakers. Local mayor Michel Poudade said there was 'complete bafflement' as to what happened. 'The driver of the machine is in a terrible state, he is not coping well at all,' Mr Poudade added. The horrific accident happened in the early morning in the French resort of Les Angles (pictured), which is currently packed with holidaymakers . There was speculation that the woman, who was in her early 20s, may have been lying dead in the snow following an unrelated accident, or simply walked out of the driver's range of vision. A fleet of snow-clearing vehicles had been sent out to clear the roads of the ski resort in the early hours following heavy dumps. Nobody noticed the woman's body being sucked into the machine. The driver only made the macabre discovery when his plough's engine started to play up. He immediately called emergency services, but paramedics who arrived on the scene confirmed the woman was dead. The woman's identity or nationality has not been revealed, with local police saying 'everything is being done to contact her next of kin'. The seasonal ski worker, in her 20s, died after being sucked into a snow clearing machine in the Pyrenees (file picture) Heavy vehicles including snow clearing and snow making machines are common in modern ski resorts, but they can often cause extreme danger. In December, an inquest heard how a British university graduate died in the Austrian Alps when he crashed into a snow machine. Aleksander Owens-Thurston, 23, of Surrey, was killed in February 2014, just weeks after FI motor racing champion Michael Schumacher was placed into a medically-induced coma following a similar accident. Recording a verdict of accidental death, West Somerset Coroner Michael Rose urged further safety precautions. He said: 'This is a tragic matter. These snow making machines are increasingly used, and I suspect this year more than ever, as resorts try and have a full season and cannot afford to lose customers if there is not adequate amounts of snow. 'One finds snow making machines at many modern resorts across Europe. It seems to me that the marking of this snow making machine was probably inadequate. 'Witnesses referred to other resorts where they have bright, luminous tape and certainly a warning.I also note that the pedestal and the machine itself were padded but not the boom.'","The accident happened in the popular French ski resort of Les Angles .

"Forget global warming – the Earth may soon be plunged into a 250-year cooling period, scientists have claimed. Russian climate experts believe that every 200 years the Sun’s activity temporarily wanes and it emits less heat. They believe this ‘cooling period’ could cause the earth’s average temperature to fall by several degrees. Scientists believe that every 200 years the Sun emits less heat, resulting in a big freeze . The last time this occurred was between 1650 and 1850 – a period known as the ‘Little Ice Age’. At the time, most of Britain’s rivers would freeze over during the bitter winters. Contemporary paintings show people could even cross the Thames using ice skates. The next ‘cooling period’ is scheduled to start between 2030 and 2040. But scientists from Pulkovo Observatory in St Petersburg think the cold period is unlikely to be as harsh as the last one. Researcher Yuri Nagovitsyn said: ‘Evidently, solar activity is on the decrease. ‘In this respect, we could be in for a cooling period that lasts 200 to  250 years. Scientists at the Pulkovo Observatory say the cooling period is unlikely to be as hash as the last one . Britain may continue to experience harsh winters as the cooling period takes hold . ‘The period of low solar activity could start between 2030 and 2040 but it won’t be as pervasive as in the late 17th century.’ And Vladimir Kotlyakov, from the Russian Academy of Sciences, said: ‘There are no grounds to claim that global warming will continue till the end of this century. ‘Climate moves in natural cycles of warmer and colder, as well as drier and more humid times. ‘Early signs of cooling are already there and the trend may pick up in coming years. ‘Human activity and industrial discharges do have a great impact on the environment, but forces of nature are far more powerful.’","Russian scientists believe the Sun emits less heat every 200 years .

"The World Health Organization (WHO) has admitted it botched attempts to prevent the spread of the deadly Ebola virus and has pinned the blame on some of its own staff. In a draft internal document, the WHO said it should have recognized that traditional infectious disease containment methods would prove ineffective in West Africa because the health systems on the continent were broken. In a blunt assessment of their own failings, the document said: 'Nearly everyone involved in the outbreak response failed to see some fairly plain writing on the wall.' The World Health Organization said it should have realized that traditional infectious disease containment methods would prove ineffective in West Africa, as it had broken health systems . Dr. Peter Piot, co-discoverer of Ebola, said WHO acted far too slowly, largely because of its Africa office . It also said the heads of WHO country offices in Africa are 'politically motivated appointments' made by the WHO regional director for Africa, Dr. Luis Sambo, who does not answer to the agency's chief in Geneva, Dr. Margaret Chan. WHO is the U.N.'s specialized health agency, responsible for setting global health standards and coordinating the international response to disease outbreaks. Dr. Peter Piot, the co-discoverer of the Ebola virus, agreed  that WHO acted far too slowly, largely because of its Africa operation. 'It's the regional office in Africa that's the front line. And they didn't do anything. That office is really not competent,' Dr Piot said. Dr Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, also questioned why it took WHO five months and 1,000 deaths before it declared Ebola an international health emergency in August. 'I called for a state of emergency to be declared in July and for military operations to be deployed,' Dr Piot said. Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia are the hardest-hit nations in the current outbreak of the deadly virus . But he said WHO might have been scarred by its experience during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, when it was slammed for over-hyping the situation. In late April, during a teleconference on Ebola among infectious disease experts that included WHO, Doctors Without Borders and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, questions were apparently raised about the performance of WHO experts, as not all of them bothered to send Ebola reports to WHO headquarters. WHO said it was 'particularly alarming' that the head of its Guinea office refused to help get visas for an expert Ebola team to come in and $500,000 in aid was blocked by administrative hurdles. Guinea, along with Sierra Leone and Liberia, is one of the hardest-hit nations in the current outbreak, with 843 deaths so far blamed on Ebola. The Ebola outbreak has already killed 4,484 people in West Africa and WHO says within two months there could be new 10,000 cases of Ebola every week unless more measures to fight the outbreak are taken. Ebola is a serious infectious illness which often proves fatal - It can take up anything from two to 21 days for humans with the virus to show symptoms . Other experts said it was impossible to predict that the initial Ebola cases in Guinea would spark the biggest-ever outbreak of the lethal disease. 'There were a lot of mistakes made by WHO but a lot of the best public health minds would have thought we could handle this in July,' said Michael Osterholm, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Minnesota. 'By the time we realized how bad things were, the genie was already out of the bottle,' he said. Osterholm said the U.N. health agency was far from the only organization to blame.","World Health Organization internal document offers blunt assessment .

"A group of Texas gun owners have attempted to recreate last week's attacks on the Charlie Hebdo offices to see what would happen if one of the murdered journalists had a gun. A dozen volunteers each took turns to participate in the simulation on a set designed to replicate the offices of the French magazine. The volunteers were armed with a handgun firing bullets made of paint. Just one volunteer managed to survive after fleeing the building, two victims managed to take out a single gunman before being killed, while nine people died without injuring either of the attackers. Scroll down for video . Armed: A dozen volunteers took it in turns to be attacked while armed with a handgun and sitting on a set resembling the offices of Paris magazine Charlie Hebdo . Breaking in: The 12 were each attacked by two men with automatic rifles. Only one survived after fleeing the building, two managed to kill one of the attackers, and nine died without injuring either of them . The exercise was organised in Plano by pro-gun campaign group   The Truth About Guns. Volunteers sat in a crowded room mimicking the morning conference at Charlie Hebdo magazine where jihadi brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi  shot nine of the staff. The volunteers in Plano were asked to sit around for a random length of time, before two men armed with automatic rifles comparable to the terrorists' weapons entered the building. The pair, who had a similar level of training to that showed by the Kouachi brothers, were asked to make a small noise on their way in to give the volunteers a chance to prepare. From that point the drama unfolded without a script, with all parties firing marker rounds filled with paint to reveal which people were hit. Truth About Guns member Nick Leghorn told CBS Local: 'It’s interesting to see how people react under stress. It’s not what you’d expect people do.' Brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi killed 12 people when they attacked the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine a week ago today with Kalashnikov rifles . Nine of Charlie Hebdo's staff were murdered as they took part in morning conference (file image), a scenario the Texas simulation tried to replicate . Of the 12 people to participate, nine were killed in the office without managing to take out either of the attackers, just as the scenario played out with the unarmed journalists in Paris. Only one female volunteer managed to survive the simulation by running from the set, leaving both of the attackers unharmed. Two of the volunteers managed to take out a single gunman, as footage captured by CBSDWF.com shows. However, none of the participants were able to stop the massacre by taking out both attackers. The Kouachi brothers killed 12 people, including three police officers, when they attacked the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris a week ago today. Over the course of the next 48 hours the pair were pursued across northern France before being cornered and killed in a print works just north of Paris as they tried to return to the capital. The publication was targeted for its history of publishing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, a gesture considered highly offensive to some Muslims. Today the first issue of the magazine to be produced since the attacks, featuring another cartoon of Mohammed on the front page, sold out in France within hours of going on sale. Its usual print-run of 60,000 has been increased to almost five million in the wake of the attacks, which prompted solidarity marches around the world.","Gun group created set replicating inside of Charlie Hebdo's offices .

"Forget feminism: Laura Howard says women aren't as successful in business because they want to have children . Whether it's their views on immigration or admiration of Adolf Hitler, UKIP politicians are never far from controversy. Now a new supporter has spoken out in an attempt to refresh the image of her beloved party, although she may not have been entirely successful. UKIP follower Laura Howard has given an interview to The Debrief in which she said she hopes to debunk the myth that the party is a just 'bunch of old white men'. But in doing so, the 19-year-old student nurse from Birmingham could enrage many with her anti-feminist sentiments. She told Rosamund Urwin that she's against modern feminism because 'it’s gone almost beyond equality: they want women to have more rights than men. They want quotas for women in businesses and I don't agree with that.' She believes it isn't sex discrimination preventing women taking on more highly paid, powerful roles but their own life choices. 'I think the main reason behind that is that women want to have children and a family life,' she said of the male domination of company boards. She added that politics is also male dominated not because of a lack of opportunities for her gender, but because women are simply not as interested in it. 'If you look at someone like Theresa May, she's a really well-established politician. I just think women aren't as interested as sad as that is,' she said. Scroll down for video . Not interested: Laura says that the lack of women in politics is due to the female gender's lack of interest rather than unequal opportunities but she thoroughly admires Theresa May (pictured) The outspoken teenager's opinions echo those of UKIP leader Nigel Farage who said earlier this year that mothers are 'worth less' to employers in the City than men. He said that women can succeed in the industry as long as they are willing to 'sacrifice the family life'. Laura has been campaigning for UKIP for the last two years and stood to be a councillor in Quinton in Birmingham. She has ambitions to one day run for parliament and her converts to the party so far include many of her own family members. Mutual values: The outspoken teenagers opinions echo those of UKIP leader Nigel Farage (pictured) Where they once supported the Conservatives and Labour, she's now persuaded her parents and grandparents to vote UKIP. She said it was the party's animal rights and EU stance that attracted her to them. 'I am anti-the EU because I'm pro-democracy,' she says. She adds that she doesn't think of UKIP as far right but 'just something different.' The student believes the party has much to offer people her age as 'immigration affects jobs and house prices - those are things that really affect young people today.'

"Manchester United defender Phil Jones has turned to yoga and pilates in a bid to overcome the injury problems that have blighted his early years at Old Trafford. The England international made his latest comeback for Louis van Gaal’s team in the 3-0 Barclays Premier League win over rivals Liverpool at the weekend. Jones was rushed back ahead of schedule but came through unscathed and last night revealed he has turned to some of the game’s more modern conditioning methods as he bids to maintain fitness. Phil Jones made his first appearance since October against Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday . On Monday Jones (right) visited a children's hospital to hand out Christmas gifts to young patients . The 22-year-old tussles with Mario Balotelli as Manchester United record a comfortable win against Liverpool . ‘I started the pre-season and played every single game and every single training session,’ he said. ‘Then, on international duty, I pulled my hamstring and I have never had a muscle injury so it was disappointing. ‘When I was coming back I then had shin splints. It has been unfortunate. I have been doing a lot of work in the gym and hopefully that will stand me in good stead for the rest of the season. ‘It is strength work, yoga and pilates and loads of stuff. I will do anything I can to improve myself. People don’t wake up one morning and say, “I fancy being injured today’’. It is just the way it is. ‘My aim right now is to stay fit and stay focused and get a run of games under my belt.’ Jones slides in to challenge Liverpool's Raheem Sterling during Sunday's 3-0 Premier League win . Jones received a yellow card after sending Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho tumbling . If Jones sounds defensive about his injury record then it is perhaps understandable. Since signing from Blackburn, the 22-year-old has made a relatively modest 69 league starts in three-and-a-half seasons and has suffered more than a dozen injuries. On Sunday against Liverpool, however, he produced a performance fundamental to United’s victory. ‘The first 20 minutes were a bit of a whirlwind for me to be honest,’ he said. ‘But it was great to be back out there. ‘We know that we are not firing on all cylinders yet but we are learning and we will keep improving.’ Midfielder Ander Herrera declared his innocence int he face of match-fixing allegations . The allegations date back to the midfelder's time in Spain with Athletic Bilbao . Meanwhile, United midfielder Ander Herrera has declared his innocence in the face of allegations of match-fixing in Spain. Herrera and Swansea midfielder Jefferson Montero are among 41 players, coaches and directors named in an investigation. Prosecutors allege almost one million euros was used to pay Levante players to lose their match against Zaragoza at the end of the 2010-11 season. In a statement on his Facebook page, Herrera said: ‘I have never had and will never have anything to do with manipulating match results. If I am ever called to testify in any judicial hearing I’ll be happy to attend as my conscience is totally clear.’","Phil Jones has suffered numerous injuries since joining Man Utd in 2011 .

"Steve Harmison knew who to call when he first clapped eyes on a young, raw but gifted Ben Stokes at Durham eight years ago. ‘I’d never compare him to people who have gone before, including someone I was close to, but I remember speaking to that certain all-rounder when Ben was about 15 and the cheeky little sod had come into our dressing room,’ said one of England’s best modern fast bowlers. ‘I rang him and said, “I’ve just seen you”.’ The call was made, of course, to Andrew Flintoff, inseparable from Harmison during their England days, and the comparison has proved to be a valid one, with Stokes conjuring up echoes of the Lancastrian both on and off the pitch. Steve Harmison believes that Ben Stokes (pictured) can be as good as Freddie Flintoff for England . Stokes possesses a rare ability with bat and ball, but also a propensity to self-destruct - much like Flintoff . ‘Fred asked me what I meant,’ said Harmison, ‘and I said, “Well, he goes out to bowl with no socks on and just picks up a bat and goes out to bat”. Everything is an event with Ben and he has gone on to be a phenomenal cricketer.’ Of all the promising young players who have emerged for England in the past year, none has the potential to excite — and perhaps frustrate — as much as Stokes, who joined the team in leaving for their one-day series in Sri Lanka on Sunday. He has already shown, at 23, that he possesses rare ability with both bat and ball but also the propensity to flirt with the self-destruct button a la Flintoff, as most spectacularly shown when he thumped a locker in frustration in Barbados in March and badly broke his right wrist. Harmison (left) and Flintoff were inseparable at times during their England careers . Stokes kicks the ground in frustration during a test match against India in July . ‘Ben can be as good as he wants to be,’ said Harmison, speaking to promote Royal London’s sponsorship of the Professional Cricketers’ Association Benevolent Fund. ‘But he needs to be used in the right manner and England mustn’t stop him being the explosive, charismatic character he wants to be. Personally, I would take a bit of pressure off his bowling and put more onus on his batting. ‘I think the frustrations of playing on a big stage and then going to a smaller one can get to him. He went last winter from Australia, with everything going well for him on fast wickets, to the Caribbean on slow ones being watched by one man and his dog. That’s when frustrations come out. He’s had to learn. Because of his own doing in punching that locker he’s let in two players in Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes who are now competition for places. But Ben is one of the best young players I’ve ever seen. It’s hard to put that on one man’s shoulders but if he is batting at six and bowling well, England have a very good team.’ Stokes can be 'as good as he wants to be,' according to former England fast bowler Harmison . Stokes has also impressed for his county side Durham, pictured celebrating in September at Lord's . Harmison believes England are approaching the most intensive 18 months of cricket in their history with a bowling attack that stands comparison with the fabled quintet of Harmison, Matthew Hoggard, Simon Jones, Flintoff and Ashley Giles from the 2005 Ashes. ‘Steven Finn is the key to how England do in Sri Lanka and the World Cup,’ added Harmison. ‘I believe that, if they are all fit and firing, (Jimmy) Anderson, (Stuart) Broad, Finn, Stokes and (Moeen) Ali is as good a line-up as we had in 2005, I really do. And Finn is the key to that. ‘If he can get back to his best it makes life easier for others. And they could be better than we were because, other than Jimmy, they have youth on their side too.’","Ben Stokes possesses a rare ability with both bat and ball .

"French authorities are investigating if a woman appearing in ISIS's latest video titled Blow Up France 2 may be the wife of the Paris kosher deli Islamist- a source has claimed. The footage, released by French-speaking ISIS fighters on Tuesday, shows masked jihadists praising the attacks on Paris last month and calling on Muslims to carry out further terror attacks in France. In a chilling statement to camera, the terrorist says: 'Don’t give up and particularly don’t lower your weapons, don’t surrender, kill. Today it’s our darwa, kill them, you now have more than 4 million targets.' Scroll down for video . French authorities are said to be investigating if a woman appearing in ISIS's latest video (pictured in camouflage headgear) may be the wife of the Paris kosher deli Islamist . A source close to the French investigation into the kosher deli attacks, told CNN that authorities think the woman   in the video, seen wearing camouflage clothing and holding a weapon, could be Hayat Boumeddiene. Boumeddiene is the wife of Amedy Coulibaly, the Islamist gunman who killed four hostages at the kosher Hyper Cacher market in the eastern part of the French capital on January 9. He was killed by police following an hours-long standoff. Authorities are searching for Boumeddiene, who is also believed to have been a co-conspirator in attack. She is currently thought to be in Syria. Hayat Boumeddiene, wife of terrorist Amedy Coulibaly, is believed to have appeared in the latest ISIS video . She and Coulibaly were married in a religious ceremony, but the marriage was not officially recognized under French law. The kosher supermarket attack followed the January 8 massacre by Islamic gunmen at Charlie Hebdo, a satire magazine. Gunmen brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi killed 12 people at the  magazine's offices in Paris. The next day, a French police officer was killed. Seventeen people were killed over those three days. The massacre caused a worldwide outcry and calls for the defense of free speech after ISIS claimed the cartoonists were murdered because they published pictures of the prophet Mohammed. But in the new ISIS video, the militants claimed: . 'Where is this freedom of speech? When in 2009, the cartoonist Siné, after drawing the Jews and Sarkozy’s son, was sacked by Charb and Charlie Hebdo.' The video also calls for more attacks on soldiers and police officers in France. The jihadist calls on French Muslims to: ''Kill a cop with a knife, take his gun, with his gun kill a soldier, with his shotgun throw yourself in the way of your God.' The latest ISIS video, by French-speaking fighters, calls for more attacks on soldiers and police officers in France . Fighters praise the terrorist attacks that took place in Paris last month at the offices of satirical cartoon Charlie Hebdo and at a kosher supermarket . They go on to warn the West that they cannot expect peace from the Islamist terrorists. 'If you fight for democracy, we will fight for Islam,' they said. 'You will have to accept that we will react fully to the numerous crimes you committed. You took our rights. Therefore you can't expect to be in peace.'

"(CNN) -- Four minor boys are facing felony assault charges after a 13-year-old boy accused them of sexually assaulting him in the locker room of a Tampa, Florida, middle school, authorities said Friday. The alleged victim told school officials he was assaulted with a broomstick and hockey stick at Walker Middle School, in southern Tampa, on April 30, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office said. Linda Cobbe with Hillsborough County Schools said police were contacted Wednesday afternoon after the boy reported the incident. The four teenagers, 14 and 15 years old, were arrested at school Wednesday and charged with sexual assault and false imprisonment, the sheriff's office said. The victim said two boys held him down on the ground while the other two sexually assaulted him, the sheriff's office said. The alleged victim had been ""continually picked on and harassed by the suspects"" before the incident, the sheriff's office said in a news release. All four suspects have been suspended from school, Cobbe said. On Thursday, the school's principal, Kathleen Hoffman, contacted students' parents through a recorded message, telling them the four would not be allowed to return to school ""unless their legal issues are resolved."" Cobbe said the 13-year-old is back in classes at the school. CNN's John Couwels contributed to this report.","Boy, 13, says he was sexually assaulted at middle school .

They posted a picture of the graffiti written in Chinese online along with comments expressing their disgust at the boy's actions. 'National embarrassment': Ding Jinhao, from Nanjing in east China's Jiangsu Province, wrote: 'Ding Jinhao was here' over hieroglyphics on the wall of an ancient Egyptian temple in Luxor . The tourist, . surnamed Shen, said: 'It was the saddest moment during my stay in Egypt, . and I felt ashamed. 'We try to wipe out the shame with tissue, but . it was difficult to clear it out, and we could not use water as the . relief is a historical relic 3,500 years old. 'All of the 14 members of our tour group kept silent after seeing the sentence as we felt ashamed.' The post prompted an online search which revealed Ding's identity, his date of birth and his school in Nanjing in east China's Jiangsu Province. Shocked: Chinese tourists who spotted the graffiti posted a picture of it online alongside comments expressing their disgust at the boy's action . Public apology: The embarrassed parents of the schoolboy apologised to both the Chinese people and the Egyptian authorities for their son's actions . The parents of a 15-year-old Ding Jinhao . have since issued a grovelling national apology to their fellow countrymen over their son's behaviour. They told the Nanjing-based Modern Express newspaper: 'We apologize to Egyptian authorities and Chinese people who pay attention to the incident. 'He has realized he made a mistake, and we beg your pardon, please give him a chance to correct his act.' Many social media users in China condemned Ding for damaging the ancient relic and his parents for not educating him properly. One said: 'Ding's uncivilized behavior disgraced Chinese people.' A Communist Party official has warned Chinese tourists to behave better when abroad to stop harming China's image (file photo) It comes shortly after China introduced a . new law in April which warns against tourists committing uncivilized . behavior but does not specify punishments. Senior Communist Party official Wang . Yang, one of the country's four vice-prime ministers, has also warned that . holidaymakers should be more polite, singling out talking loudly and . spitting as poor behaviour by his fellow citizens. Writing in the official party newspaper .

"Robertsport, Liberia (CNN) -- When Alfred Lomax took up surfing five years ago, he was regarded as Liberia's first homegrown surfer. He's no longer the only Liberian catching waves, but with the sport still a niche interest in the West African country, some are touting Liberia as one of the world's last undiscovered surfing destinations. Lomax took up surfing shortly after the end of the 14-year civil war that destroyed much of his country. He says being out in the waters off the Liberian coast is like being in heaven. ""Nothing beats surfing,"" Lomax says. ""I feel so happy."" While Lomax may be a surfing pioneer in Liberia, he's not the only one taking advantage of the country's undisturbed coastline. Keith Chapman runs Surf Liberia, which promotes the country as a surfing destination. A dentist by trade, he came to Liberia five years ago after seeing the desperate need for better healthcare. He had spent four years working on a hospital ship in West Africa, attending to the needs of some of the most deprived people in the world. But he was drawn to Liberia and in 2008 the 37-year-old Texan settled there permanently with his family. Chapman and his few colleagues work long hours at a dental clinic based just outside of the capital, Monrovia. Surfing is Chapman's release. ""There's such a massive need that you could work around the clock. You need to set some boundaries,"" he says. Chapman hits the water in his spare time with a group of regular surfers at a beach close to his home. There, they can enjoy the waves without having to compete for space. ""Our surfing community is 20 at the largest,"" he says. ""In most parts of the world where they have surf this good, that's unheard of."" Robertsport is Liberia's most popular destination for surfers, with five point breaks -- locations where waves break offshore -- within walking distance of each other. Word of the uninterrupted surf is starting to filter through to tourists and some are heading to Liberia's beaches. Swiss surfer Julian Saccaron is in Liberia for six months with his surfer buddies, away from the more popular and more crowded surfing spots in Indonesia and Australia. He knows it's only a matter of time before more people discover what Liberia has to offer. ""We've already talked with each other and said just breathe it in, suck it in, because it will not be the same when we come back,"" he says. While Saccaron may want to keep the coastline a secret, local surfers hope their beaches will bring more tourists -- and more money -- to communities that currently depend on fishing for survival. But Liberia is a long way from being a mass-tourism destination. ""People are going to have to be prepared for some sort of adventure. It's not a place where you can get a package holiday,"" says Chapman. He believes it will be a while before there is a tourism boom in a country which is trying hard to rid itself of its reputation as a war-torn nation. ""I think once we get beyond that stigma, then more people will come,"" he says. ""It's still got a way to go -- public transport and roads are a bit of an issue -- but safety is not really an issue, crime is very low."" Nonetheless, the U.S. State Department urges U.S. citizens to ""exercise caution when traveling in Liberia,"" while Britain's Foreign Office advises against ""all but essential travel to all areas of Liberia outside the capital, Monrovia."" Both warn that crime is high, especially after dark. But while Liberia undoubtedly still has economic and social problems, Chapman believes surfers can help alleviate them. He encourages the surfing community to become involved in voluntary work and he hopes Liberia's waves will entice more humanitarian workers who can help to rebuild the nation. ""I'm sure there are lots of dentists out there who surf,"" he says. Lomax is hoping it's not just tourists who take advantage of his country's surf. He wants more Liberians to follow his lead and take up the sport. ""I look at all the sports in our country -- people play soccer, basketball, and surfing is not part of that,"" he says. ""So I decided I want to bring surfing to Liberia and make Liberia one of the biggest surfing countries in the world.""","Liberian Alfred Lomax took up surfing five years ago, shortly after the end of the civil war .

"(CNN) -- If Tiger Woods fails in his double bid to retain the Bay Hill title and regain his world No. 1 ranking this weekend, then it's a fair bet he'll be ruing his late lapses on the opening two days. The 14-time major winner surrendered two strokes at the last two holes on Thursday, and lost three at the final three on Friday to be four off the lead at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. ""I played way better than what I scored today,"" Woods said on the PGA Tour website. ""I missed a couple of short ones, and I had a rough finish."" It was another frustrating finish for the 37-year-old, who started the tournament in high spirits after publicly acknowledging his relationship with skiing star Lindsey Vonn. He last held the No. 1 ranking in late October 2010, having occupied it for 281 weeks before a marital scandal that ended in in his divorce. Added to injury problems, he dropped as low as 58th in the standings before resurrecting his career with three titles last year and two more this season. Woods started the second round with a promising birdie and then eagled the par-five sixth hole before picking up further shots at 11 and 13. However, it all went wrong as he bogeyed 16, 17 and 18 to drop to a tie for seventh place on five-under-par 139, having carded 70 after his opening 69. ""The good news is we've got 36 holes to go,"" said Woods, who seeking to join Sam Snead as the only player to win the same tournament eight times. ""Certainly four shots can be made up. ""I've made my share of mistakes on the last few holes the last couple days. I need to clean that up."" Alongside him were fellow former world No. 1 Vijay Singh and fellow American Mark Wilson, who both moved up from 15th overnight with their 68s. Bill Haas joined overnight leader Justin Rose at the top, with both on 135 after shooting 66 and 70 respectively. Englishman Rose dropped a shot at his final hole, while American Haas had earlier finished strongly with an eagle at 16 -- emulating Woods' opening-day effort. Haas, whose wife is due to deliver their first child in two months, is battling neck pain he suffered reaching down to pick up a towel at the Northern Trust Open. ""We should call it a sore neck, not an injury. When you're playing poorly, it hurts, and when you're playing well, it doesn't hurt,"" he said. John Huh, born in New York to South Korean parents, dropped to third on 136 after a 69, while fellow U.S. players Ken Duke, J.J Henry and Jimmy Walker were tied for fourth on 138. Major champions Ernie Els, Phil Mickelson, Webb Simpson, Lucas Glover and Trevor Immelman all missed the halfway cut along with FedEx Cup series leader Brandt Snedeker. Mickelson, who will be seeking his fourth Green Jacket at Augusta next month, shot his worst round at Bay Hill -- 79 -- as he battles to regain the form he showed in winning at Phoenix last month. ""From where it was a few months ago, where I felt so good and my ball-striking was some of the best I've ever had, it is a little surprising,"" the 42-year-old lefthander said. It was Snedeker's first start in a month following a rib injury, and he struggled with successive 76s.","Tiger Woods four shots off lead in Bay Hill title defense after more late mistakes .

"Mary Smith, 100, managed to fight off a gang of children who attacked her in a park before escaping on her high-speed mobility scooter . A 100-year-old great-grandmother managed to fight off a gang of children who attacked her in a park before escaping on her high-speed mobility scooter. Mary Smith, who is partially deaf and blind, was taking her dog and a neighbour's for a walk  in Rugby, Warwickshire, when she was attacked by the group of three or four boys. As the children, who were aged around ten, tried to drag her from her scooter and rifle through her bags, Mrs Smith grabbed her dog Xena and the other pet and drove straight at the gang, forcing them to scatter. The former Second World War dispatch rider then escaped on her high-speed scooter. Her daughter Rita Doggrell, 77, who also lives in Rugby, said her mother did not understand what was happening when she was set on by the boys. 'I can’t quite believe the lack of respect these boys showed to a woman of mum’s age,' she said. 'She had just started to go around the path and was taking her own dog and the neighbour’s dog for a walk when they just set upon her. 'Mum suffers quite badly with blindness and loss of hearing and can only really make out shapes so she couldn’t tell what was happening to begin with. 'She knows that a group of three or four young boys approached her and started trying to get her out of her mobility scooter. One of them even got onto it at one point.' Mrs Doggrell said her mother, who she described as inspirational for her age, was remarkably unshaken by the ordeal. 'Unfortunately nobody else was around to help,' she said. 'But thankfully she was able to fight them off, grab the dogs and get away from them. 'She is incredibly strong and very good for age so she just took it in her stride.

"A witness in the Oscar Pistorius trial posted a Facebook message bemoaning that his reputation was being 'destroyed' by the prosecutor - but vowed to mark the end of his testimony with a pint. Forensics expert and geologist Roger Dixon has been called to cast doubt on the prosecution's account that the Paralympian deliberately shot Reeva Steenkamp during a fight. But the former police officer found himself being repeatedly, and at times mockingly, accused of not being qualified . to give evidence by state prosecutor Gerrie Nel. After a bruising day of cross-examination yesterday, Mr Dixon wrote on his Facebook account last night that he was bracing himself for much of the same today. To make matters worse - having told the court he did not . have a television or radio and had not followed the . state’s case because it was 'better not to be influenced by external . factors' - his Twitter account was discovered, revealing that he had . re-tweeted earlier coverage of the trial.

He wrote it after being accused by the prosecutor of not being qualified to give evidence . Glib: Mr Dixon said he would mark the end of his three-stint on the witness stand by having a beer . Writing on Facebook, he said: 'Third day in court today. Let's see how much of my credibility, integrity and professional reputation is destroyed. 'It is difficult to get belief in those who will not listen because it is not what they want to hear. After that, beer!' A picture of the message - apparently shown on a mobile phone screen - was posted on Twitter this morning. Mr Dixon later confirmed the Twitter and Facebook accounts belonged to him. He is also said to have told reporters during a break in the hearing that he had been inundated with 'hate mail' because of his involvement in the case. Accused of being 'evasive': Mr Dixon holds a magazine rack as he discusses the sequence of shots that hit Miss Steenkamp when she was in the toilet . Mr Dixon has offered a different sequence . for the shots that killed Reeva Steenkamp, contradicting testimony by a . police ballistics expert and the pathologist who performed the autopsy. However, . he has appeared unsteady during his cross-examination as Mr Nel warned . him it was irresponsible to 'try and be an expert' in areas he was not. Mr Nel asserted in his . cross-examination that Mr Dixon was not an expert in light, sound, . ballistics, gunshot wounds or pathology - all areas about which he was . testifying. Mr Dixon worked . at the police forensic laboratory in Pretoria until he left the force in . December 2012. He was a specialist in analysing materials at crime . scenes.

'For an expert you are evasive,' Nel said, prompting the judge at one point to tell the energetic prosecutor to 'restrain' himself. The prosecutor also criticised Dixon for not bringing photographs and his written reports with him and abruptly told him to bring them on Thursday. 'I said I will,' Mr Dixon snapped back. 'Good,' Mr Nel responded. Nel ridiculed Dixon's finding about the sequence of the shots that Pistorius fired at Steenkamp through the door, testimony which contradicted that of a police ballistics expert and state pathologist Professor Gert Saayman.

"The website of Olympic bobsledder Justin Kripps has been censored by Russia's strict Internet laws while the Canadian is in Sochi for the Winter Games. The heavy-handed censorship has led to speculation as to whether a recent picture of Kripps and his teammates posing bare-chested may have fallen foul of President Putin's anti-gay laws. Kripps had been using the website to keep fans updated on the team's preparations for the Olympics, but when he arrived in Sochi he found access to it had been barred. Scroll down for video . Fans: Justin Kripps, left, and his teammates were voted 'Beards of the Week' by a gay blogger when the Olympic hopeful posted this picture online . When the 27-year-old pilot of Canada's three-man bobsled team tried to log into his website from his cellphone an error message, written in Russian, appeared. Kripps used an online translator to decipher the message and discovered his website had been 'restricted' because it contained information prohibited by Russian law. It is believed the ban could be related to a tweet that Kripps sent on February 6, that linked to a video mocking Russia's homophobic laws. He tweeted: 'This is pretty funny' and linked to a short film made by the Canadian Institute of Diversity as part of its Keep The Games Gay campaign. Kripps had also tweeted a team picture in January, which showed him and his bearded teammates wearing only their underpants. Error: This Russian message, blocking Kripps' website says access has been restricted because it is either breaking a law or spreading information prohibited in Russia . Going for gold: Kripps with the four-man Canadian team . The bobsledder's tweets automatically link to the news feed on his website. According to the Wire, the team picture quickly went viral on social media networks last month, and led the team to be declared 'beards of the week' by gay blogger Andrew Sullivan. It is not known if Russian censors cut access to the website because of its popularity within the gay community, but the country has strict laws governing material it deems to be 'homosexual propaganda'. Kripps told CBC the ban was 'pretty crazy'. An online translation that he did of the error message showed three possible reasons for the ban. Denied: Kripps joked on Twitter about his website being censored . The message said it could be restricted because of a court decision; a source which spreads information prohibited in the Russian federation and law; or that the website uses information from right holders that it shouldn't. Kripps took the censorship in good spirits, tweeting: 'Looks like my website is censored in Russia, haha classic #SochiProblems I wonder if there's a camera in my room.' Canadian reporters in Sochi for the Games also reported that they were unable to access the site, and a clear reason for it being blocked has not yet been given.","Justin Kripps has been barred from his own site while in Sochi .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:25 EST, 22 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 00:25 EST, 22 May 2012 . Afghanistan could slip back into the hands of extremists and pose a terrorist threat to  the West when Western troops leave, experts have warned. David Cameron claimed at a Nato summit yesterday that plans for withdrawal by the end of December 2014 are ‘on track and on target’. Barack Obama went even further, declaring that the allies would soon be able to say: ‘The Afghan war as we know it is over.’ 'The war is over': President Barack Obama, accompanied by Prime Minister David Cameron, speaking during the meeting on Afghanistan during the NATO Summit in Chicago yesterday . But despite those optimistic statements, the U.S. commander of Nato’s troops said they would have to fight their way out of the country. A senior British official also conceded that it was ‘unrealistic’ to assume Afghanistan ‘is going to be completely secure’ or that there would be ‘no possibility of a terrorist threat re-emerging’. Yesterday’s summit was designed to set out a final timetable for the handover to Afghan security forces, which will lead all combat operations by mid-2013. General John Allen said he ‘fully expects that combat is going to continue’ past that milestone. ‘There is no end of combat before the end of 2014,’ he added. ‘And in fact, the Taliban will oppose the Afghan National Security Forces after 2014.’ He went on to warn that Nato may need to send more troops to Helmand province, where British forces are currently stationed, if extremists seize ground vacated by the allies. All smiles: Mr Obama greets participants during the Meeting with Partners event at the Nato Summit. Despite his remarks, experts warned that it was unrealistic to expect Afghanistan to be completely free of terrorism . Round table: Mr Obama is seen speaking on-screen at the meeting yesterday, which was designed to set out a final timetable for the handover to Afghan security forces, which will lead all combat operations by mid-2013 . Mr Obama, presiding over a 50-nation war coalition summit in his hometown, summed up the mood by saying the Afghanistan that will be left behind will be stable enough for them to depart - essentially good enough after a decade of war- but still loaded with troubles. 'I don't think there's ever going to be an optimal point where we say, ""This is all done. This is perfect. This is just the way we wanted it,''' Mr Obama said. 'This is a process, and it's sometimes a messy process.' Afghan forces for the first time will take over the lead of the combat mission by the middle of 2013, a milestone moment in a long, costly transition of control. Even in a backup role, U.S. forces and all the rest will face surprise attacks and bombings until the war's end. War torn country: Afghan security forces rush to the site of a battle in Kabul. Even if the withdrawal goes to plan, British taxpayers will bankroll the Afghan security forces for years to come . The partners are in essence staying the course on Afghanistan. They stuck with a timeline long established and underscored that there will be no second-guessing the decision about when to leave. Questioned about what will happen if Afghanistan eventually falls apart, Mr Obama signalled that there is no turning back. 'I think that the timetable that we've established is a sound one, it is a responsible one. Are there risks involved in it? Absolutely.' Unrest: Hundreds of protesters, many affiliated with the Occupy Wall Street movement, demonstrate in front of the Boeing headquarters on the second day of the NATO summit yesterday . Mr Cameron insisted that British troops will have completed their mission and can leave ‘with their heads held high’ – but he conceded that Western leaders would not control the country’s fate. ‘British troops will no longer be in a combat role beyond the end of 2014,’ he said. ‘That is our deadline. And at this summit, Nato confirmed it will be the deadline for the ISAF [International Security Assistance Force] mission. 'The plan for the transition of full security responsibility from ISAF to the Afghan National Security Forces is on track and on target.’","'The Afghan war as we know it is over,' declares President Obama .

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- Five militants were killed in the volatile eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk on Monday after they took part in a large coordinated assault on a border guard base, an official at the Ukrainian State Border Guard Service told CNN. Also Monday, the White House announced Vice President Joe Biden would lead a U.S. delegation to Ukraine to attend the inauguration of Petro Poroshenko as president on Saturday. The attacks in Luhansk began early Monday when least 100 militants tried to storm the border unit on the southern edge of the city, said Oleg Slobodyan, the spokesman for the Ukrainian State Border Guard Service. The guards repulsed the first few attacks, but then the militants changed positions and began to shoot from inside nearby buildings where local people live, Slobodyan said, adding that the attackers weren't letting residents out of their homes. He said border guards were refraining from returning fire because they didn't want to cause civilian casualties. As of 9 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET), an estimated 500 militants were still attacking the base, Slobodyan said. Fighters observed a roughly 20-minute truce in the afternoon for the removal of injured militants and border guards, the border service's website said. Five militants were killed and eight were wounded in the fighting, Slobodyan said. Eight border guards have also been wounded in the fighting, Slobodyan said. It was not immediately possible to independently confirm the casualty numbers. Video from the scene shows at least one rocket landing on the edge of the compound. The separatist unrest that has gripped Ukraine in recent weeks has been centered in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Ukraine's military sent air support for the border guards Monday, but residents' proximity to the guards' base ""limits the full-scale use of the military aviation,"" said Vladislav Selezhnev, a spokesman for the Ukrainian government's Anti-Terrorist Operation. Still, the military was able to take out two mortar sites from the air, he said. Meanwhile, seven people were killed Monday by an explosion at the regional government building in Luhansk, health officials said.

"If you’re lucky enough to look about 18, there’s a good chance you’ll be asked to provide ID at the supermarket to buy alcohol, knives or glue. Now an addition has been made to that list of potentially hazardous items – chocolate pudding. Robert Nemeti was amazed when he was asked for ID while buying a microwaveable pudding at Tesco. Proof is in the pudding: Shopper Robert Nemeti was stunned when he was asked for ID as the dessert posed a risk to the roof of his mouth . Mr Nemeti, 24, was going through the . self-service checkout when an on-screen warning announced that his . purchase had to be ‘approved’. A member of staff at the store in Southampton hurried over and asked Mr Nemeti to produce identification. When asked why, the female assistant told him that the Cadbury Hot Chocolate Pudding would get hot when cooked and may burn him. Mr Nemeti, a photographer, yesterday described the policy as ‘crazy’ health and safety. He said he did not have any ID on him because he had just ‘nipped to the shop to buy something sweet after work’. Tesco said the machine should not have requested proof of age for the dessert (file picture) A member of staff at the store in Southampton demanded Mr Nemeti produce identification showing he was over 18 . Luckily the shop worker approved the . purchase anyway, saying she was satisfied he looked old enough to be . trusted with the £1 dessert. Mr Nemeti, from Southampton, said: ‘I . scanned through a pint of milk without any problem and then the pudding. ‘The machine beeped, flashed up a warning on the screen and an annoying automated voice warned “approval needed”. ‘I only bought two items – and they . weren’t alcohol, cigarettes, solvents or sharp – so I was clueless as to . why they would need approval. The 24-year-old described the request for his age as 'health and safety gone mad' ‘The woman who was monitoring the . self-service checkouts came over and asked me for identification showing . I was 18. I asked her why and was stunned when she told me: “It gets . hot when you cook it – and you may burn yourself”. Surely the same can . be said of many of the products they sell in any supermarket? Health and . safety has gone crazy if you now have to prove you can be trusted with a . chocolate pudding.’ He added: ‘I explained that I didn’t . have any ID. Thankfully she agreed that I looked over 18 and she scanned . her staff pass to approve the sale.’ Mr Nemeti managed to cook and eat the dessert that evening without injury.

"(CNN) -- A seven-year-old boy who spent a winter's night lost in chilly conditions in the Australian bush says a friendly kangaroo is the reason he survived. South Australian police said Simon Kruger went missing in the Deep Creek Conservation Park, south of Adelaide, after wandering away from a family picnic shortly after 1.15pm Saturday. A search party of about 40, including two rescue helicopters, was mobilized to locate Simon, who was wearing just a fleece top and track pants and was not equipped for a night in the elements. The search party continued their efforts through the night, operating using parachute flares, before a rescue helicopter spotted him about 500 meters from where he had gone missing nearly 24 hours earlier. He was winched to safety shortly after noon Sunday, a police spokesman told CNN, having sustained minor injuries from his night in the wilderness. But what has drawn the most attention about the episode is Simon's account of how he survived. ""Dad, I'm okay - I slept under a tree and there were kangaroos,"" were his first words to his father as he was reunited with his family, The Australian newspaper reported. His father, Etienne, told Australia's 7 News said that his son had been picking flowers for his mother when a kangaroo approached him. ""A kangaroo came closer to him and ate the flowers from him, and the kangaroo fell asleep next to him,"" Etienne Kruger told the network. ""I think God sent a kangaroo to keep him warm."" The boy's mother, Linda Kruger, added: ""I think it was a miracle, when I smell his jacket, it's kangaroo -- bush and kangaroo."" The Krugers had been confident throughout the search that their son would be found safe, with the father telling The Australian that his son was strong and resourceful. He told the Daily Telegraph newspaper Monday that his son was recovering well from his ordeal, and acting ""as if nothing had happened."" ""He's had a nice shower last night and a good sleep,"" he said. ""He's certainly got something to tell at show and tell now.""","Boy, 7, says kangaroo helped him survive a chilly night in the Australian bush .

Tributes: Warrant Officer Class 2 (WO2) Ian Michael Fisher from the 3rd Battalion The Mercian Regiment (Staffords) who was killed in a suicide blast while on patrol in Afghanistan . A ‘hugely experienced’ British . soldier killed in a suicide attack in Afghanistan was named last night . as Sergeant Major Ian Fisher. The married father of two died when a vehicle packed with explosives rammed his Warrior fighting vehicle on Tuesday. The . 42-year-old officer had been deployed to the warzone in August. He was . on his second tour of  Afghanistan and had also served in Northern . Ireland and Iraq. Warrant Officer Class 2 Fisher, 42, was on the final day of a two-day operation to disrupt insurgent activity near Kamparak, 25 miles north east of the provincial capital Lashkar Gah when the attack took place. He was taken to the military hospital at Camp Bastion but later died from his injuries. Yesterday, his widow Emma paid tribute to the father-of-two. She said: 'Ian will always be the centre of my . life, he will be remembered as a doting father, loving husband and a . true professional soldier. 'He loved being a soldier, that's what he lived for. We are all so proud and always will be.' His death takes the number of UK . service members who have lost their lives since operations in . Afghanistan began in October 2001 to 446 and he is the eighth to die this year. WO2 Fisher, who worked as a Sergeant Major for a company of Warrior fighting vehicles, was a physics and geology graduate, who was born in Barking in Essex. He joined the Territorial Army in February 1993 with B Company, 3 Staffords, based in Stoke-on-Trent. He completed four previous operational tours from 1999 - once to Northern Ireland, twice to Iraq and a previous tour of Afghanistan in 2011. As well as his wife Emma, he leaves behind two sons, James, seven, and William, five, and his parents, Simon and Helen. The Ministry of Defence said that WO2 Fisher's colleagues described him as 'the epitome of an Infantry Sergeant Major, straight talking and obsessive in his pursuit of excellence and gaining the most from his subordinates while ensuring their wellbeing'. Casualties: The latest death takes the number of UK service members who have lost their lives since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001 to 446 and he is the eighth to die this year (file picture) Lieutenant Colonel Chris Davies, Commanding Officer of WO2 Fisher's regiment, said: 'To lose a soldier in combat is a tragedy that hits any unit hard but to lose a warrant officer of WO2 Ian Fisher's calibre and standing in such a tight knit family regiment is a huge blow that has left the whole battalion numb. 'Qualified in both light role and armoured iInfantry, it was his expertise on Warrior fighting vehicles that set WO2 Fisher apart from his peers and for which he was widely respected as one of the best of his generation across the Army. 'Ian will always be the centre of my . life, he will be remembered as a doting father, loving husband and a . true professional soldier.' Emma Fisher . 'His reputation as a tough-talking, no-nonsense sergeant major belied his quick wit and mischievous sense of humour and his men loved him for it. 'A larger-than-life character, he played a pivotal role in battalion life, always at the forefront where there was fun to be had. 'His nickname of ""the Colonel"" epitomised him. He was the consummate professional, never happier than when leading from the front and making things happen. Hugely popular, he is already sorely missed.' Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'It is with great sadness that I learned of the death of Warrant Officer Class 2 Ian Fisher. 'It is clear from the tributes from his colleagues that he was an exemplary soldier who made a huge contribution to the Army over many years, on a number of operational tours.

A former TV weatherman has been found guilty of sending hundreds of sexually explicit texts to a teenage boy. Rob Lopicola, 43, was found guilty yesterday on one count of using text messages to solicit sex and another count of computer pornography and child exploitation, and could now face up to 20 years in jail. Lopicola, who worked at WPTV-Ch. 5 in West Palm Beach until his unexplained exit in 2006, was acquitted of another charge of having oral sex with the then-15-year-old in October 2010. Rob Lopicola, seen here in the dock before a day of his trial, has been convicted on one count of sending sexual text messages to a child and another of computer pornography and child exploitation . Fall from grace: the former WPTV weatherman could now face up to 20 years in jail when he is sentenced . During his trial Lopicola dismissed the messages he sent in the months after the alleged meeting as 'fantasy fun', claiming they were part of a harmless 'fetish'. But state prosecutor Michael Kugler heavily criticised his two-hour appearance on the stand, telling jurors Lopicola had used his on-camera skills to 'schmooze' them. Lopicola said he had met the boy through a classified advert on Craigslist, and believed he was over 18 when he started messaging. The presenter, who also spoke about his battle with alcohol addiction, said he thought the boy was pretending to be young for the sake of the fantasy. Lopicola is also facing a separate charge of unlawful sexual activity with a 17-year old . Lopicola was acquitted of performing oral sex on the 15-year-old after arguing that he contacted him through a Craigslist advert and had never met the boy . However Ms Kugler pointed out that, whether Lopicola knew the boy was underage or not, he had still committed a crime. Kristy Militello, defending Lopicola, said that the boy had encouraged him by sending flirtatious text messages back, and criticised the teenager for deleting the messages from his phone. The boy, now 18 and attending a school in Georgia, said he sent the messages out of loneliness and denied suggestions he was trying to set Lopicola up. Lopicola, who remains in custody in Palm Beach County Jail, is also charged with unlawful sexual activity with a 17-year-old in a separate case which will be heard on Monday. A weekend forecaster for nearly eight years, Lopicola covered some of the biggest weather events in the past decade, including hurricanes Frances, Jeanne, and Wilma in 2004 and 2005. 'I have spoken in front of a lot of people when I was a weatherman,' Lopicola told the jury. 'I'd get a little nervous — but this is a terrible feeling.' Sentencing has been adjourned until December 6 when Lopicola faces between 34 months and 20 years in jail.","Rob Lopicola, 43, guilty of sending sexual messages to 15-year-old boy .

'This has been the absolute best day of my life since I've been doing news.' Indeed, the Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey Office said in a Monday release 'This afternoon, Deputies responded to Saturn Elementary School after School Administrators reported the child had left the campus. The administrators advised the child has existing medical conditions and was not in possession of required medications. 'Aviation Units, K9 Units, and Agents from the Brevard County Sheriff's Office immediately responded to assist in the search. During the efforts, Media Helicopters also responded to the area and assisted in trying to help locate the missing child.

"It is a terrifying moment for any man - as they lean down on one knee and fumble to open that tiny velvet box... their whole future dependent on the answer to a four-word question. But now it has become clear just how risky proposing to the woman you love really is. A new survey has shown that nearly one in four women have turned down at least one marriage proposal during their lifetime. A new survey has revealed that one in four women have turned down a marriage proposal in their lifetime, with the top reason being that the man wasn't 'The One' (picture posed by models) The most common reasons are because they feared the proposer wasn't 'the one', that it 'didn't feel right' or that their partner wasn't taking the proposal seriously enough. Others even said they have rejected a proposal because they thought it was nothing more than a joke. But 23 per cent of people who have declined a proposal admitted they'd regretted the decision later on. It also emerged 59 per cent of men feel nervous at the prospect of proposing to their partner, with 15 per cent admitting that the thought made them break out in a cold sweat. Almost one in three women also revealed that they would turn down a marriage proposal if the man hadn't gone to enough effort while popping the question (pictured posed by model) One man even recorded his own heart rate leading up to, during and after proposing during a break to Rome, with his pulse spiking at 131 beats a minute as he got down on one knee. A spokesperson for travel firm SuperBreak, who commissioned the research, said: 'We realise that proposing is a big decision for most people and the survey results clearly show this. 'It can take a long time to pluck up the courage to pop the question and to not hear the answer you are hoping for can be difficult. 'And it seems many women will turn down a proposal simply because it wasn't done in the way they were hoping. 'So if you are planning to propose, make sure you have an idea of what your partner would like and hopefully you will be celebrating hearing 'yes'.' Of the 2,000 Brits questioned over their proposal experiences, 37 of women revealed they had been proposed to  twice in their lifetime and 12 per cent admitted men had asked for their hand in marriage no less than three times. 1. I wasn't certain they were the one . 2. It just didn't feel right . 3. I don't/didn't want to get married . 4. It didn't feel like they meant it . 5. I didn't think we'd been in a relationship long enough . 6. We'd already split up and they were trying to win me back . 7. I was worried about what other people would think . 8. I didn't think we could afford it . 9. I thought it was a joke . 10. I didn't think my partner was taking it seriously enough . While issues over the condition of the relationship were most likely to solicit a 'no' from the woman in question, the research has shown that the effort that goes into the proposal is also a big factor. 29 per cent of women admitted they would turn down their partner just on the basis of the proposal itself being poor. 52 per cent revealed they were hoping for a traditional 'down on one knee' proposal and 20 per cent wanted an 'all-singing, all-dancing' proposal. It also emerged just 22 per cent of men actually planned to, or did, spend the traditional two months' salary on a ring for their partner. One in ten men don't intend to spend a great amount on a ring saying that they 'don't see the need for a ring.' The study found the most romantic destinations for proposing to a partner are Paris, Venice and Rome.","Survey shows quarter of British women have refused a marriage proposal .

As of 8 p.m. ET, the center of Hermine, downgraded to a tropical depression, was about five miles (about eight kilometers) southwest of Brady. Its maximum sustained winds were at 35 mph (55 kph). It was moving north at about 20 mph (33 kph). However, Hermine still packed enough of a punch to cause flooding in the San Antonio area. Between 1 and 3 inches of rain an hour fell over the city, according to CNN meteorologists, citing weather radar. Hermine could drop between 4 to 6 inches of rain on portions of the state and prompt flash floods, forecasters said. Isolated tornadoes were possible overnight. Portions of Interstate 35 were closed because of flooding over the road in San Antonio, according to the Texas Department of Transportation. At least 22 other roads also were closed by high water, said Melissa Sparks of the San Antonio Fire Department. Strong wind blew off the roof of an apartment complex, said Laura Jesse of the Bexar County fire marshal's office. There were no reports of injuries. ""It's rain and a lot of wind,"" said CNN iReporter Caroline Radtke of San Antonio, who shot a video of the weather spawned by Hermine. ""I'm still wet from it."" She shot her video around noon, and nearly two hours later said, ""It's almost worse now."" Hermine made landfall slightly over the Mexican border near Brownsville, Texas, on Monday night. ""It was pretty loud last night,"" said CNN iReporter Jeremy Williams of Weslaco, Texas, about 45 miles northwest of Brownsville. He said the gusts began to calm about 2 a.m. or 3 a.m., ""but for a while, it was just pounding winds."" He said gusts of up to 60 mph were reported about 20 miles to the east, in Harlingen. A wind gust of 56 mph was reported at Kingsville, Texas, just before 7 a.m. ET, forecasters said. Footage from CNN affiliate KTRK in Galveston, Texas, showed huge waves hammering the coastline. A storm surge was forecast to raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet along southern Texas, forecasters said. Water levels were gradually receding, but will probably remain above normal for the next day or so. Tropical storm-force winds extended outward up to 45 miles from the center of the storm. Williams said he did not lose power, but others in the Rio Grande Valley did. As of about 11 a.m. Tuesday, he said, ""the skies look really clear"" and the sun was out, with temperatures in the mid-80s. ""It's actually really nice out today,"" he said. Joseph Tomaselli, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Brownsville, said flooding and fallen trees, signs, power lines and power poles were reported in Brownsville and Cameron County on Tuesday morning. CNN's Sean Morris and Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","NEW: Hermine downgraded to tropical depression .

"(CNN) -- ""New Moon,"" the latest film in ""The Twilight Saga"" is doing record business at the box office. In its opening weekend the film grossed $140.7 million -- more than any other film with an autumn release in history. The tales of teenage vampire love based on the best-selling books by Stephanie Meyer have wooed film-goers without having to resort to acres of flesh being on display. This distinct lack of on-screen sex runs contrary to the popular trend of portraying teenagers on screen as playing fast and loose with their virginity and affections. Love and the importance of relationships most definitely rule in ""The Twilight Saga"" and the formula is proving popular with audiences. Elizabeth Morowitz, Communications Professor at the University of Missouri and author of ""Bitten By Twilight"" thinks that this more sensitive approach is the key to the film's success. ""A lot of people ask 'what's so appealing about the Twilight and why is it popular now?' and we think it's because of the relationships and the messages about love in Twilight. In a more conservative environment we've had this push for abstinence education, so we now have a media message that's more congruent with that. So perhaps some teens relate to it in that way,"" Morowitz told CNN's Katie Walmsley. The director of ""New Moon"" Chris Weitz says that sexual abstinence is central to the film's appeal. ""It's not that they can't have sex, they choose not to and I think there's so much popular culture that's saying to young people: 'you'll be cool if you have sex' or 'it's important to be sexy' whereas this series really concentrates on matters of the heart and spirit and I think that's lovely,"" Weitz told CNN. A dashing male lead, in the shape of Robert Pattison doesn't hurt either when you're trying to attract a female teenage audience. But whatever the exact recipe for its undoubted success it looks like teenagers in the ""Twilight"" world don't like to bite off more than they can chew.","""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" is breaking records at the box office .

"Jermain Defoe is closing in on a return to English football as part of a swap deal involving Sunderland misfit Jozy Altidore. Gus Poyet has been working on a deal to end Altidore’s nightmare at the Stadium of Light by allowing him to leave the club and move to Major League Soccer side Toronto as part of a swoop for Defoe. Poyet is desperate to add firepower to Sunderland’s strike force and Defoe has pedigree in the Premier League after spells at West Ham United, Tottenham Hotspur and Portsmouth. Lazar Markovic nonchalantly trots away after giving Liverpool during their 1-0 victory at Sunderland . Jermain Defoe is closing in on a return to English football with a move to Sunderland . Defoe (right) has been training with former club Tottenham Hotspur and wants to return from the MLS . Black Cats misfit Jozy Altidore (right), pictured against Chelsea in November, could move the opposite way . 1 - Sunderland have won just once at the Stadium of Light all season and have the worst home record (nine points) in the Premier League. The biggest stumbling block to Defoe’s return remains his £70,000-a-week wages but the potential to trade Altidore has softened the financial burden for the Black Cats. Toronto had been holding out for a £6million transfer fee for the former England striker but are tempted by a straight swap provided Sunderland take on his massive wages. Defoe, 32, has been training with Tottenham’s Under 21 development squad to keep fit recently and, although there is no prospect of a deal at Spurs, he has no intention of heading back to Canada for the start of the MLS season in March. Markovic poked beyond Costel Pantilimon to score his first goal since moving to the Premier League . Emre Can grabs hold of Markovic as the Liverpool players rush to congratulate the goalscorer . How Poyet could have done with the former England striker in his ranks on Saturday as Liverpool coasted to victory without their own talisman. Brendan Rodgers did not want to expose Raheem Sterling to the coarse climes of the North East, where temperatures barely touched three degrees Celsius and wild winds whipped litter around the stadium. Instead, the player he believes will fire Liverpool to the top four was in Jamaica, relaxing and posting selfies amid the 30-dgree Celsius surrounds of his ‘winter break’. Liam Bridcutt was given his marching orders four minutes after half-time for two bookings . Bridcutt tripped Can as he marauded down the right into space to pick up his second yellow card . Rodgers said: ‘He will come back now and mentally it will freshen him up. It is not just the physical fitness but the mental fitness that he needs.’ The only surprise at the Stadium of Light was that Liverpool did not add to Lazar Markovic’s ninth-minute opener, a close-range poke after a forceful run into the penalty area. Sunderland, in comparison, lacked energy and invention, although they were arguably better after Liam Bridcutt was sent off early in the second half following a soft second booking for a trip on Emre Can, but they never truly threatened parity. Former Manchester City winger Adam Johnson smashed the bar in the second half for Sunderland . Markovic later struck the crossbar with this volley as Liverpool took control of the game in the North East .","Jermain Defoe could join Sunderland with Jozy Altidore moving to Toronto .

We've all been there: the annoying moment when your iPhone goes off and you're busy doing something else. You stop what you're doing, reach into your pocket or bag, and by the time you've pulled out the phone, you're too late to draw your finger across the screen and answer the dratted thing. Well, if you thought YOU were annoyed by missed calls, you obviously weren't as annoyed as this Japanese man. Scroll down for video . No more missed calls: The Japanese inventor demonstrates how his gadget works . As this hilarious footage (see below) shows, he has devoted serious thought to the first world problem of missed iPhone calls. Obviously inspired by the quick-draw technique of gunslinging cowboys in Western movies, the young man has designed a holster for the iPhone that can, apparently, be strapped to the limb of your choice. The YouTube clip shows a detailed drawing of the holster, which seems to be an iPhone holder attached to an extending plastic arm that you strap to your arm or leg. When the phone rings, you flick your wrist and the arm shoots out, bringing your phone to your ear in a second. When the phone is not in use, it remains hidden up your sleeve. On the clip, the man demonstrates in agonising detail how the quick draw holster works. How it works: A drawing shows the design of the iPhone gadget . Moshi-moshi? The inventor answers his phone within seconds . Gunslinger: The man appears to have modelled his design - and technique - on quick-draw cowboys in Westerns . Shoots from the sleeve: The iPhone is always close to hand . In a variety of increasingly bizarre locations (sitting on a loo, leaping backwards onto his bed, lying beside a toy train track on a building's roof), the inventor shows how the iPhone can be at his ear almost immediately it rings. He looks extremely pleased with himself as he stares into the camera. His invention does not always work perfectly, though, with the iPhone flying out of its holder and across the room on a couple of occasions. You can wear it on your leg... Or on both legs, should the mood take you . Why he felt the need to test his gadget on top of a tall building while lying next to a train-set is anyone's guess, but it hasn't harmed the ratings, which were pushing 1,000,000 this morning, two days after the clip was posted on YouTube. Most of the comments posted by viewers were positive, but not everyone was so impressed. One person wrote: 'Someone needs a girlfriend.'

"(CNN) -- Brazil have moved to the top of South American qualifying for the 2010 World Cup finals after thrashing Uruguay 4-0 in Montevideo, their first victory in the country for 33 years. Brazil players celebrate Juan's second goal in their 4-0 thrashing of Uruguay. Barcelona full-back Daniel Alves gave them an 11th-minute lead with a speculative long-range effort that goalkeeper Sebastian Viera allowed to bounce over him and into the net. Roma defender Juan headed home the second goal 10 minutes before the interval and Sevilla's Luis Fabiano added a third early in the second half, although he was later sent off. In-demand AC Milan playmaker Kaka completed the victory from the penalty spot after he had been fouled in the area. The win sees Brazil move onto 24 points, level with former leaders Paraguay who relinquished top spot after a shock 2-0 home defeat at the hands of Chile. Goals from Matias Fernandez in the 12th minute and Humberto Suazo in the 50th gave Chile a crucial win, lifting them up to third place -- just a single point off the top two. Argentina complete the top four, another point behind on 22 points, after a 56th-minute Daniel Diaz goal gave them a 1-0 home victory over Colombia in Buenos Aires. With only the leading four teams guaranteed a place in South Africa next year, fifth-placed Uruguay now appear to have a mountain to climb, as they trail Argentina by five points with just five matches remaining.

"(CNN) -- The defense attorney appointed to represent an Alabama professor accused of shooting her colleagues said Friday he regrets describing her as ""wacko."" But at a news conference, Roy Miller said ""something's wrong with this lady."" He also said his client, Amy Bishop, is ""aware of what she's done and she's very sorry for it."" Bishop is under suicide watch in jail, Miller said. In an interview Thursday with CNN affiliate WHNT after visiting Bishop, Miller said, ""I just think the case speaks for itself."" He added, ""I think she's wacko."" At Friday's news conference, he referred to that remark. ""Good lord, y'all,"" Miller said. ""Listen, I went overboard with that. When I talk to y'all I make statements ... I wish I hadn't have made. And probably that's one of them."" He added that he was trying to imply that the facts of the case ""speak for themselves."" Bishop told him she does not remember the incident, Miller said. But now, ""she knows she's killed some folks, I'm sure."" The biology professor is charged with capital murder and three counts of attempted murder in the shootings at the University of Alabama in Huntsville last week. At the end of a biology department faculty meeting at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, Bishop suddenly ""just stood up and shot,"" a professor who survived the incident told CNN affiliate WAAY. Three of Bishop's colleagues were killed; three others were wounded. Bishop, a Harvard-trained geneticist, had recently been denied tenure. Bishop, a professor and researcher at the university, was arrested as she was leaving the building. A 9 mm handgun was found inside, on the second floor. A university spokesman, Ray Garner, identified the dead as Gopi Podila, chairman of the biological sciences department; Maria Davis, associate professor of biology; and Adriel Johnson, associate professor of biology. Miller said his client is ""trying to keep from cracking up down there emotionally,"" and is worried that if she breaks down, officials in the jail might think she's going to commit suicide. Discussing his client's mind, he said that doctors of biology ""have got, in my estimation, high IQs -- and the high IQ in my opinion is sometimes not good for people."" He said Bishop sometimes is ""so focused on the mental basis"" that she ""does not know what's going on around her."" He said he believes the case will boil down to Bishop's mental state at the time of the killings. In the wake of the shootings, information came to light about previous run-ins with the law Bishop had. She faced criminal charges after an altercation at a Massachusetts restaurant nearly eight years ago, police said. The police report says Bishop became furious that there was no booster seat available for her child, began screaming at the woman who had taken the last one and struck her in the head. Authorities previously have said Bishop, who is also known as Amy Bishop Anderson, fatally shot her brother in the family's Braintree, Massachusetts, home in 1986. The shooting was ruled accidental, but after a review of the incident after the Alabama shootings, Norfolk County District Attorney William Keating issued a statement saying that probable cause had existed in 1986 to charge Bishop with assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a dangerous weapon and unlawful possession of ammunition. However, the statute of limitations on those charges has expired, as well as on a potential charge of ""wanton and reckless conduct"" -- the lowest standard for manslaughter in Massachusetts, Keating said. In addition, the Boston Globe reported Monday that Bishop and her husband, Jim Anderson, were questioned in the 1993 attempted mail bombing of a Harvard Medical School professor. Jim Anderson said on Monday that federal investigators had gathered ""a dozen subjects"" in the attempted bombing, but ""there were never any suspects. Never anyone charged, never anyone arrested.

Misao Okawa, 115, will turn 116 on Wednesday and she is the world's oldest person . Mrs Okawa, from Osaka in Japan, will turn 116 on Wednesday - she was born in 1898. When she was born, Queen Victoria was on the throne and the Spanish American War was raging, The Telegraph reports. She told the paper: ‘Eat and sleep and you will live a long time. You have to learn to relax.’ Mrs Okawa, whose husband, Yukio Okawa, died in June 1931 – 83 years ago, has been the world’s oldest person since the death of 116-year-old Jireomon Kimura in June 2013. He remains the world’s oldest ever man. ‘Mrs Okawa eats three large meals a day and makes sure that she sleeps eight hours a night,’ Tomohito Okada, the head of the Kurenai retirement home where she lives, told The Telegraph. He added: ‘She insists that her favourite meal is sushi, particularly mackerel on vinegar-steamed rice, and she has it at least once every month.’ Mrs Okawa (pictured on her 115th birthday) says the key to a long life is eating well and getting lots of sleep . Mrs Okawa is also known to have made every attempt to stay active for as long as possible. When she was 102 she was found doing leg squats ‘to keep her body in shape’. Mrs Okawa says that the happiest moments of her life were her wedding and the birth of her three children – she still has a surviving son and daughter who are now 94 and 92. Her children have also given her four grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. She says the saddest moment of her life was the death of her husband. Experts say it is no surprise that both of the last two oldest people have been Japanese. Mrs Okawa recommends that people eat sushi, learn to relax and that they sleep for at least eight hours a night . They say it is down to an excellent healthcare system, encouragement to stay active in old age and a healthy diet made up of fish, rice and fruit.

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- An American father jailed in Tokyo has been harshly treated, his attorney said Monday, while Japanese authorities said he is getting ""special"" treatment. Christopher Savoie is in jail in Japan after trying to get back his son, Isaac, and daughter, Rebecca. Attorney Jeremy Morley, in a statement released Monday, said Christopher Savoie -- accused of trying to kidnap his children after his ex-wife took them to Japan -- is being held without trial, interrogated without an attorney present and denied needed medical treatment for high blood pressure.   Savoie has also been exposed to sleep deprivation, and denied private meetings with attorneys and phone calls to his wife, according to Morley, who said the way his client has been treated amounts to ""torture.""   He acknowledged that some of the claims are based on second-hand information from Savoie's wife, Amy, saying she has communicated with people familiar with her husband's case. Police in Yanagawa, a rural town in southern Japan where Savoie is being held, denied the allegations in Morley's statement, saying Savoie gets regular visits by a physician and medicine as prescribed. A Yanagawa police officer, who declined to give his name citing departmental policy, told CNN that Savoie, like any other detainee, has a ""dim"" light in his cell for safety, and is assured to get 8 hours of sleep a day. Savoie is being questioned -- with an interpreter -- within the boundaries of Japanese law, which allows for suspects to be interviewed without the presence of an attorney, the officer said. The law also permits several rounds of questioning for hours on end, the officer said. The officer said Savoie is allowed ""frequent"" visits with his defense attorney in Japan and is generally given ""special"" treatment due to the nature of his case, the officer said. ""If you call this 'torture,' what can we say?"" the officer said. Savoie, 38, a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen, allegedly abducted his two children -- 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca -- as his ex-wife walked them to school on September 28 in Yanagawa. With the children, Savoie headed for the nearest U.S. consulate, in the city of Fukuoka, to try to obtain passports for them. Screaming at guards to let him in the compound, Savoie was steps away from the front gate but still standing on Japanese soil when he was arrested. Savoie and his first wife, Noriko Savoie, were married for 14 years before their bitter divorce in January. The couple, both citizens of the United States and Japan, lived in Japan, but had moved to the United States before the divorce. Noriko Savoie was given custody of the children and agreed to remain in the United States. Christopher Savoie had visitation rights. During the summer, she fled with the children to Japan, according to court documents. A U.S. court then granted Christopher Savoie sole custody. Japanese law, however, recognizes Noriko Savoie as the primary custodian, regardless of the U.S. court order. The law there also follows a tradition of sole-custody divorces. When a couple splits, one parent typically makes a complete and life-long break from the children. Complicating the matter further is the fact that the couple is still considered married in Japan because they never divorced there, police said. And, Japanese authorities say, the children are Japanese and have Japanese passports.","Official in Japan denies ""torture,"" says dad is receiving ""special"" treatment .

This week, Apple reached out to residents of Cupertino, California, where its current headquarters resides (and will continue to after the new campus is built). In a letter obtained by blog 9to5 Mac, the company seeks to allay some concerns that its neighbors have expressed since the plan was submitted to the city last summer. Former Apple employee explains 'upside-down' logo . According to the letter, the four-story building will be a research facility that will not replace the existing campus on 1 Infinite Loop. And it will not be open to the public, so there will be no museum or corporate store. The building will contain an auditorium that seats 1,000 and will be used for special events like product unveilings, though. The letter, from Apple Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer, says the company plans to break ground on the site as soon as Cupertino gives its approval, which is expected this year. Neighbors are invited to send Apple a letter or go to the city's website to express any concerns. In the suburban city of roughly 58,000 people, the primary concerns have focused on additional traffic and environmental impact, both of which Apple says it is addressing in the design of the campus, which is expected to get LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification as an environmentally friendly project. The new campus was one of the last major initiatives for Jobs, who died last year. In 2010, when HP abandoned its Cupertino campus, Jobs quietly arranged to buy the site, according to Walter Isaacson's biography, ""Steve Jobs."" ""I want to leave a signature campus that expresses the values of the company for generations,"" Jobs told Isaacson. A team of 50 architects was hired, and Jobs, as was his habit, was intimately involved in the details, according to the book. Much of the campus sits on the former site of an apricot orchard, and Jobs required that 80% of the campus be natural, with more than 6,000 trees. Apple hopes to raze 26 buildings on the site to make room for the ""spaceship,"" which will be surrounded by grass and trees. A June 7 City Council meeting was one of Jobs' last public appearances. At the meeting, he spent about 20 minutes introducing the project and answering questions. ""It's a little like a spaceship landed,"" he said as council members got their first look at the design. ""I think the overall feel of the place is going to be a zillion times better than it is now. ""I think we do have a shot of building the best office building in the world. I really do think architecture students will come here to see this. I think it could be that good.""","Apple is moving forward with ""spaceship"" campus in Cupertino .

"By . Helen Roberts . A street vendor in India got the shock of his life when he found a two-week-old baby inside a bag he stole hoping it contained cash. Kishor Kale, 20, was selling nail polish to women on a train journey, from Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus to Belapur, in Mumbai, India, when he noticed an abandoned bag sitting on the side of a carriage. Hoping it had money and other valuables inside, Mr Kale picked up the bag and exited the train. The two-week-old baby boy was abandoned in a bag on a train, before the bag was stolen by Kishnor Kale and then abandoned again . But when Mr Kale later unzipped the green bag on the station platform he found a baby’s hand reach out to him. Shocked, Mr Kale tried to flee and further abandon the little baby but a vigilant station ticket collector caught him. Soon, a crowd assembled and everyone was staring at the adorable 15-day-old baby sleeping inside the bag. The police arrived and detained Mr Kale thinking he was abandoning his own baby. They are now investigating the story. The healthy baby was found in a backpack (left) before being taken to this rescue home (right) Police officer Hanuman Kharat, of Wadala Railway Police Station, said: 'We’re investigating the case and we’re using Mr Kale to help us recreate the scene and find the baby’s real family.' Police are also using CCTV footage to find out who exactly abandoned the bag on the train. Mr Kharat said: 'We are also speaking to maternity hospitals in the area to find out who has given birth to boys this week.' Doctors at the Bhabha Hospital, in Mumbai, quickly declared the baby healthy and he was temporarily sent to Asha Sadan – a children’s home in Mumbai. Mrs Vijaya Moorthy, an official at the home, confirmed they were taking care of the boy. The police officer said Mr Kale has inadvertently saved the life of the baby boy. 'He could’ve died inside the bag if Mr Kale had not mistaken the bag’s weight for money,' Mr Kharat said. 'Things happen in mysterious ways.'","Backpack was abandoned on a train near Mumbai .

The move is aimed squarely at Apple, which was last weeks forced to admit its own version of the Maps apps was a failure.

'We are extremely sorry for the frustration this has caused our customers and we are doing everything we can to make Maps better.' Mr Cook took the unprecedented step of advising users that other products were available. 'While we’re improving Maps, you can try alternatives by downloading map apps from the App Store like Bing, MapQuest and Waze, or use Google or Nokia maps by going to their websites and creating an icon on your home screen to their web app.' The firm also changed the description of the Maps app on its site, removing references to it being the 'most beautiful, powerful mapping service ever'.

Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the toy shops, Frozen is back – to the delight of small girls everywhere and the concern of hard-pressed parents. Disney is releasing a short sequel, Frozen Fever, before Easter and retailers are already preparing for new merchandise. Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s The Snow Queen, Frozen become a global phenomenon when it opened in 2013. It won two Oscars (one a Best Original Song award for critically acclaimed hit Let It Go) and overtook Toy Story 3 to be the biggest animation ever. It raked in more than £820million in worldwide ticket sales, and became a huge money spinner – its merchandise boosted Disney profits by 35 per cent in the final quarter of last year, to £920 million. Now the seven-minute short is set to boost profits still further. Frozen Fever has been released alongside, and to help promote, new Disney blockbuster, Cinderella, starring Lily James and Cate Blanchett, and directed by Kenneth Branagh. The film premieres in America on March 13, and will show in British cinemas from March 27. Lego has teamed up with Disney to create Elsa’s Sparkling Ice Castle while Mattel has designed new Elsa and Anna dolls. Gary Grant, chairman of Dream Toys, which compiles the Toy Retailers’ Association list of must-have toys, said: ‘The popularity of Frozen toys has not waned since Christmas and the Elsa doll remains a top seller.’ Lego has brought out its first Frozen product, Elsa’s Sparkling Ice Castle, which comes complete with mini figurines of Queen Elsa, Princess Anna and snowman Olaf.

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Melting glaciers in the Alps may prompt Italy and Switzerland to redraw their borders near the Matterhorn, according to parliamentary draft legislation being readied in Rome. Glaciers in the Alps near the Matterhorn are receding, forcing the border to be redrawn. Franco Narducci of Italy's opposition Democratic Party is preparing a bill to redefine the frontier with neighboring Switzerland, his office said Wednesday. Narducci is a member of the foreign affairs panel in Italy's lower Chamber of Deputies. Foreign Minister Franco Frattini has authorized the bill. Switzerland also has cooperated with Italy on the matter. The Italian Military Geographic Institute says climate change is responsible for the Alpine glaciers melting. ""This draft law is born out the necessity to revise and verify the frontiers given the changes in climate and atmosphere,"" Narducci said. ""The 1941 convention between Italy and Switzerland established as criteria [for border revisions] the ridge [crest] of the glaciers. Following the withdrawal of the glaciers in the Alps, a new criterion has been proposed so that the new border coincides with the rock."" The border change only affects uninhabited mountaintop terrain. The deputy excludes the possibility of any family having to change citizenship. The border between Italy and Switzerland was fixed 1861, when Italy became a nation, but it has been occasionally modified, the Military Geographic Institute said. The border was last modified in the 1970s when the Switzerland-Italy highway was built at the Brogeda crossing. The bill is expected to become law by the end of April, Narducci said. Unlike Switzerland, Italy can change its border only with new laws approved by parliament. Narducci said the same negotiation will be proposed to France and Austria . ""Once upon a time, the border line demarcation between two nations was synonymous to war and bloodshed,"" he said. ""Instead , today we proceed with photograms.""","Melting glaciers in Alps forcing Italy and Switzerland to redraw their borders .

"(CNN) -- Sean Sasser, whose relationship with the late Pedro Zamora on MTV's ""The Real World: San Francisco"" broke cultural barriers on U.S. television, has died, his longtime partner told CNN on Thursday. Sasser was 44. Sasser, who had been HIV positive for 25 years, died Wednesday from mesothelioma, a rare form of lung cancer that was diagnosed just last month, Michael Kaplan said. He died in the Washington home he shared with Kaplan. Sasser was not one of the original cast members but became a household name as his relationship with Zamora was explored during the show's third season in 1994. The couple's exchange of vows during a commitment ceremony, the first ever broadcast on U.S. television, became a landmark moment in TV history. The couple began dating during the taping of the series. Their relationship and Zamora's battle with AIDS while living in ""The Real World"" house with seven strangers became must-see-TV for teens and young adults, many of whom had never been exposed to a gay couple, much less someone living with HIV. Zamora, who had been diagnosed with AIDS at age 17, was a well-known AIDS activist at the time he was cast on the show at age 21. Sasser, who was also working as an activist and educator, also revealed on the show that he was HIV positive. During the taping of the series, Zamora's health took a turn. ""This wasn't a romantic death. It wasn't a heroic death. It was horrible, and Sean couldn't do anything except watch it happen,"" fellow co-star Judd Winick told the online magazine POZ in 1997. Winick chronicled his friendship with Zamora and Sasser in the graphic novel ""Pedro and Me: Friendship, Loss and What I Learned."" Zamora died on Nov. 11, 1994, with Sasser at his side just hours after the airing of the final episode of the season, which featured the two men exchanging their vows, according to MTV. Sasser continued his work as an AIDS activist and educator. Sasser recently moved from Portland, Oregon, to Washington when Kaplan took a job with AIDS United, a non-profit group. The couple had dated off and on for years since the 1990s, but moved in together about six years ago, Kaplan said. Sasser was a pastry chef at RIS, a Washington restaurant, but he was unable to work for the last five weeks, Kaplan said. His last week was spent in bed at home, his partner said. His illness evolved quickly, with the July diagnosis of stage 4 mesothelioma following a June blood test showing an abnormality, Kaplan said. News of Sasser's death spread quickly across social media, with Winick posting a series of photos of Sasser and Zamora via Twitter. Actor and gay rights activist Wilson Cruz wrote on Twitter: ""My heart breaks. Another beacon of light in our community is darkened tonight with the passing of Sean Sasser."" ""It is because of Pedro and Sean that I made safe decisions about protection and partners in 1993 at just 15. Thanks,"" Yasemin Abdulraouf wrote in a post on Twitter. Another person, identified by the Twitter handle Hollis, wrote: ""U & Pedro showed true grace & dignity in the face of adversity. Hope u have found peace."" MTV wrote, simply: ""RIP to a member of the MTV family, groundbreaking Real World star + AIDS activist."" People we lost in 2013 .

Almost 100,000 British pensioners living in warm countries including Spain, France and Greece are to lose their winter fuel payments in a crackdown on ‘sunshine benefits’. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has hammered out details of a new ‘temperature test’ that will remove the handout, worth up to £300 a year, from such expats. In total, it will mean that payments are stopped to 92,983 residents of Spain, France, Greece, Portugal, Malta, Cyprus and Gibraltar, he revealed. Taxpayers will save almost £17million a year. Almost 100,000 British pensioners living in warm countries including Spain, France and Greece are to lose their winter fuel payments in a crackdown on  'sunshine benefits' Mr Duncan Smith said countries where the average annual temperature is higher than the warmest region of the UK – the South West at 5.6C (42F) – will be affected. Italy is not included because its northern region has a winter climate colder than that of the British Isles. Its exclusion means 1,859 Britons will still be able to claim the benefit, even if they live in the warmer south. There has been increasing controversy over pensioners’ free TV licences, bus passes and winter fuel payments, with half the Cabinet arguing that they should be reined in if further squeezes on working-age welfare are to be justified. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has hammered out details of a new ‘temperature test’ that will remove the handout, worth up to £300 a year, from such expats. But David Cameron pledged at the last election that the payments would be protected until 2015 – and there has been months of wrangling over whether to begin reining them in for expats. Almost £2million goes abroad every week to claimants who still qualify for welfare despite leaving the UK. Traditionally, people were only eligible for the winter fuel payment if they were living in Britain at the age of 60 and only moved out later. But thanks to a ruling by the European Court of Justice, the UK would have been forced to pay out to all 444,000 British pensioners living abroad – costing up to £100million a year. The court insisted that any  elderly expat should be able to get the payment, no matter when they left Britain. There has already been a 13-fold rise in the number of expats claiming in the last decade. The . biggest expat population is in Spain, where 49,443 pensioners are . receiving the payment, worth £200 for the over-60s and £300 for those . over the age of 80, costing taxpayers £8.85million a year. But in December and January temperatures in Spain can reach 17C (63F). There . are almost 28,625 recipients in France, many of them in the south where . temperatures in winter are often a comfortable 13C (57F). Controversially, the new regime will mean richer pensioners who have . emigrated to colder countries – or warm parts of Italy – will continue . to receive the payments, while poorer pensioners will lose it if they . are in warmer areas. In total, it will mean that payments are stopped to 92,983 residents of Spain, France, Greece, Portugal, Malta, Cyprus and Gibraltar, he revealed. Taxpayers will save almost £17million a year . Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘The huge increase in UK winter fuel payments made to people living in European countries equates to a near doubling in costs to the British taxpayer and follows a ridiculous ruling by the European Court of Justice. ‘The winter fuel payment is intended to help British pensioners with heating costs. From winter 2015/16, we are changing the rules so that it no longer goes to people in European countries with an average winter temperature higher than the warmest part of the UK.’ The number of winter fuel payments made to people in the European Economic Area and Switzerland for winter 2012/13 was 119,587, an increase of 44,901 on 2011/12.","Part of a crackdown on ‘sunshine benefits' in warm countries .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:55 EST, 30 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:03 EST, 30 August 2013 . A man has been arrested in Mexico after he allegedly sent emails to the FBI and media outlets threatening to decapitate Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. Aniruddha Sherbow, 43, was apprehended by California police Wednesday in Tijuana. He was then turned over to federal agents in San Diego. The alleged threats occurred August 1 and 3, according to the FBI and U.S. Capitol Police. Tragedy averted: Aniruddha Sherbow, 43 (left), was arrested in Mexico for allegedly sending an email to FBI threatening to sever the head of Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (right) ‘I, Aniruddha Sherbow, with the Divine as my witness, do hereby solemnly vow to find Tulsi Gabbard, wheresoever she may be, and to sever her head from her body,’ he wrote to the FBI, according to the Hawaii Reporter, which said it had also received a copy of the email from Sherbow. The FBI would not confirm the nature of Sherbow’s threat, saying only that it was based on a ‘credible’ threat. Sherbow will face charges of transmission of threats in interstate commerce, authorities said. Sherbow will make his first court appearance later today before being returned to Washington. Gabbard spokeswoman Heather Fluit said she had no comment other than that the first-term congresswoman ‘is grateful for the work of the U.S. Capitol Police, FBI, and all law enforcement officers involved in this investigation.’ Mr Sherbow reportedly has a history of harassment and threats targeting Gabbard, 32. In 2011, Gabbard, who was then a city councilwoman in Honolulu, sought and received a three-year injunction against Sherbow after a series of abusive telephone calls and text messages. Miss Gabbard told the Honolulu Star Advertiser in March 2011 that Sherbow had been ‘calling me numerous times, at strange hours’ and sending messages that were ‘extremely inappropriate, profane, vulgar and sexual in nature.’ ‘Basically, taking it as far as he could go,’ Gabbard told the newspaper. History of violence: In 2011, Gabbard, then a city councilwoman in Honolulu, obtained a three-year injunction against Sherbow after a series of disturbing and profane phone calls and texts . Gabbard said then that she contacted police after Sherbow’s messages became more abusive, including one that said if she approached him he would force her to perform a sexual act. Miss Gabbard is an Iraq War veteran and was elected to Congress in 2012. She is one of the first two female combat veterans, first Hindu and first woman of Samoan descent to serve as a U.S. representative. Mr Sherbow, a philosophy major and author who goes by the moniker 'Sphinx the writer', referred to Gabbard as 'The Prima Donna' who made his feel 'insignificant' in his correspondence with the Hawaii Reporter. Sherbow told the paper that he had approached Gabbard offering to volunteer in her council office as a PR person, but was rejected by her and eventually thrown in jail without being charged. The 43-year-old claimed that he was never served with the restraining order obtained by Gabbard, and said that he was falsely accused by the congresswoman of threatening her. The aspiring writer told the paper that initially he wanted to reach out to Gabbard because they both hail from the Hare Krishna Movement. ‘Because of this last connection, I think she is counting on me not hurting her. And she is right to count on it, because it is in fact very difficult for me to hurt her,’ he wrote. ‘However, we all have our limits, and I have reached mine.’ He continued: ‘At this point, if you stuck Tulsi’s head in front of me, I’d have it off in two seconds flat. … I hoped the whole thing might have some good ending somehow, but I’m not seeing one.’","Aniruddha Sherbow, 43, was arrested in Tijuana, Mexico, after sending email to FBI threatning to behead Rep.

"Louis van Gaal rained on Swansea’s parade, telling the Welsh side they did not deserve to beat Manchester United 2-1. The United boss was fuming after his side suffered only their second defeat in 20 games in all competitions, falling to goals from Ki Sung-Yueng and Bafetimbi Gomis after Ander Herrera had put the visitors ahead in the first half. He said: ‘We created a chance every two minutes in the second half and they had one chance. Louis van Gaal (centre) was fuming after Manchester United suffered only their second defeat in 20 games . ‘In the first minute of the second half Swansea had a good chance and after we were dominating the game. We were not effective. In one counter they a shot (from Jonjo Shelvey) deflected and maybe also Gomis is in an offside position. So we are not happy and not lucky.’ There was a whiff of sour grapes about Van Gaal’s review of a game in which Swansea actually had more shots on goal - six to United’s three. Van Gaal added: ‘We dominated the game even with 10 men because Robin van Persie could not run anymore because of an injury (after United had made their last substitution). United goalkeeper David de Gea dives in vain to try as Ki Sung-Yueng scores the equaliser for Swansea . Jonjo Shelvey's long range shot was deflected off Bafetimbi Gomis' head for Swansea's winner . ‘It is always frustrating when you lose after dominating a team. Your disappointment is much bigger because of that. ‘It's amazing we have lost. But you do lose games. We have only lost to Southampton (since November) and when that happens we have to continue. We were the better team. But against Burnley we were not, so it's the benefit of football that the result is unpredictable. But for us it's very disappointing.’ Swansea manager Garry Monk, who has now done the double over United this season, was bemused by Van Gaal’s reaction. He said: ‘I'd rather be lucky than good. Yes we had to ride some pressure, but all their pressure amounted to one shot. We got a fantastic goal and probably could have got a third. ‘It’s the first time in the club's history (double over United). I told players before game anything in terms of creating history is worth fighting for. To be able to do the double everyone connected to club should be proud of it.'

Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, hinted the Government may channel money saved from departmental budgets into infrastructure projects . Ministers are to pump billions of pounds into big infrastructure projects after being urged to boost growth by the International Monetary Fund. In a speech last night, Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, indicated that Chancellor George Osborne will funnel cash from day-to-day departmental budgets into major building projects. In a speech to the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, Mr Alexander vowed to ‘stick to the path we are on’ economically and rejected Labour’s calls for more borrowing to fund investment. But he said: ‘We will continue to show flexibility wherever it is needed, and to shift resources wherever we can to support economic growth.’ He added: 'For key areas of capital . expenditure - like infrastructure - we intend to make commitments right . through to the end of the decade.' Mr Alexander stressed that the Treasury was taking a ‘zero-based approach’ to capital projects in the spending review, requiring departments to show that every scheme they propose will generate economic benefits. He said: ‘When we took such an approach in 2010, it resulted in the most economically important areas being prioritised. 'So investment in transport, for example, was not just protected from cuts, its budget was actually increased in every year, which has enabled us to commit to crucial projects like High Speed 2.’ Danny Alexander said the Coalition has shown its willingness to invest in infrastructure projects by committing to HS2 railway . His comments suggest the government is listening to the IMF, which last week called for ministers to shift current spending into infrastructure projects to boost growth in the economy. But Labour Treasury spokesman Chris Leslie accused the government of dragging its feet. He said: ‘George Osborne has invested billions less in infrastructure than the plans he inherited, meaning housebuilding is at record lows and the construction sector is shrinking. ‘Ministers should listen to the IMF, which said that infrastructure investment must be brought forward right now. Decisive action this year would not only create jobs and growth now but strengthen our economy for the long-term. Major infrastructure projects have also been beset by dithering and delay.’","Danny Alexander hints Government will invest in infrastructure .

"Practices: The Office of fair Trading has told the biggest payday loan firms to improve how they inform customers and chase debts . Payday loan giant Wonga has increased the interest rate it uses to illustrate the cost of borrowing to 5,853 per cent – a rise of 1,600 per cent. The move has triggered more calls for tighter regulation of an industry that cashes in on hard-up borrowers. Most customers of payday loan firms only take out small amounts over a short period to tide them over until they get their salary. But lenders are required by law to give a representative annual percentage rate of interest (APR), setting out what the loan would cost over a year, so customers can make comparisons with other firms easily to find the cheapest deal. Wonga used to give the example of a £207 loan over 20 days, with interest and charges of £47.42 and an APR of 4,214 per cent. But it now uses a new example of someone borrowing a smaller sum of £150 for 18 days, with interest and charges of £33.49 and an APR of 5,853 per cent. Wonga has not actually increased its charges or interest rates, but says it has voluntarily changed the loan example it uses on its website as a better reflection of how customers borrow. The firm argues that the APR calculation, which makes assumptions about borrowing money over a full year, is not the best way to illustrate the cost of its loans to customers. A spokesman said: ‘We made the change as the way our customers are using the service has changed. More are taking out shorter loans for smaller amounts, which, perversely, has the effect of increasing the representative APR. Providing a clear and full cost up front is one of our responsible lending policies.’ How much? Wonga has pushed up its typical APR to 5,853 per cent but it says that customer's will pay less . Short term fix: Most customers of payday loan firms only take out small amounts over a short period to tide them over but lenders have to set out what the loan would cost over a year . On its website, it tells customers: . ‘While shorter Wonga loans cost less in real terms for our customers, . this trend means a bigger representative APR. It’s crazy but true.’ Wonga . and the 49 other biggest payday loan firms have been put on notice by . the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to improve the way they agree loans, . provide information to customers and chase debts. Interest: The projected APR for small Wonga loans is considerable . Some customers have been given loans without proper checks that they are earning and can afford repayments. Others have been allowed to roll over short-term loans several times, pushing interest charges to punishing levels. Several firms have used heavy-handed tactics to chase debts. Earlier this year, it emerged that a father killed himself after being harassed by payday loan firms demanding repayments. Anthony Breeze, 36, from Bolton, burned to death after dousing himself in petrol and setting himself alight. A Citizens Advice study found the firms are fuelling debt and misery by lending to the vulnerable, including people who are drunk, the under-18s and the mentally ill. Its chief executive, Gillian Guy, said: ‘High interest rates are just one of the problems people face when taking out payday loans – hefty charges, rollovers and having their bank accounts drained, leaving them in serious financial hardship and struggling to repay money they’ve borrowed.’","Payday loan firm gave new projection of what it costs to borrow based on smaller sums .

Lima, the capital of Peru, is the second largest capital in the world that’s located in a desert and access to drinking water is a problem to its 7 million people. Over a million have no access to running water at all and rely on private companies to deliver to their homes. The city is part of a coastal desert of Atacama, the driest in the world. It depends on drainage from the Andes as well as runoff from glacier melt — both sources on the decline because of climate change. Due to the extremely dry climate, annual precipitation is less than 1 inch, many people draw water from wells that are often polluted – worldwide 2.2 million people die every year from drinking contaminated water.

"An 18-year-old who beat his mother to death with a hammer then sexually abused her body smiled at jurors during the murder trial. Kevin Davis, from Corpus Christi, Texas, was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison for the murder of 50-year-old Kimberly Hill on Wednesday. During the trial, prosecutors played a taped confession of Davis confessing to the murder on March 26. Kevin Davis, an 18-year-old who beat his mother to death with a hammer then sexually abused her body smiled at jurors during his murder trial . Kevin Davis, from Corpus Christi, Texas, was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison for the murder of 50-year-old Kimberly Hill (pictured) on Wednesday . Davis admitted to investigators he had choked his mother with a cord and stabbed her in the head before finally killing her with a hammer, according to KiiiTV. The teenager had reportedly asked his mother for permission to die, because he had grown 'weary with life and hated other people.' When she told him she was upset, but that he could decide to do what he wished, he snapped and murdered her, the Corpus Cristi Caller Times reported. Grisly: Jurors heard Davis describe everything he did to his mother during an interview, where he signed his confession . No remorse: Davis told police who interviewed him that he did not regret what he had done, though he says he did love her . Police found Hill's body undressed from the waist down and posed. Davis told investigators during his interview that he had sexually abused his mother after she was murdered. In the interview, Davis told investigators, 'I wouldn’t take back what I did. I did love her in a way' Davis almost waited for his sister to kill her too, but decided against it, instead leaving a trail of blood in the home leading from the living room to the master bedroom, along with written messages such as 'Chase me. Sorry for the mess. KD.' 'I had my fill of killing. It seemed a little much,' he told investigators. From his home, he took his bicycle and backpack and tried to leave town. He eventually abandoned both in a bush by the train tracks and walked to a home in nearby Robstown, where he confessed to a couple. In the interview, Davis told investigators, 'I wouldn’t take back what I did. I did love her in a way.' 'I’m a terrible, disgusting person,' he added. He also told investigators he had homicidal fantasies about his sister and mother. Calling it 'a night to remember,' he described another fantasy where he would decapitate a girl before having sex with her body in a dress. The defense called no witnesses during the trial, and when Davis's lawyer appealed for a lighter sentence in light of mental issues Davis had, the prosecution's reply was to say that it had seen no medical evidence of any mental or emotional illness. Davis told investigators he thought he deserved 100 years and claimed, 'I'm not mentally disturbed. I’m sane. I know what I did.' 'I don’t have standards. I don’t have morals. A body’s a body. A piece of meat,' said Davis.","Kevin Davis, 18, killed his mother, Kimberly Hill, 50 in March in Texas .

"Gareth Colfer-Williams was one of more than 1,200 infected by measles in the Swansea area . A young father who was not inoculated against measles as a child died from the disease during an epidemic in Swansea. More than 1,200 people were infected by the virus in the South Wales outbreak. The epidemic last November hospitalised more than 80 young people who had not had the vaccine at the height of the MMR scare. An inquest at Swansea Coroners Court heard how Mr Williams died after he had complained of suffering from a rash on this body, fever and hallucinations, to doctors. He had been advised by . doctors to rest at home, take paracetamol and stop taking . detoxification medicine he had started, in case he was reacting to it. Mr Colfer-Williams was concerned about his four-year-old daughter Dakota and made sure she had the jab. He was said to be vulnerable to infection as he had begun a detox two weeks before his death after suffering from alcohol problems. Consultant pathologist Dr Maurizio Brotto said at 5ft 8in, Mr Colfer-Williams was 'very underweight' weighing just 7st 7lbs. Mr Colfer-Williams' death in April came seven months after the outbreak of the disease last year. A major vaccination programme was launched during the outbreak as parents were warned children could suffer anything from an eye disorder to deafness, brain damage, or death. Mr Colfer-Williams was not inoculated against the disease as a child. He and his partner Cairo Oneim (pictured right) ensured their 4-year-old daughter Dakota was protected against infection .

Cairo and Dakota are having a terrible time.' Dr Brotto told the inquest Gareth was positive for measles and died from giant cell pneumonia caused by the disease. He said: 'Measles is a viral infection which doesn’t kill you but it can lead to giant cell pneumonia.'

"Ian Poulter was embroiled in a bitter social media row with the president of the PGA of America on Friday after being branded ‘a little girl’ for his criticisms of Sir Nick Faldo and Tom Watson. PGA chief Ted Bishop aimed a puerile assault at the Englishman after Poulter, in his recent book No Limits, lashed out at Faldo’s captaincy of the defeated European team at the 2008 Ryder Cup. Writing on his Twitter account, Bishop wrote: ‘Faldo’s record stands by itself. Six majors and all-time RC points. Yours vs. His? Lil Girl.’ Ted Bishop aimed an assault at Ian Poulter, who had criticised Nick Faldo's captaincy at the 2008 Ryder Cup . Poulter said the comments made by Bishop were 'disappointing for the leader of the PGA of America' In a separate post on his Facebook page, Bishop cited Poulter’s criticisms of Watson’s decisions as US captain in this year’s Ryder Cup, writing: ‘Used to be athletes who had lesser records or accomplishments in a sport never criticised the icons. ‘Tom Watson (8 majors and a 10-3-1 Ryder Cup record) and Nick Faldo (6 majors and all-time Ryder Cup points leader) get bashed by Ian James Poulter. Really? Sounds like a little school girl squealing during recess. C’MON MAN!’ Bishop later deleted the messages, with Poulter hitting back in a statement: ‘Is being called a “lil girl” meant to be derogatory or a put down? Poulter said Sir Nick Faldo has lost a lot of respect from players because of his comments about Sergio Garcia . The Englishman also hit out at Tom Watson for dropping Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley at the Ryder Cup . ‘That’s pretty shocking and disappointing, especially coming from the leader of the PGA of America. No further comment.’ The PGA of America said Bishop, whose two-year term in the post ends next month, ‘realised that his post was inappropriate and promptly removed it’. The 60-year-old later said: ‘Obviously I could have selected some different ways to express my thoughts on Poulter’s remarks. ‘Golf had always been a sport where respect was shown to its icons. That seems to have gone by the wayside.’ Faldo is the only losing European Ryder cup captain this century, and during commentary for this year’s tournament he riled Paul McGinley’s team when he said Sergio Garcia was ‘useless’ during the loss in 2008. Poulter and Garcia (right) celebrate with the trophy after Europe's Ryder Cup victory earlier this year . ‘Faldo has lost a lot of respect from players because of what he said,’ Poulter wrote. ‘2008 is the only Ryder Cup we’ve lost in the last 15 years. And he was captain. So who’s useless? I think Faldo might need to have a little look in the mirror.’ Poulter was also critical of eight-time Major winner Watson’s call to drop Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley for both sessions on Saturday at this year’s Ryder Cup, which Europe won 16½-11½. Poulter said Watson’s decision-making ‘completely baffles me’ and called it ‘utterly bizarre’. Bishop, a controversial figure in American golf, made 65-year-old Watson the oldest captain in Ryder Cup history. He recently announced that a task force had been appointed to help solve America’s recent losing streak in the Ryder Cup.","Ted Bishop called Ian Poulter ‘a little girl’ for his criticisms of Sir Nick Faldo and Tom Watson .

"Dutch police have uncovered a city centre cannabis farm after spotting a remarkable lack of snow on the roof of one home, while neighbouring buildings suffered a heavy covering. Officers in the city of Haarlem, 12 miles west of Amsterdam, raided the otherwise unremarkable home after spotting it had a snow-free roof despite heavy snowfall only hours earlier. The lack of snow suggested the temperature inside the building was so high that the snow was melting more rapidly than on neighbours' homes - a tip-off from Mother Nature that Dutch police are turning to with increasing frequency in order to catch cannabis cultivators in the winter months. Scroll down for video . Evidence: Officers in the city of Haarlem, 12 miles west of Amsterdam, raided the otherwise unremarkable home after spotting it had a snow-free roof despite heavy snowfall only hours earlier . Cultivation of marijuana requires the temperature inside a building to be far higher than in normal properties, with growers using expensive lighting rigs to ensure the plants are tricked into believing they are growing in a country with a warmer climate. While in summer months the effects are not unnoticeable to anybody standing outside the building, the effects of keeping the plant at a steady 29C can lead to unwanted consequences. With snow almost guaranteed in the Netherlands' mid-winter, police are increasingly looking out for houses with a tell-tale frost free roof to locate the otherwise unremarkable residential houses drug lords favour when creating cannabis farms. In fact the technique has become so common that Dutch police last week released details of several cannabis farms they discovered using the technique - including a photograph of the building in Haarlem. Last Monday officers used the same premise to raid a farm in the city of Zutphen, where they found a total of 88 cannabis plants. Two days later one person was arrested in Arnhem in similar circumstances. Not everybody is happy with the technique, however. After Haarlem police revealed the unorthodox method, Twitter users asked whether innocent families with a sauna in a loft conversion could also expect to be raided as potential drug lords, as their homes suffer similar snow-free roofs. After  police in Haarlem (pictured) revealed their unorthodox method of identifying cannabis farms, Twitter users asked whether innocent families with a sauna in a loft conversion could also expect to be raided . The arrests may come as something as a surprise to those who thought growth of cannabis was legal in the Netherlands, which has long had a relatively relaxed attitude towards the drug. However the law states that no more than five cannabis plants can be grown in any one, as that is believed to be the cultivation limit for personal use. Any more than five plants and the grower is considered to be a preparing the drugs for sale, which is illegal. Possession of cannabis is restricted to no more than five grams in a public place. The Dutch police technique of visually checking rooftops for snow is something of a low-maintenance adaption of the way British police use helicopters equipped with heat-seeking technology to identify buildings giving off abnormally high levels of heat. Speaking in 2013, Martin Knowles, West Midlands Police Deputy Air Operations Manager, said: 'Our thermal cameras can detect unusually high temperatures coming from properties several thousand feet away – anyone growing cannabis on a commercial scale, using rows of heat lamps, runs the very real risk their criminality will be rumbled from the skies.'","House in Haarlem, Netherlands had snow free roof despite heavy snowfall .

"By . Nick Craven . Romantic notion: Secretary of State for Health Jeremy Hunt with Chinese wife Lucia pictured earlier this year . Health secretary Jeremy Hunt has been accused of ‘hypocrisy’ for saying British people don’t care enough for the elderly – when Coalition cuts mean nearly 33,000 older people have lost access to day care centres. The Mail on Sunday can reveal the dramatic cuts amount to a 37 per cent loss since 2010 in the number of places at the centres, described as a ‘lifeline against isolation’ for many. Charities said it was hypocritical for Mr Hunt to launch a fight against loneliness among the elderly while slashing budgets and forcing the  closure of the day centres. ‘Policy rhetoric about preventative services without funding is surely hypocritical,’ said Richard Furze, chief executive of the charity Friends Of The Elderly. ‘The Government should not be too quick to tell others what more they should do when they are cutting funding for services such as community transport and day centres that  are a lifeline to so many older people.’ The day care centre figures from the NHS Information Service show that in 2010 there were 88,498 elderly people using centres in England, which fell to 68,160 by 2012 and 55,655 by 2013. In some regions such as the West Midlands, the numbers plummeted by 52 per cent while the drop was 46 per cent in London. Meanwhile Mr Hunt, who used China as an example of a society where the elderly are better treated, was accused of a ‘romantic’ and outdated view. Caroline Abrahams, director of Age UK, said: ‘We were not wholly convinced by Mr Hunt’s rather romantic suggestion that we have lessons to learn from China. Life is changing quite fast there. Several generations ago, families there would stay together, especially in rural areas, but they are industrialising so quickly and younger people are moving to the  cities in search of work, very often leaving the older people behind.’ Mr Hunt, who has a Chinese wife, Lucia, had spoken ten days ago of  ‘a forgotten million who live amongst us – ignored to our national shame’. Placing the onus on families, he had claimed: ‘Each and every lonely person has someone who could visit them and offer companionship.’ He added: ‘I am struck by the reverence and respect for older people in Asian culture. ‘In China and Japan, it is quite normal for elderly parents to live with their children and their families.’ Campaigners also derided a recent government suggestion that one way for the elderly to combat isolation was to connect to the internet on tablet computers and hold video conferences with friends and relatives. The suggestion was made in response to a critical House of Lords committee report on ministerial plans to cope with the care crisis. Alone with their troubles: Charities say that too many old people are being left in their homes without any company . But Jane Silk, director of the newspaper Mature Times, said: ‘It’s the ultimate insult. ‘So the elderly are to sit in the only heated room in the house with a television and a tablet for company – is that their only solution?’ A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Day centres can provide a valuable service but the wider problem of loneliness needs to be tackled by a change in attitude by society. There is no substitute for each and every lonely person having someone to visit them. ‘We have allocated an extra  £200 million for local authorities for 2014-15, and created a £3.8 billion budget for health and social care in 2015-16. This investment will help to drive forward better health and wellbeing for thousands of older people.’","Cuts amounting to 37 per cent since 2010 have slashed the number of places at day centres for the elderly .

"In his choice of vice- captains, Paul McGinley has avoided the charge levelled at Tom Watson that the American management team has a hint of ‘Dad’s Army’ about it. If there is any concern about the European captain’s five wise men it is due to the sheer number of them. There will certainly be any number of opinions for him to draw on, with a broad range of experience, including two men who have won matches themselves in his role. McGinley has explained that he liked the way having five vice- captains worked at Celtic Manor and the extra demands that come with being in charge of the home side require additional support . Team Europe vice captains Miguel Angel Jiminez (left), Sam Torrance (centre) and Jose Maria Olazabal (right) Tom Watson and Team USA's vice captains are Andy North, Raymond Floyd and Steve Stricker . They will be used in a variety of ways: as his eyes and ears out on the course, a source of wise counsel, as morale-boosters and motivators, and taking charge of certain groups of players — in the build-up and during the three days of the event itself. McGinley believes these are people in whom he can place absolute trust. Miguel Angel Jimenez . Beneath his carefree and cigar-chomping exterior the Spaniard is reckoned to have an astute analytical golfing brain. He already has leadership experience, having captained Europe in the much lower profile EurAsia Cup. Completely tuned in with the players, he is likely to be casting his eye over Thomas Bjorn and Victor Dubuisson, among others. Des Smyth . The 61-year-old Irishman has the lowest profile of the quintet. He still plays on the Veterans’ Tour and, like many of his compatriots, was a renowned expert at mastering wet and windy conditions. When McGinley came on to the circuit as a player Smyth served almost as a father figure and mentor to him. He will be a reassuring sounding board for the captain. Irishman Des Smyth has arguably the lowest profile of Team Europe's five vice captains . Paul McGinley and one of his vice captains, Pedraig Harrington ahead of the 2014 Ryder Cup . Sam Torrance . Few men are more synonymous with the Ryder Cup than the gravel-voiced Scot, who made eight appearances as a player and was then a winning captain in 2002. Closely linked with McGinley, partly through his late father Bob who coached the Irishman, there is no aspect of the competition he has not experienced one way or the other. This competition’s ultimate wise old bird. Padraig Harrington . McGinley goes back so far with the major winner that they were actually at school together and served a joint apprenticeship playing alongside each other in amateur competitions. Like Jimenez, the one-time aspiring accountant has an analytical mind and is plugged into the tour. He has a kinship with McDowell and McIlroy. Jose Maria Olazabal . The man who presided over the Miracle of Medinah is sufficiently ego-free to slot in comfortably as a deputy. Emotional and an excellent speaker in the team room, he will be one to inject some real feeling in there if needed. Medinah gives him natural authority, although McGinley will hope that he did not use up all his Ryder Cup luck last time out.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 27-year-old man has been accused of fatally stabbing his elderly father and seriously wounding his mother in a savage scissor attack in their New York apartment this morning. New York Post reported Anthony Powe was taken into custody in his underwear shortly after the 5.45am attack at the apartment at 784 Columbus Avenue, Manhattan. The mentally ill son allegedly ran from the Upper West Side building near West 97th Street, through Central Park to East 96th Street on the other side of the city, where he was nabbed by police. Scroll down for video . Scene: Anthony Powe, 27, is accused of knifing his parents inside their apartment on Columbus Avenue, Manhattan (pictured) about 6am this morning . Darlington Powe, 71, was found dead inside the eighth-floor apartment while his wife, Alicia Powe, 56, was rushed to St. Luke’s . Hospital in a serious condition. The father, reportedly an accountant at Bellevue Hospital Center, had allegedly been repeatedly stabbed in the face and chest, and the mother had been stabbed in the chest. Neighbors heard screams and called the police, who reportedly found a pair of bloody scissors in the apartment. An upstairs neighbor told the Post she heard a woman yelling and begging the attacker to stop. 'Oh my god! I heard it! I heard a woman screaming in the apartment below. I heard her say, ‘Stop, you’re going to kill him! Oh my God, no!’ They are such beautiful people,' she said. Scene: Police were called to the Manhattan apartment this morning following reports of an assault . Powe's distraught sister said her brother loved his family and blamed his history of mental issues for the alleged attack, but said he had never been violent. 'I can't believe this is happening. He is schizophrenic. Once he realizes what he did, he's going to freak out,' Rochelle Powe, 44, told DNAinfo. 'He goes to hospitals on a regular basis . and went to peer groups. He heard voices in his head. He had to stay on . his medications.' She said her father was a 'wonderful, fun-loving dad' who was good at math and created oil paintings. Darlington Powe's ex-wife, Martha Powe, 70, said the alleged attacker 'always had problems'. 'He always had nervous problems. Darlington was worried about him,' she said. 'He was really worried. It was a major concern. He thought he needed treatment.' Violent: An upstairs neighbor reportedly heard a woman screaming and begging the attacker to stop this morning . Troubled: Rochelle Powe said her brother adored his family and was particularly close with his father, who he lived with in this Upper West Side apartment building . Pablo Maria, a 63-year-old maintenance worker in the building, told the Post the son had a history of troubling behavior. 'His son is crazy. Always walking around with capri pants, you know, short pants, making weird faces. He crazy!' Maria, who had worked in the building for 18 years, said. 'The . problem [is] because too many people live in that apartment. Seven . people in a studio! Two sons, two daughters, mother, father and . grandmother in wheelchair. And crazy son!' He said the son worked the night shift at a local food store. A former neighbor who lived one door down for six years told DNAinfo she frequently heard fights in the apartment. She moved out of the complex about a week ago. 'They fought a lot. I shared a wall with them and they were always fighting, always screaming and fighting,' Fruma Reiss, 36, said. Hospitalized: Alicia Powe was rushed to St. Luke's Hospital (pictured) in a serious condition after being stabbed in the chest with a pair of scissors . A police spokesman told DNAinfo the suspect allegedly attacked his parents over a domestic dispute. The Post reported police had responded to calls about domestic incidents eight times since December 2004, with the last call received on December 29 last year. Charges against the son are pending. The Columbus Avenue building where the attack occured is part of Park West Village, according to their tenants association website.","Anthony Powe allegedly attacked his parents in their Manhattan apartment about 5.45am this morning .

"By . Damian Spellman, Press Association . Seamus Coleman is confident Aiden McGeady can be a regular match-winner for the Republic of Ireland after watching him do just that in Georgia. The 28-year-old Everton winger chose Ireland's tricky Euro 2016 Group D opener in Tbilisi as the perfect moment to display his undoubted talent on a sustained basis and fire his country to a precious victory. McGeady's double, the second of which arrived inside the final minute of normal time at the Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena, clinched a 2-1 win and fulfilled team-mate Coleman's pre-match prediction. Match winner: Aiden McGeady scored Ireland's winning goal in the 90th minute against Georgia . What a strike! McGeady's late strike ensured Ireland won their opening Euro 2016 qualifier . The full-back said: 'He [McGeady] was brilliant, fantastic. I said to him before the game, ""You can win us this match"" because he's got that ability to beat players and his confidence is up at the minute, and I'm delighted to see it. 'To be fair, I thought a lot of people would have snatched at it - James [McCarthy] actually played him in rather than shoot, which was great composure in his behalf. It was a good Everton goal. 'We were delighted - he won us the game. Moments of magic win games and Aiden definitely did that tonight. 'We all know that's what he is capable of week-in, week-out and as long as he believes it, he can be a top, top player.' McGeady's brace took his tally for Ireland to five goals either side of Tornike Okriashvili's 38th-minute equaliser, although the fact that it arrived in his 70th senior appearance is a stick that has often been used to beat him in the past. However, he is thriving on Merseyside after forcing his way into the team following his January arrival from Spartak Moscow, and Coleman and his team-mates at both domestic and international level will hope there is more to come. Confidence boost: Seamus Coleman believes McGeady has benefited from a move to Everton . The former Sligo Rovers defender said: 'It's difficult because he was playing in Russia and maybe not a lot of people follow the Russian league. He might have been doing brilliantly out there and you just don't notice it. 'But since he has come to us, the manager believes in him a lot. He has started the season very well and he showed tonight that he's on top form. 'It's brilliant for him. His confidence is up - the move to Everton could have done him the world of good. We saw the best of Aiden McGeady on Sunday night.' Left back Stephen Ward, who lined up behind McGeady for much of the game, was equally thrilled by his contribution, but far from surprised. Ward said: 'We see him every day and we know how good a player he is. He has done fantastically well for our country and tonight showed just how big a player he is because he was outstanding. He scored two and came bitterly close to getting a third as well. 'To score that late is important and gives us a good start, but throughout the game, I thought we fully deserved it. High praise: Ireland manager Martin O'Neill lavished praise on Everton star McGeady . 'When they got their goal, it was a bit of a setback, but I didn't think we panicked at all. We kept playing our football, we kept the ball really well and thankfully Aiden came up with a piece of absolute brilliance and won us the game. 'Something like that, we see every day in training and when you have got a player like that in your team, you have got every chance all the time.' The Republic will now welcome minnows Gibraltar to the Aviva Stadium next month knowing victory there would send them into their toughest game of the campaign in Germany with maximum points and brimming with confidence. 'We won't look too far ahead of the next game - the manager and the staff here won't let us,'added Ward. But if we can continue and get another positive result, we will go to Germany full of confidence. 'That's the minimum to go there with now, and hopefully we can do that.'","Everton winger Aiden McGeady scored in the 90th minute against Georgia .

"New York (CNN) -- The Indian diplomat whose arrest sparked a testy exchange between the United States and India won a dismissal of a federal indictment Monday, according to court documents. Devyani Khobragade was arrested and strip searched by federal agents in New York City in December after federal authorities accused Khobragade of lying on a visa application about how much she paid her housekeeper. She was indicted on January 9 by a federal grand jury on one count of visa fraud and one count of making false statements. Khobragade then filed a motion to dismiss the charges, claiming she was ""cloaked in diplomatic immunity at the time of her arrest,"" according to the motion. The court agreed, stating that Khobragade was ""appointed a Counselor to the Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations, a position that cloaked her with full diplomatic immunity,"" according to court documents. She was appointed to that position on January 8, a day before she was indicted. ""Even if Khobragade had no immunity at the time of her arrest and has none now, her acquisition of immunity during the pendency of proceedings mandates dismissal,"" U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin wrote. ""The government may not proceed on an indictment obtained when Khobragade was immune from the jurisdiction of the court,"" Scheindlin continued. Khobragade's attorney, Daniel Arshack, said in a statement that Khobragade is pleased that ""the rule of law has prevailed."" ""We are heartened that the court agreed with our legal analysis and rejected the prosecution's arguments by dismissing the case,"" he said. India's external affairs spokesman, Syed Akbaruddin, issued a statement welcoming the ruling. James Margolin, spokesman for the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, did not rule out the possibility of further charges. ""As the court indicated in its decision, and as Devyani Khobragade has conceded, there is currently no bar to a new indictment against her for her alleged criminal conduct, and we intend to proceed accordingly,"" he said in a statement. Khobragade, who left the United States in January, is now working for the Indian Ministry of External Affairs in Delhi. Her case drew international attention, with Indian officials demanding apologies from Washington, and the United States announcing it would withdraw one official from its embassy in New Delhi. CNN's Allison Malloy in New York and Harmeet Singh in New Delhi contributed to this report.","NEW: India welcomes the ruling .

The two firms, far and away the UK's market-leading sportswear brands, say it is no longer economically viable for them to supply smaller shops. Nike, which sponsors the England football team and may of the country's top players including Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, claims the move aimed to cut costs and improve consumer experience. Foul play: Sportswear giants Nike, which sponsors England star Wayne Rooney, left, and Adidas who sponsor David Beckham, right, will no longer supply to retailers who sell less than £25,000 worth of the products . Nike, which is the UK's biggest sports equipment brand, is the current kit supplier to the England football team . Meanwhile Adidas, which sponsored the . British Athletics team at the London Olympics amid pledges to support . sport in the community, said the decision to ditch outlets that were .

Sports in Kentish Town is among the businesses affected, has fiercely . condemned the decision. Criticism: Former Olympics minister Tessa Jowell has slammed the move . She told the Evening Standard: 'It is behaviour which is inconsistent with the promotion of local sports participation. 'A shop like that is never going to reach that sort of turnover. 'But if you take brands out, it is much, much less appealing. 'They . should of course reconsider and make it clear they will have a policy . in relation to the very small shops  - maybe not turnover of their . product but turnover more generally.' Nick Mavrides, the owner of Ace Sports, . told the newspaper: 'They just want to get into bed with the big chains . - JD Sports, Footlocker, and they don't care about anyone else.

"A New Zealand retail outlet has been forced to defend criticism about an incredibly thin mannequin displayed in one of its stores. The thinly-shaped female model photographed by a New Zealand University student, Emily Robins, has sparked intense discussion about female body issues and how women should be represented. Ms Robbins, 25, tweeted the image she photographed inside Fashion retailer Glassons accompanied by the caption: 'Purging is in this season!' and has been the subject of intense criticism by health experts despite the company's boss deeming the model 'healthy.' The mannequin displayed in the Glassons shop which was posted to Emily Robin's twitter page . Ms Robins, a former actress on New Zealand show Shortland St, tweeted the mannequin has the potential to make women feel inadequate and that was a form of 'control.' But the company's boss, Graeme Popplewell, told Stuff.co.nz  that science determines what a healthy weight is and defended the woman wearing the two piece bikini as 'healthy.' He said the mannequin's proportions meant it would have a 'healthy' body-mass index (BMI) of 18.8, just above what would be classed as underweight at 18.4. Many, including NZ radio presenter Jen Bainbridge were a little taken a back by the female mannequin . He also said that because of the way the mannequin is positioned - its arm raised and slightly inverted - people are led to believe that it is thinner than it really is. He said a female in a similar position would have an enhanced rib cage. He also said the position of the lights in the store, relative to the body,  accentuates the woman's rib cage. 'The key is that due to the position of the mannequin with the arm elevated and slightly twisted, the rib cage is naturally enhanced as it would be in real life,' Popplewell said. But Ms Robins said the debate should not be based around a classification of what is deemed healthy, but  making women feel more adequate about their body image. 'It's not the mannequin would have a healthy BMI, it's we need a wider range of representations for women's bodies,' she tweeted. A New Zealand Women's Health Action director Julie Radford-Poupard said the mannequin undoubtedly 'full on.' A budget British clothing store Primark removed a line of models it used which attracted widespread criticism. The thin looking females also had protruding ribs and removing it from their stores. A range of thin looking female mannequins used by a budget British clothing store were removed after being criticised . The retail stores should bare the responsibility for the image they put out to customers, she said, and respect different shapes and sizes in women. women through accurate mannequins of a range of shapes and sizes. A 2011 University of Otago and Ministry of Health survey showed the average BMI for a Kiwi woman was 27.6 - classified as 'overweight'. University of Waikato  lecturer in health education Debi Futter-Puati said the 'incredibly thin' mannequin was 'disturbing'. 'When I look at that image with all her ribs showing, the message it's sending is that that's desirable and that's the way you're supposed to look as a young woman.' 'What's the message they're hoping to give by using a mannequin like that - that if you wear our clothes you'll look this so-called 'good'?' She said developing girls between 10 and 12 would be exposed to the image and perpetuate the myth that you had to be thin to be healthy. 'Let's ask Glassons to have a diverse range of women's shapes and sizes that portray much more everyday New Zealand women. Let's be real.'","The mannequin was spotted by Emily Robbins, a university student, inside an Auckland retain store in New Zealand .

"By . Belinda Robinson . Two fishermen were stunned after they caught two albino lobsters in the space of a week - despite  the rare crustacean being one in 100 million. Bert Philbrick caught a white lobster off Owls Head, less than a week after Joe Bates caught one about a mile off the Rockland breakwater in Maine. The unusual lobsters are extremely rare and look translucent compared with the more usual green and brown lobsters which most people are more familiar with. Rare: Two rare albino lobsters flank a rare yellow lobster on a deck in Owls Head, Maine . The haul came as a surprise for lobsterman Bates, who has 300 traps off Rockland and has been catching lobsters since 1990. It seems that he . has been on a roll of late and also caught a yellow lobster on Monday, . estimated to be one in 30 million, but that wasn’t the first time that . that had happened. However, when he saw the white lobster in his trap he said that he was ‘surprised and shocked.’ But despite his rare find, there was some debate about the exact breed of the lobsters. The white shells naturally led to the conclusion that the lobsters were ultra-rare albinos. Bob Bayer, executive director of the University of Maine’s Lobster Institute said he’s only seen a couple of albino lobsters in his lifetime. Translucent: In this photo provided by Owls Head Lobster Company, two albino lobsters sit in a crate with other lobsters . He told The Portland Press Herald: ‘We get blues (and) we get red ones every summer. That’s not a big deal. This is if they’re actually albino.’ On closer inspection, Bayer said, it seemed at least one, if not both, have a blueish hue. ‘I don’t think they’re albinos. It looks like there’s some pigmentation there. Still, whatever they are is highly unusual, it’s nothing I’ve seen before.’ A true test of their colour would be to feed the white lobsters food high in carotenoids, like crab and periwinkles because this type of food will darken the shell, if they’re not albino. And if they are cooked, true albinos would stay white, say experts. Both white lobsters were under legal size and about 5 or 6 years old according to Terry Watkinson, owner of the Owls Head Lobster Co., where the fishermen brought their rare catches. Blue lobster: This photo provided by Meghan . LaPlante shows a blue lobster caught by her father Jay LaPlante off Pine . Point in Scarborough, Maine . Normally, that would mean they’d have to be thrown back into the ocean to mature for two years– but seeing as they are so rare that’s probably not going to happen. One of the white lobsters has already been snapped up by Brooks Trap Mill, a Thomaston lobster supply store. The other will go to the Maine State Aquarium in Boothbay Harbor, adding to the spectrum of coloured lobsters already on display there. Last month, two blue lobsters were caught in Scarborough and were taken to the Maine State aquarium. Blue lobsters are estimated by the Lobster Institute to be one in 2 million. Earlier this year, a lobsterman pulled a one-in-30 million calico lobster in New Hampshire. It was sent to a Hampton aquarium. In late July, a yellow lobster ended up in a supermarket tank in Florida, where a customer bought it and sent it to an aquarium in Rye, New Hampshire. But none compare to the ultra-rare albinos. If any more are found, experts suggest that there could be some unusual breeding in the area.

"(CNN) -- Gareth Bale's stunning hat-trick against Inter Milan in the Champions League in 2010 announced the Welshman as a player the world should keep an eye on. That virtuoso performance ultimately came in a losing cause as the Italian side dumped Bale's Tottenham out of the European Champions League and went on to win the continent's premier club competition. Times have changed for Inter, who are struggling in Serie A and staring down the barrel of a Europa League exit after Bale inspired his English side to a 3-0 victory in the first leg of their last-16 tie. Bale nodded Tottenham in front at White Hart Lane and his opener was added to by Gylfi Sigurdsson and Jan Vertonghen as Andre Villas-Boas' side put themselves in a commanding position. They are now odds on to knock Inter out when they travel to Italy for the second leg next week, though Bale will miss the game after picking up a yellow card for diving, a theme that has dogged him in recent months. The 23-year-old has now been booked for diving six times since the start of 2012, his third yellow in the Europa League leading to a one-match ban. Bale told ITV: ""We played well and set tempo from the first whistle, we made it difficult for them. I'm enjoying playing and it gives us a good lead going into the away leg."" While Tottenham continue to flourish in Europe, their Premier League counterparts -- European champions Chelsea -- are not enjoying life in the Europa League. They won the Champions League for the first time in their history last season, but became the first defending club to go out in the group stages this year. And after limping through against lowly Sparta Prague of the Czech Republic in the last round, they sank to 1-0 defeat in Romania to Steaua Bucharest in the first leg of their tie. With the majority of Chelsea's fans vehemently opposed to the installation of Rafa Benitez as their interim manager, and voicing their displeasure at every game, another lackluster display will not do much for the Spaniard's popularity. Raul Rusescu's penalty decided the game -- he scored from the spot after being fouled by Ryan Bertrand. Fernando Torres tested Ciprian Tatarusanu with a volley just before halftime and Eden Hazard went close as the game entered its dying stages as his volley grazed the crossbar. ""It was a difficult game, you could see the atmosphere and the pitch was not the best,"" Benitez told ESPN. ""It was a soft penalty to give in this situation with so many officials. We cannot change that now. The referee gave the penalty but no red card? Strange."" English Premier League side Newcastle drew 0-0 away at Anzhi Makhachkala in Russia. The match was played at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium due to security concerns in Anzhi's home territory of Dagestan. Newcastle's returning French winger Hatem Ben Arfa had the best chance of the match but saw his effort saved while Anzhi's Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o looked dangerous for the home side. Italian outfit Lazio took a firm grip of their clash with VfB Stuttgart thanks to a 2-0 victory in Germany. Lazio, riding high in Serie A, have a formidable lead to protect back in Rome next week after goals from Ederson and Ogenyi Onazi. A late goal from Pierre Webo put Turkish club Fenerbahce in control of their tie against Viktoria Plzen of the Czech Republic. Levante and Russian club Rubin Kazan drew 0-0 in an ill tempered game in Spain. Cristian Ansaldi got his marching orders first for the visitors before Michel was dismissed two minutes later. FC Basel beat Russian side Zenit St Petersburg 2-0 in the first leg in Switzerland. Goals from Marcelo Diaz and Alexander Frei sealed the win while Zenit had Carlos Luis Neto sent off late on. An own goal from Cedric Carrasso handed Benfica a 1-0 win over French side Bordeaux in Portugal.","Gareth Bale scores as Tottenham thrash Inter Milan 3-0 in the Europa League .

"(CNN) -- A cheating scandal at Harvard College just got bigger, and this time the focus is flipped: Administrators, not students, are under fire. On Monday, the school apologized for the way it handled a secret search of the e-mail accounts of resident deans. It conducted the search in an effort to find who leaked information about the scandal to the media last year. ""While the specific document made public may be deemed by some as not particularly consequential, the disclosure of the document and nearly word-for-word disclosure of a confidential board conversation led to concerns that other information -- especially student information we have a duty to protect as private -- was at risk,"" said a statement from Deans Michael D. Smith and Evelynn M. Hammonds. ""Consequently, with the approval of the dean of FAS (Faculty of Arts and Sciences) and the University General Counsel, and the support of the dean of Harvard College, a very narrow, careful, and precise subject-line search was conducted by the University's IT department,"" they added. Smith and Hammonds stressed that the search was limited to administrative accounts, and that it did not involve a review of e-mail content. Harvard students forced to withdraw amid cheating scandal . ""To be clear: No one's e-mails were opened and the contents of no one's e-mails were searched by human or machine,"" they said. The search successfully identified a resident dean, who had forwarded a confidential e-mail. However, after review, school officials determined the dean in question had committed ""an inadvertent error and not an intentional breach"" by sending the message to two students. Other resident deans were not told of the search, which was first reported by The Boston Globe. ""Operating without any clear precedent for the conflicting privacy concerns and knowing that no human had looked at any e-mails during or after the investigation, we made a decision that protected the privacy of the resident dean who had made an inadvertent error and allowed the student cases being handled by this resident dean to move forward expeditiously,"" Smith and Hammonds said. ""We understand that others may see the situation differently, and we apologize if any resident deans feel our communication at the conclusion of the investigation was insufficient,"" they added. News of the secret search drew immediate criticism from some members of Harvard's faculty. Harry Lewis, a professor and former dean of Harvard College, said on his blog that he will likely move most of his personal e-mails to another account, keeping his Harvard address just for business. He described the way the school handled the case as dishonorable. ""Why not tell people you are reading their e-mail? Would it not be the honorable thing to do? What is to be gained by not doing that? Other than avoiding, perhaps, the embarrassment of acknowledging that you are doing something to which the targets would reasonably object if they knew it,"" he wrote. Attempts to contact Harvard for details on Monday on the search and the handling of it were unsuccessful. Last month, the school announced that more than half the students implicated in the cheating scandal had been required to withdraw for a time. More than a hundred students were investigated for plagiarism or for having ""inappropriately collaborated"" on a course's take-home, open-book spring final exam. The class was Government 1310: Introduction to Congress, according to The Harvard Crimson, the school's student newspaper. Many of those who were not forced to withdraw faced disciplinary probation at the Ivy League institution in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the remaining were cleared. CNN's Rande Iaboni contributed to this report.","Harvard searches the administrative accounts of resident deans .

"(CNN) -- The city of New Haven, Connecticut, will promote 14 firefighters who were involved in a workplace discrimination case that worked its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The firefighters were among the New Haven 20 -- one Hispanic and 19 white firefighters -- who fought the city after it threw out the results of a 2003 firefighter promotion exam that left too few minorities qualified for promotions. A U.S. District Court issued a judgment finding the city violated the civil rights of a group of the white firefighters when it threw out the exams in 2004, according to Jessica Mayorga, city spokeswoman. The Tuesday decision follows a court action by seven black New Haven firefighters seeking to delay the promotions. ""Yesterday, the court entered an order that provides the City of New Haven with the legal sanction necessary to move forward and promote the fourteen plaintiffs in the Ricci case entitled to promotions,"" the city said in a statement. ""As a result, we intend to do so as soon as practicable."" The firefighters will be promoted to either lieutenant or captain. Mayorga said the other six involved in the lawsuit were not eligible for promotions that were available at the time the exams were given. She said the court's order only addresses 14 of the 20 plaintiffs. If the exams had been certified in 2004, the other six plaintiffs would not have been promoted. The case was the center of attention during the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of now-Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who was on the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals that backed the city in the case. The U.S. Supreme Court eventually overturned the appeals court ruling 5-4 earlier this year when the justices ruled that the city improperly threw out the results of the promotion exams. Key plaintiff Frank Ricci and others took promotion exams in 2003 for lieutenant and captain positions that had become available in Connecticut's second-largest city. New Haven's personnel department had contracted with a private firm to design the exams. When the results came back, however, city lawyers expressed concern about the results because none of the black firefighters and only one Latino who took the exam scored high enough to be promoted. The city said that under a federal civil rights law known as Title VII, employers must ban actions such as promotion tests that would have a ""disparate impact"" on a protected class, such as a specified race or gender. The group of firefighters, claiming they were wronged by the city's action, then sued, calling themselves the ""New Haven 20.""","Firefighters fought city after it threw out the results of a promotion exam .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Thousands gathered in the Egyptian capital on Friday in a mass demonstration against the country's armed forces and its heavy-handed treatment of protesters, which has since drawn international condemnation. Protesters could be seen erecting tents in Cairo's Tahrir Square, a location widely considered the epicenter of an uprising that brought down Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak earlier this year. The move marks the latest in a series of protests around the capital, where at least 16 people were killed in recent days amid clashes with Egyptian authorities. The unrest appears to largely stem from a stretch of assaults by police and defiant protests by demonstrators demanding that Egypt's ruling military cede power to a civilian government. Protesters on Friday could be heard singing the country's national anthem and chanting slogans, such as ""The honor of Egyptian women is a red line."" They also put up a large projector screen in the city's square, which showed videos of violence against protesters and included testimonials by the injured and family members of those recently killed. Days of clashes were further stoked last weekend by the beating of a woman at the hands of military officers, prompting Tuesday's so-called ""Million Women"" march, billed as an attempt to highlight regime violence against female demonstrators. Egypt's ruling military council later expressed ""great regret"" to the women over recent attacks and vowed to hold accountable those responsible. Security forces, meanwhile, on Friday appeared largely absent from the demonstration, according to CNN personnel at the scene. But political groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party, as well as the Salfi Islamic Movement, said they were boycotting the events. The country's Islamic Wasat Party, however, has decided to participate. Elsewhere in Cairo, hundreds of protesters converged on the city's Abasya Square, chanting slogans such as ""No to Destruction."" Large crowds also gathered in similar demonstrations in the Egyptian cities of Alexandria and Suez, according to state television. On Wednesday, Egypt's military announced on Facebook that they had acquired information of a ""plan to vandalize government buildings and topple Egypt on January 25, 2012."" The date would mark the one-year anniversary of the start of Egypt's uprising that largely began in Tahrir square on January 25, 2011. Demonstrators have also called for the country's presidential elections, scheduled to take place in June, to be moved ahead to instead take place on the anniversary. A Ministry of Health spokesman, meanwhile, said that some 30 ambulances have been stationed near Tahrir Square and a field hospital has been set-up in anticipation of possible clashes.","Thousands gathered in Cairo in a mass demonstration against the country's armed forces .

They occupy the remainder of . their day resting, often on their backs with their flippers crossed . over their large bellies, in a pose closely resembling W50. Dangerous . encounters with boat propellers injure many of these curious . herbivores, giving them deep, curved scars similar in appearance to the . arcs made by the powerful jets on the large W50 remnant. 'Optically bright astronomical objects, . those visible to the eye and optical telescopes, often are nicknamed for . their earthly likenesses, such as the Whirlpool Galaxy and Owl Nebula,' said the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in a statement. When the VLA's giant W50 image reached . the NRAO Director's office, Heidi Winter, the Director's Executive . Assistant, saw the likeness to a manatee, the endangered marine mammals . known as 'sea cows' that congregate in warm waters in the southeastern . United States. The enormous W50 cloud formed when a giant star, 18,000 light years away in the constellation of Aquila, exploded as a supernova around twenty thousand years ago, sending its outer gases flying outward in an expanding bubble. The remaining, gravitationally-crushed relic of that giant star, usually a black hole, feeds on gas from a very close, companion star. The cannibalized gas collects in a disk around the black hole. The disk and black hole's network of powerful magnetic field lines acts like an enormous railroad system to snag charged particles out of the disk and channel them outward in powerful jets traveling at nearly the speed of light. The Manatee Nebula, W50, (green dot) is found 18,000 light years away in the direction of the constellation Aquila, the Eagle . This system of a black hole and its feeder star shines brightly in both radio waves and X-rays and is known collectively as the SS433 microquasar. Over time, the microquasar's jets have forced their way through the expanding gases of the W50 bubble, eventually punching bulges outward on either side. The jets also wobble, like an unstable spinning top, and blaze vivid corkscrew patterns across the inflating bulges. Until now, the nebula was known as W50, a less catchy name by being the 50th radio source listed in the Westerhout Catalog, assembled in 1958 by Dutch astronomer, Gart Westerhout.","W50 is one of the largest supernova remnants ever viewed .

"Asuogyaman, Ghana (CNN) -- Patricia Mawuli grew up in a mud shack in Ghana's bush country. As a young girl, she would wistfully watch the planes pass overhead, wishing one day to fly one herself. In 2007, at the age of 21, she decided to break into the boy's club that is Ghana's flight industry. She walked to Kpong Airfield and asked for job. ""I (told) her no, we don't employ women,"" recalls Jonathan Porter, the airfield's technical director. ""The whole concept of employing women in an environment where you're clearing trees and building airplanes didn't seem to me, in my experience, to fit in with the African context,"" he admits. Mawuli was persistent, however, and when she offered her services for free, he couldn't resist giving her a trial. He gave her a machete and told her to clear tree trunks. To his surprise, she flourished. ""She used her head, not just her muscles,"" he recalls. ""She thought about how she did things and took out the trees better than the men."" Not only did Porter give her the job, he taught her how to fly, and in 2009 she became the country's first female civilian pilot (as well as the first woman in West Africa certified to build and maintain Rotax engines). ""I said: 'I will do whatever it takes, I'll work hard, you don't have to pay me.' They told me: 'Don't worry. You are so different. You've got energy, you have potential. We will do whatever it takes.' This is when my whole flying career just started to boom,"" recalls Mawuli. Since then, Mawuli has been offered jobs from all over the world, but she's decided to stay put and help grow a generation of female pilots in Ghana. With Porter, she has launched an academy called AV-Tech, which aims to provide young Ghanaian girls with the skills, training and inspiration they need to make it on their own as pilots. ""There are a lot of young people (who), when they see me, (are given) hope. It motivates them to learn harder because they believe women actually have something ahead of them,"" she says. Some, like Catherine Shelton, have come from as far afield as the United States to learn from Mawuli. ""She's a very good instructor,"" says Shelton. ""She's taught me general airfield operations -- safety, security -- (and) a lot culturally. She's taught me the difference in the aviation industry here versus the U.S. versus Europe. ""And she keeps me smiling.""","Patricia Mawuli is Ghana's first female civilian pilot .

"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN)  -- A Brazilian TV host denies authorities' charges that he orchestrated the murders of drug dealers and other criminals to generate sensational footage for his show. TV host Wallace Souza is accused of ordering hits on criminal rivals and then covering the deaths for ratings. Wallace Souza, a state legislator and former host of a police TV show called ""Canal Livre,"" also was a drug trafficker, officials say. And to get rid of the competition -- and drive up ratings -- he would order that criminal rivals be killed and then would have his camera crews arrive first on the scene, authorities say. ""In truth, they went as far as creating acts,"" said Thomas Augusto Vasconcelos, intelligence secretary for Amazonas state. ""It's been determined that the crimes were committed in order to generate news for the program."" Souza has denied the accusations, and his lawyer has criticized key testimony and questioned the investigation. ""In all the investigations carried out by the public minister and the police, up to now they have not presented any technical evidence of any type,"" attorney Francisco Balieiro said on Brazilian TV. State officials say Souza faces charges of forming a criminal gang, corrupting testimony, drug trafficking and illegal possession of firearms. He remains free because of legislative immunity, officials say.  Watch report on Souza's former show, charges he faces » . State Attorney General Otavio Gomes told the Agencia Folha news outlet that Souza's gang has been linked to six slayings. But prosecutor Pedro Bezerra told the news outlet he could not bring murder charges against Souza for lack of concrete evidence. The Amazonas State Justice Tribunal, which held a hearing on the accusations, said the criminal complaint was based on testimony by former Souza associate Moacir Jorge da Costa. After Jorge's arrest, he talked about the gang's reputed activities, including slayings. Souza's lawyer, Balieiro, said police and public ministry officials did not have standing to investigate the TV show host because he is a legislator. Furthermore, Balieiro said, Jorge's testimony was obtained in an irregular manner. According to the state public minister, who brought the charges against Souza, the legislator's son, Raphael, belonged to the criminal gang. Raphael Souza has been convicted of homicide, drug trafficking and illegal gun possession. Fifteen people connected with Souza, among them police officers and a chief, have been arrested. Souza, a former police officer who left the force more than 20 years ago after being implicated in a fuel theft case, received the most votes of any candidate in the last election in Amazonas state. His TV show went off the air last year after the investigation into his possible criminal involvement intensified. He lives in the jungle city of Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state, a region of Brazil known for its prevalent lawlessness. Souza would often rail on his lunchtime show about the killings and other atrocities being committed in the area.

"ITV has defended its decision not to include any female presenters in its line-up of on-screen talent at this summer’s World Cup. The broadcaster yesterday unveiled its team of presenters and pundits who will travel to Brazil to present coverage of one of the world’s biggest sporting event, which is expected to attract millions of viewers per game. Former Daybreak host Adrian Chiles will head a 16-strong team which includes regular ITV pundits Roy Keane and Lee Dixon as well as a host of other former players such as Ian Wright, Glenn Hoddle and Gordon Strachan. It's a man's World Cup: Adrian Chiles will head a 16-strong team which includes regular ITV pundits Roy Keane and Lee Dixon as well as other former players such as Ian Wright, Glenn Hoddle and Gordon Strachan . They will be joined by reporter Gabriel Clarke, presenter Matt Smith and commentators Clive Tyldesley and Sam Matterface, who will all help present coverage of the 34 live games being broadcast by ITV during the month-long tournament. Last week the BBC unveiled its own line-up of presenters and pundits for the World Cup, which includes two women; long-time sports presenter Gabby Logan and Juliette Ferrington. Sky also include several high-profile female presenters on its football coverage, most notably on its rolling news channel, Sky Sports News. However, a spokesman for ITV defended the move on Tuesday, saying it had assembled the best team for the job. They . said: ‘We have an established and experienced on screen presenter and . reporter team who have led our broadcasts throughout England's . qualifying campaign as they will in Brazil. First-class males: ITV defended the move, saying it had assembled the best team for the job . ‘In . line with sport coverage across all media, our pundits tend to be drawn . from key figures currently or formerly involved with the game at the . highest level and we believe we have a first class World Cup line up . from a range of backgrounds. 'Whenever opportunities arise to bring in new people for ITV Sport, our aim is always to get the best we can.’ During the last World Cup held in South Africa in 2010, ITV employed reporter Kelly Cates to help present its coverage. However, the broadcaster will only take one reporter to this year’s event. On message: The BBC line-up for World Cup 2014 includes Alan Shearer, Rio Ferdinand, Gary Lineker, Thierry Henry, Gabby Logan, and Alan Hansen . Speaking at the launch of ITV’s World Cup team of presenters, Chiles said of the lack of female reporters: ‘It is a fair point, but the BBC are taking four reporters. We are not taking any because it comes down to cost. ‘If we did have four reporters I am sure we would have a women on the team. But we are not we are taking one who is Gabriel [Clarke] who will be with England. It comes down to numbers. ‘Who are you going to take off our panel? I think it is difficult. If we had a bigger team there would definitely be female involvement. Some of our biggest operators behind the scenes are women. The head count tells a different story. It is not sexist business as far as I am concerned. 'Most of the Albion fans I watch the game with week in week out are women. ‘I don't know if you'd call it a boys' club, we have got a lot of our key players behind the scenes are women actually.’","Former Daybreak host Chiles will .

Pearly whites: Newborn baby Imogen Elliot is all smiles after being born with a pair of front teeth .

The teeth are . sometimes loose because the root is not completely developed, and have . to be removed, but little Imogen’s teeth were given the all-clear. Mother Stacey Lewis said: 'As soon as Imogen was born, the midwives put her on my chest and I spotted them straight away. 'They're pretty noticeable- and I certainly wasn't expecting my baby to be born with teeth! I don't think the midwives knew what to say - they had never seen anything like it before.' Mother Stacey Lewis, 24, from South Wales was left baffled as when she noticed the pair of natal teeth .

Presumably still alive inside the shark's stomach, he is able to plunge the knife into the its head in a desperate fight for survival. Scroll down for video . Desperate fight for survival? A picture appears to show a man swallowed whole by a shark frantically trying to release himself by forcing his arm through the creature's gills and stabbing it in the head . In fact the photo has proved to be quite stomach-churning for all who see it for the first time when they walk into the Metung Hotel, in the Gippsland region of Victoria. But all is not as it seems. The unnamed fisherman did catch the shark and he did end up in its stomach. But first he made sure the shark was very dead before he gutted it and then crawled inside its body to prepare for a prank photo that would be taken by one of his friends. The dramatic part came when he then pushed his tattooed arm out through the shark's gills and pretended to be fighting for his life by stabbing the killer fish in the head. Locals, said radio host John Burns of Melbourne's 3AW, who was sent a copy of the photo, refer to the fisherman as the Shark Slayer. 'This fellow has decided as a jape to climb inside the shark with a knife, put his hand through the gills of the shark and pretended to stab it between the eyes,' Mr Burns told his listeners today. Open wide... Of course sharks - even ones as big as the Great white shark pictured here, are better known for biting large chunks off humans they come across rather than swallowing them whole . He then went on to describe the reaction of one pair of visitors. 'An American couple have turned up at the Metung Hotel to see this photo (on the wall) and their immediate response from the wife was ""Did he survive?"",' said Mr Burns. The fisherman happened to be standing behind the couple at the time. Although his response is not known, the Americans might have had the shock of their lives if he'd said: 'Yes, I did!'",The photo hangs in a hotel in the Gippsland region of Victoria .,0d991f4aa40811777b8eb2bde34cdbd885b8c255

"By . Maggie Harbour . Days of our Lives star Bryan Dattilo, who plays Lucas Horton, is a dad again! Dattilo and his wife of three years, Liz Cameron, welcomed their first child together on June 11. Little Delila Cameron Dattilo arrived just before 3 am., with Bryan having to report to work on the set of Days just 4 hours later! 'Luckily my baby daughter was born at a hospital very close to work so all I had to do was show up with a smile on my face, and the make - up people took care of the circles under my eyes,' he tells MailOnline in an exclusive interview. Oh baby! DOOL star Bryan Dattilo and his wife Liz Cameron are the proud parents of Delila, who weighed in at 6lbs 13oz . Heartthrob: Bryan has been playing character Lucas Horton for 20 years on TV's longest running soap . Dattilo, 42, says it’s been an adjustment being a dad again 14 years after his son Gabriel was born. 'First I think it’s going to be different parenting a little girl compared to being the father of a boy,' Dattilo tells MailOnline. 'I want Gabe to grow up to be a strong man, so sometimes I think I am a bit hard on him.  But I’m afraid I’m going to be putty in the hands of a little girl. 'When I first looked into Delila’s little face, I saw a lot of myself. She has my mouth and eyes, and there is something very familiar about her.' Dattilo, whose son from his first marriage lives with him and his wife, says some of the best times he shares with Gabe are watching and participating in sports, and he can’t help but wonder if Delila will chose shopping trips with mom or curling up on the couch with the boys to watch. 'I coach Gabe’s basketball, football and baseball teams,' says Bryan.'And it’s been a great bonding time for us. I’d love to coach Delila too, and am hoping she will be interested in tennis, soccer or softball. But I will be just as happy sitting in the front row watching her first dance recital. Whatever makes her happy will make me happy too!' Big brother: Bryan's son Gabriel, 14, is beaming with pride over the new addition to the family . Bryan and Liz also chose to bank the baby’s cord blood with a company called Cryo-cell. 'We did a lot of research into banking cord blood,' says Dattilo. 'And one of the prime uses for stem cells is to help treat Lymphoma or Leukemia. And Delila has grandfathers on both sides who have those illnesses. 'So who knows, maybe someday the blood we banked will benefit one of them.' Banking cord blood taken from a newborn’s umbilical cord is becoming very popular practice because the stem cells found in the cord are younger and more flexible than those found in adults. The stem cells also know how to ‘find,’ injured cells and repair them. Currently the stem cells are being used in transplants and for the treatment of more than 80 diseases including certain cancers, anemia, and Leukemia. The cells are also a perfect match for baby should she need it sometime in the future. An affair to remember: What DOOL fan can forget Sami Brady, played by Alison Sweeney, and Lucas Roberts' wedding in 2007 . And when it comes to the kids wanting to follow in their famous father’s footsteps Dattilo admits he’s not sure. 'Of course I want both of them to do whatever makes them happy,' he says. 'But I will explain that being an actor isn’t as easy as it looks. There are a nights where I have to memorize 20 pages of dialogue only to turn around and do the same thing the following day. 'And the audition process, with its high rate of rejection, is really hard on a person. It’s one of the only careers where you can work hard and do your very best and still not book the job.'

"A company based in Paris has released a ‘smart’ e-cigarette that they say can predict a user's life expectancy. The Smokio device connects to a smartphone app and tracks your usage, giving the user updates on both their health and finances over time. The company says the device will not only save smokers money, but it’ll also help them give up on real cigarettes. Scroll down for video . The Smokio e-cigarette, shown, claims to be able to increase a person's life expectancy by monitoring their 'vaping' usage while using the device. It links to a smartphone app and gives a user information on how their health would differ if they had continued smoking regular cigarettes . Inside the Smokio e-cigarette is a small microchip that transmits data to an app available for both Android and iOS. E-cigarettes could save millions of lives and should not be classed as a tobacco product, which would restrict their access, leading health experts have warned. Last week more than 50 researchers and specialists published a letter after claiming to have seen a leaked document from the World Health Organisation (WHO) which labelled the e-cigarettes as a 'threat'. The letter urges health officials to consider the health consequences of such a move, amid fears e-cigarettes will become harder to obtain. But critics say that not enough is known about the long-term effects of the devices, which deliver nicotine in a vapour. The e-cigarette is linked to a smartphone by Bluetooth in order to transfer information. Users can then view statistics over the last 30 days to see what their vaping - the term given to breathing nicotine-infused e-cigarette liquid - habits are. The device costs €80 (£65; $80) and includes a 900 mAh battery, which can hold about seven hours of charge. The electronic 'brain' of the device lets a user track usage and check their vaping history. When they smoke it monitors their usage and trends, telling them when and where they've vaped using GPS technology. It also shows users the equivalent consumption that would be smoked with cigarettes. The app then reveals to a smoker how their health would differ if they had continued smoking. This includes things such as blood oxygenation levels, taste and smell, lung capacity and heart rejuvenation. Through this information the app then estimates how many days the user has added to their life expectancy. ‘This is based on data taken from the American Cancer Society,’ Johan Collet of Smokio explains to MailOnline. ‘This takes into account your age and how much you smoke. It’s a catalyst taking into account all of the things that will improve your health.’ This then gives an estimate for how many extra days a smoker is adding to their life expectancy by switching tobacco for vaping. ‘The Bluetooth microchip in the battery collects data from when you take a puff,’ continues Collet. ‘This includes the time of the puff, intensity of the puff and all things like that. ‘It then stores and transmits it to your smartphone where calculations are performed and spit out in more readable form.’ The . effects of e-cigarettes are still largely unknown, with various . agencies such as the US Food and Drug administration currently . performing studies.

"By . Damien Gayle . Lobbyists are buying up ad space on ESPN to get their message across to sports-mad President Barack Obama and his White House team. Political strategists have revealed how they have begun suggesting the all-sports network to clients who want Obama and his officials to hear their concerns. The President and his staff, as well as other influential Washington figures, are reputed to be regular viewers of the broadcaster, which currently has a near monopoly on sports coverage. President Barack Obama does a behind the back move with a basketball: Lobbyists have begun taking out ads on sports network ESPN that are targeted at the sports-mad president and his team . That's despite one ESPN host branding the commander-in-chief's dismal display of his own basketball skills last month 'the most embarrassing moment of his entire presidency.' Companies and organisations have been cagey about the tactic, but those suspected of using it include Microsoft, the American Petroleum Institute and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Bruce Haynes of bipartisan public affairs firm Purple Strategies told Politico that he and colleagues had begun advising clients to advertise on ESPN. 'The data is clear that a significant amount of elites and influencers are watching ESPN and sports programs and that there is really a high value to being on those networks,' he said. 'You are much more likely to get the eyeballs you want than being on some other places.' Microsoft is one of the companies that have taken out adverts on ESPN that seem more directed at decision makers rather than consumers. The personal computer software giant took out slots on Monday Night Football programming to directly criticise rival Google as part of its Scroogled campaign. That campaign, which is still running on ESPN in Washington, raised questions about Google's business practices just as federal watchdogs considered taking action against the online ads and search firm over competition issues. Obama and wife Michelle watch a game: Media strategists say there is clear data to show that influential political figures are increasingly watching sports . But advertisers with an issue to push are not just using ESPN to target influential political figures. Strategists say the broadcaster is one of the few that people still watch in real-time, and adverts can also reach important non-ideological voters whose points of view are more susceptible to persuasion. Jim Spellane, spokesman for International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, said advertising on ESPN is part of a broader effort to reintroduce the union to the general public. But, he added, 'it doesn't hurt that an influential audience and electeds watch ESPN [too].'","Data shows that influential political figures are increasingly watching sports .

"(EW.com) -- After 10 years, Discovery Channel is ending ""American Chopper."" The Teutuls are going to build their final bikes on the network next month. One of Discovery's most popular programs, ""American Chopper"" helped pioneer the ""docusoap"" reality genre and inspired a surge of gear-head shows. ""Chopper's"" run will conclude with the previously announced four-way bike build-off special, titled ""The Revenge,"" airing live from Las Vegas on December 11. 'American Chopper' plans live four-way bike building competition . ""After 10 years and 233 episodes of incredible, riveting reality television, 'American Chopper' will be ending its run,"" says Eileen O'Neill, group president, Discovery and TLC Networks. ""This series was one of the very first family-based reality programs on television. Special thanks to Pilgrim Studios for over a decade of great producing. The Teutuls have given us really innovative bike builds and real drama since 2002. We wish both Orange County Choppers and Paul Junior Designs the best."" The series had a simple format â€” a father and son building custom motorcycles amid frequent infighting. Yet nothing about the show's colorful history has been straightforward. ""American Chopper"" has changed networks, switched names and was previously canceled, only to rise again. ""I have mixed emotions,"" executive producer Craig Piligian tells EW.com. ""It's had a great run. We had a lot of ups and downs. There's been so much that's happened to this family over the last 10 years. We've seen them grow to a huge motorcycle shop. We've seen them fight bitterly. We've seen them sue each other. And recently we've seen them come together to open up a new business. I think the show has come full circle."" ""American Chopper"" premiered as a Discovery Channel special in 2002, then launched as a regular series a few months later. In 2008, Discovery moved the show to its sister channel TLC. A couple years passed, then behind-the-scenes warring between Senior and Junior prompted TLC to outright cancel the show. Donald Trump gives 'American Chopper' duo advice . Parties soon made up, and in 2010 the company re-ordered the program as ""American Chopper: Junior vs. Senior."" The series later reverted to its original title and switched back to Discovery. ""This was the first family docusoap,"" Piligian says. ""They put on display, for all to see, what really happens in a tight family business, warts and all. I'm really proud they were so open and honest."" Paul Senior and Junior's spirited attitudes helped make the show engaging for fans, but could also make things difficult behind the scenes. At one point when shooting the current final season, Piligian fired Junior and kicked him off the set. ""It's a very tumultuous relationship, not only between the father and son, but between us as well,"" Piligian says. ""Junior and I would have it out, and at one point awhile back, I said, 'We're done with you.'"" The two reconciled and Junior returned to work shortly thereafter. Given the show's on-again, off-again history, one has to wonder: Is this really the end? Could ""American Chopper"" rise again in a year or two? ""American Chopper was canceled before and we came back even stronger,"" Piligian says. ""It's been a resilient, powerful show. Right now they're telling me it's canceled.

The scene could hardly have been more romantic as Vicky Pryce linked arms with her husband Chris Huhne while the sun set over the Aegean. Yet as they posed as one big happy family for a wedding photograph in Greece, only Huhne could have known they were living one big fat lie. To his trusting family, he was playing the dutiful stepfather as he gave away Georgia – his wife’s elder daughter from her first marriage. Line-up: Vicky Pryce links arms with her husband Chris Huhne as a family photo is taken after the ceremony in Varkiza - the 'Athens Riviera' Unsuspecting? Vicky Pryce and Chris Huhne at the wedding in Greece in September 2009 . Little did any of them suspect that, back in Britain, he was cheating on his family with his bisexual mistress Carina Trimingham. His double life was to blow the family apart and set his scorned wife on a path of revenge that culminated in them both facing jail. But on that balmy evening in September 2009, shameless Huhne soaked up the acclaim as he basked in the role of a proud father of the bride at the ceremony in Varkiza – a posh suburb of the Greek capital known as the ‘Athens Riviera’. He led 33-year-old Georgia down the aisle at the pretty cliff-top chapel where she married Ed Beesley. Then Huhne lined up for photographs flanked by the bride and his wife Vicky, who looked happy and suntanned in a black and white African print dress and a pearl necklace. Ambitious Huhne once openly boasted that his nuclear family would make him ‘such a photogenic prime minister’.

"Washington (CNN) -- The State Department called on the government of Iran Wednesday to investigate the death of a human rights activist this week, reportedly after security forces got into a confrontation with mourners at her father's funeral. Haleh Sahabi, an opposition activist and women's rights advocate, was arrested during Iran's 2009 post-election crackdown and was given a two-year jail sentence. She was allowed out of prison to attend the funeral of her father, noted Iranian dissident Ezatollah Sahabi. According to opposition websites, Sahabi was pushed to the ground during a scuffle between mourners and security forces and died of cardiac arrest. She was in her mid-50s. The opposition web site Kaleme said that security forces tried to interfere with the carrying of the body, confronting Sahabi and other mourners. She was clutching a photo of her father to her chest and fell when the security forces tried to take it from her, Kaleme reported. Another opposition site, Sahamnews, said one of the security forces punched her in the abdomen. ""Both Haleh and her father suffered in life for their political activism including imprisonment,"" deputy State Department spokesman Mark Toner said. ""We call on the Iranian government to investigate the circumstances of her death. If reports are accurate that government security forces contributed to her death, this would demonstrate a deplorable disregard for human dignity and respect on the part of the Iranian authorities."" Toner questioned the presence of security forces at the funeral and said the initial reports that Sahabi's death was related to the scuffle between the mourners and the security forces need explaining. ""Why Iranian security forces would have been at this event is question number one, and question number two is whether there was some kind of physical altercation that caused her to suffer,"" he said. Semi-official news agencies like Mehr and Fars said that Sahabi had not died at the hands of security forces, but rather due to a pre-existing heart condition. Sahabi's death comes just two weeks before the June 12 anniversary of the 2009 Iranian election, in which the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad angered supporters of Iran's opposition movement and sparked massive protests that were followed by a crackdown by the Iranian government. The Obama administration has increased pressure on the Iranian regime over alleged human rights violations, imposing sanctions recently on individuals believed to be responsible for violence against the opposition.","Women's rights advocate Ezatollah Sahabi dies at her father's funeral .

"(CNN) -- This week there was one particular story from the UK that really seemed to resonate with Americans on the Web. Mind you, it had nothing to do with topless photos of Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, for it seems we've finally moved on. Though, I'm not sure why. Seriously, when did we all of a sudden become decent human beings, unmoved by the promise of grainy photos of Catherine's bare chest? When did we decide that we would boldly shun and forget these images and thus no longer encourage the paparazzi to invade the privacy of foreign royalty? Answer: Tuesday. When we learned there might be a bacon shortage. Yes, that's when everyone here on this side of the pond collectively freaked out over the possibility that we might have to one day hit up the buffet and actually eat fresh fruit -- with all that ""nutrition"" and ""flavor."" That was the real tipping point. It's like Abraham Lincoln once said, ""You can take away our dirty Internet smut, but hands off the pork, dude."" Without question, bacon is the most interesting meat in the world, and if it were capable of original thought, we wouldn't even be having an election this November in America. We would simply appoint bacon as our forever leader and live dutifully under its rule. ""Today, for no apparent reason, I instructed U.S. troops to invade Calgary."" ""Hooray! Thanks, bacon!"" So, clearly, this was a big deal -- the kind of news that required every ounce of hyperbole I could muster. And maybe even pants. Maybe. The whole scare actually exploded on social media a couple of days after the National Pig Association of the United Kingdom (Motto: Some swine with your tea?) put out a press release ominously stating, ""A world shortage of pork and bacon next year is now unavoidable."" They might as well have just printed, ""Jump off a bridge. Take a friend."" The report sort of suggested that European drought conditions were the cause of the upcoming pork shortage -- that unfavorable weather had ruined the corn and soybean crop. Thus, less feed means fewer European pigs. That, or they're all just taking a gap year to go backpacking in Australia. ""Oy, mate, let's grab a pint and be hyper-critical of the American pigs staying in our hostel."" Naturally, it didn't take too long before all hell broke loose on Twitter. The great comedian Loni Love led the way: . ""Everyone complaining about replacement refs..we got bigger problems folks!! A BACON SHORTAGE!! **faints like a vanilla sister**"" Love also once told me in an interview how she hoped Gov. Chris Christie would join the Republican primaries because ""fat presidents would get everything done before lunch."" Bacon. She gets it. But now I'm here to tell everyone in America to calm down. I was totally with you -- the fatty, delicious pork sky was most definitely falling -- but it now seems we're all going to be just fine. At least as far as bacon goes. We still have Florida. Yes, the big scare is over; it was a misrepresentation of facts at best. And Slate business and economics correspondent Matthew Yglesias does a great job explaining what this all really means in an article he posted Wednesday. The headline of his story, and the basic takeaway: There will be no bacon shortage. But it might cost a little more at the grocery. Which is fine. I'll just dip into my emergency bacon fund. People laughed at me when I transferred all my 401(k) money into bacon savings, but who's the man now, dog? ""You are, Jarrett!"" ""Hooray! Thanks, bacon!""","Apparently This Matters is CNN Tech's weekly, off-beat look at topics trending on social media .

Stores have been accused of fooling shoppers by selling copycat versions of big-brand favourites to boost profits. Several products, from breakfast cereals to biscuits and beauty creams, bearing an uncanny resemblance to famous names, have been identified. The tactic has been condemned by consumer champion Which?. It found packs with similar names, shapes, colours and designs that mimic popular products, which manufacturers have spent millions of pounds to develop. The examples include Boots anti-dandruff shampoo, where the white bottle and blue cap and lettering look remarkably similar to Head & Shoulders. Similarly, Boots’ vibrant pink bottle for its Fruit Essence shampoo is remarkably like the one for  Clairol’s popular Herbal Essences. Tesco’s tubes of Chipz look very much like the market leaders Pringles, and the pickled onion Beasty Bites from Asda appear to owe much to the look of packs of Monster Munch. The ruse appears to be designed to either fool busy shoppers into picking up the wrong product or piggy-backing on the reputation for quality of mainstream brands. Research among Which? members found one in five had accidentally bought a supermarket version of a product thinking it was a well-known brand. Of these, 38 per cent said they were annoyed by this and 30 per cent felt misled.

Director John Noble said: ‘Brands survive by being distinctive and standing out, and retailers are free-riding on brands’ reputations.’ All the shops identified by  Which? insisted they were confident that consumers were not being misled and could tell the difference between branded and own-label products. Stores such as Boots and Aldi said certain colours were synonymous with particular products or active ingredients, helping shoppers find what they are looking for.

"An Alabama jail has a history of medical negligence so serious that at least three seriously ill inmates have died while incarcerated at the facility, claims a series of lawsuits filed in recent weeks. The suits claim officials at Madison County Jail withheld medical treatment from inmates despite obvious signs that each was critically ill. What's more, the suits allege officials did it just to save a buck. 'They wait and wait and wait and hope it goes away. That's a formula for killing people,' civil rights attorney Hank Sherrod told CNN. Died of gangrene: Deundrez Woods died in Madison County jail in Alabama in 2013 after authorities let a foot infection get so out of hand it killed him, claims a shocking lawsuit . Indifferent medical staff? Nikki Listau died after alcohol withdraw caused her to fall off a bunk an break bones including a femur and was left unattended by medical staff, the suit claims . Sherrod is representing the families of three inmates who died while at Madison County jail's medical-watch area instead of in a hospital receiving medical treatment, where the suit claims they should have been. Sherrod's most shocking claims surround the youngest of the deceased, 19-year-old Deundrez Woods. Woods was booked in June 2013 on shoplifting and assault charges. For weeks, court filings say, the teen seemed fine. But then an infection on his foot became so extreme that it began to have a stench. At first, all the care he received was a hose down from the guards. Not until 'Woods was confused, hallucinating and unable to communicate with correction and medical personnel,' was he taken to the medical unit of the jail, the lawsuit reads. He died of a blood clot from his gangrenous foot 15 days later, reports CNN. During that time, the suit alleges he was left naked and alone in a cell with no water where he didn't eat. 'They just watched him,' Sherrod said. 'They were happy to let him lie there ... totally indifferent to what was really going on.' Rather save a buck? Three lawsuits claim that Madison County Jail in Alabama would rather save a few dollars than pay for critically ill inmates' medical treatment . Sherrod claims the same was true months before for 60-year-old Nikki Listau and two months later for Tanisha Jefferson, 30. Listau was booked on harassment charges in March 2010. Her ensuing alcohol withdrawal was so bad that she had a seizure that caused her to fall off her bunk during the night in a medical watch cell, the suit claims. Never saw a hospital: Tanisha Jefferson complained repeatedly of severe abdominal pain that ended up being a fatal bowel obstruction, the suit sasys . She broke a femur and several ribs during the fall, says the suit, Her court hearing was canceled,, but she was not taken to a hospital. Two hours later the suit says Listau was found unconscious and she died the following day. Jefferson's death came on October 31, 2013 following an arrest for harassment. She first complained of severe abdominal pain and constipation on October 19. Her only medical treatment was a prescription for laxatives before her death, her lawsuit states, despite repeated pleas to jail staff that she feared for her life. 'If I die, it's on y'all,'  the mother of three allegedly told jailers. The suit says that's precisely what happened due to lack of proper medical treatment when she died of a major bowel obstruction . 'What connects them all is that all of these people were in the medical-watch area, supposedly under the care of nurses,' said Sherrod. County attorney Jeff Rich says all three cases are being vigorously defended. The county has declined to comment further on the pending litigation. The suits seek compensatory and punitive damages and legal fees for the families of the three deceased.","A suit filed on behalf of the families of three dead inmates alleges criminally neglectful officials at the Madison County Jail are at fault for their deaths .

"By . James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 18:42 EST, 16 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 22:25 EST, 16 March 2014 . Pledge: George Osborne has vowed to build 120,000 more homes by the end of the decade . The controversial government-backed Help to Buy scheme is to be extended until the end of the decade and the first new garden city for 100 years is to be built in an attempt to boost housebuilding. Chancellor George Osborne revealed yesterday that both measures will be in this week’s Budget, adding that Britain needed to ‘get building’ to secure the economic recovery. The extension of Help to Buy for new properties – which had been due to end in 2016 – to 2020 will support the construction of 120,000 additional homes, he said. The move comes despite suggestions that the Help to Buy scheme could be overheating the housing market, with Bank of England governor Mark Carney keeping a ‘close eye’ on the scheme. Under Help to Buy, the Government lends a prospective home buyer up to 20 per cent of the cost of their new-build home so a buyer needs only a 5 per cent cash deposit and a 75 per cent mortgage to make up the rest. The Chancellor also announced that a garden city will be built at Ebbsfleet in Kent, which will initially provide 15,000 homes. The Chancellor said Britain needs to 'get building' despite Mark Carney warning the scheme is dangerous . Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘We’ve got the lowest level of house-building since the 20s. ‘The Government is not doing enough to invest in affordable homes and the economics of this is if you boost demand with Help to Buy and don’t do enough on supply, the price goes up (and) it’s harder to get into the housing market. ‘If George Osborne really wants to make a difference he would have been much more radical on house-building in the last three years and today – and he’s not been. It’s a damp squib.’ The Local Government Association, which represents almost 400 councils in England and Wales, expressed alarm at the Chancellor’s plans. Chairman Sir Merrick Cockell said: ‘Democratically accountable councils have been at the forefront of delivering local growth and the creation of a separate, remote quango is unnecessary.’ Ed Balls yesterday dumped Labour’s promises to cut VAT and reverse child benefit cuts. The . shadow Chancellor confirmed that a £12billion plan at the centre of the . opposition’s ‘plan for jobs and growth’ – a reduction in VAT to 17.5 . per cent – had been abandoned. And a pledge to restore child benefit to the better-off could also no longer be a ‘priority’. Instead . Labour would use the proceeds of new taxes on banks and bankers’ bonuses – which the Conservatives accuse them of spending ten times over . on different projects – to fund a ‘jobs guarantee’ for the young . unemployed. Ed Balls blasted Osborne's plans while revealing Labour will not prioritise reversing child benefit cuts . Mr Balls also again refused to apologise for Labour’s economic record – denying the last government spent too much money. ‘There was a global financial crisis,’ he said. ‘At . that point, we had the lowest level of national debt of any big country . and George Osborne, the Conservative shadow Chancellor, had matched . Labour’s level of public spending. ‘Am . I going to apologise for the level of public spending that George . Osborne, Alistair Darling and Gordon Brown agreed on in 2007? Absolutely . not.’ Tory MP Sajid Javid . said: ‘It’s the same old Labour – offering no economic plan, just more . spending, more borrowing and more taxes.’","Help To Buy will last until end of decade instead of ending in 2016 .

"Gary Pearce, pictured, messaged and swapped naked photographs with a 14-year-old boy on the Grindr app over the course of several weeks before arranging a meeting for sex . A former teacher who groomed a schoolboy 26 years his junior after they met on gay hook-up app Grindr has been jailed for five years. Gary Pearce messaged and swapped naked photographs with the 14-year-old on the Grindr app over the course of several weeks before arranging a meeting for sex. The boy had been 'curious' when he downloaded the app, which is for over-18s, and then lied about his age to sign up. Pearce, 40, then drove in his sports car to meet the boy in the car park of Asda in Bexleyheath at the end of the summer holidays in 2012. They then went back to Pearce's house in Sidcup, Kent, where he performed sex acts on the teenager. They then showered before Pearce dropped him back at the car park, a court heard. However, the boy's mother discovered messages on her son's mobile phone and confronted him before calling the police. When Pearce was arrested, detectives found four indecent images of children in the trash folder of his computer which had been downloaded sometime around 2009. He admitted picking up the schoolboy and having sex but maintains he thought the boy was over the age of 16 - the age of consent. He made no comment to any other police questions and was charged in July last year. He had denied sexual activity with a child and sexual grooming but was found guilty at Inner London Crown Court. The jury had been shown a video interview given by the boy wearing his school uniform in December 2012 during which he insisted he told Pearce his real age early on. He told detectives 'I said how old I was, I said I was 14 or 15' before the messaging continued. Describing how they eventually met, the boy added: 'He waved at me and I was nervous because obviously I had never done it before. 'I don't remember what we talked about but he put his hand on my leg. I didn't expect it so I jumped but not too much.' They then went to the home and the boy said that he 'showed me around his house' before the pair engaged in a sex act. Gary Pearce, 40, drove in his sports car to meet the boy in the car park of Asda in Bexleyheath (pictured) at the end of the summer holidays in 2012 . Asked how he felt about what had happened during the interview, weeks after meeting Pearce he said: 'Well I now have sort of a girlfriend.' Detective Inspector Neal Burton from the Sapphire Command said: 'Pearce utilised the internet to manipulate the child into meeting him. 'This crime again shows the vulnerability of the internet and social media, which is used by paedophiles to meet their victims. 'This conviction will provide reassurance that we will relentlessly pursue those who commit these dreadful crimes against children.'","Gary Pearce 'groomed' boy after meeting him on gay hook-up app Grindr .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Four southern California teenagers have been charged following the apparent drug overdose death of an 18-year-old high school quarterback whose father is a retired NFL player, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Saturday. Three of the teens have been charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of Griffen Kramer, son of former pro quarterback Erik Kramer, who played for several NFL teams including the Chicago Bears and Detroit Lions, officials said. Griffen Kramer played quarterback at Thousand Oaks High School, which lists him as a 6-foot 210-pound senior. Kramer was found dead October 30 in a friend's bedroom in Agoura Hills, the sheriff's office said in a statement. That friend, David Nemberg, 19, of Agoura Hills, is charged with involuntary manslaughter and possession of a controlled substance, authorities said. After investigating several of Kramer's acquaintances who were involved in narcotics-related activities, police also charged Corey Baumann, 19, also of Agoura Hills, with involuntary manslaughter and possession of a controlled substance for sales, the sheriff's office said. Baumann and Nemberg were each released in lieu of a $125,000 bail, authorities said. The two other accused teenagers are minors, whose names weren't released, the sheriff's office said. A 17-year-old boy from Oak Park, California, was charged with involuntary manslaughter and possession of a controlled substance, the sheriff's office said. He is being held at Sylmar Juvenile Hall without bail, authorities said. Investigators found ""deplorable"" living conditions during the search of the boy's home and took five children from the residence into protective custody, said authorities. The fourth teen, also a 17-year-old boy, of Agoura Hills, was charged with possession of a controlled substance, the sheriff's office said. He was released to his parents' custody, according to police. Police allege Griffen, Nemberg and a juvenile met at Sumac Park in Agoura Hills on October 29 and drove to a nearby cul-de-sac, where Griffen injected narcotics, causing him to instantly become ill and unconscious, authorities said. Nemberg allegedly dragged the unconscious Griffen into his car and then drove him around the area, police said. Nemberg called acquaintances and asked them if he could drive to their residences, but they told him no because their parents were home, police said. Nemberg allegedly took a still unconscious Griffen to Nemberg's home, authorities said. He didn't seek medical attention for Griffen until the next morning, when Nemberg woke up and saw Griffen was still unconscious, authorities alleged. ""He woke up the following morning and called 911 because Griffen was unresponsive,"" Sheriff's Sgt. Barry Hall said in a statement. Griffen was believed to have been dead for several hours before Nemberg made the call, according to the Los Angeles County coroner's office. Investigators believe Griffen had likely died from an overdose, but ""we're still waiting for a toxicology results to determine the ultimate cause of death,"" Hall said. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Griffen Kramer, 18, son of a retired NFL quarterback, dies of apparent overdose .

"A California air tanker smashed into a canyon wall Tuesday afternoon while fighting a wildfire near Yosemite National Park, killing the pilot. Yosemite spokeswoman Ashley Mayer said the aircraft went down at 4.30pm near Arch Rock. Emergency personnel were making their way through difficult terrain to reach the plane's wreckage. ‘We determined there was a crash, but they're still trying to work their way through pretty rugged terrain to determine the status of the pilot,’ said Janet Upton, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. ‘Obviously we're hoping for the best, but the situation is very serious.’ Scroll down for video . Lost: An S-2T air tanker similar to the one pictured here, went down at around 4.30pm Tuesday . At around 11pm pacific time, officials announced the pilot has died. His name has not been released pending the notification of family members. San Francisco Chronicle reported the victim was based out of the Hollister Air Attack Base and was flying Tanker 81. California Highway Patrol Sgt. Chris Michael said he was stopping traffic along state Route 140 at the west entrance to the park about 4.24pm when he witnessed the crash. ‘I heard a large explosion, I looked up on the steep canyon wall and saw aircraft debris was actually raining down the side of the mountain after the impact,’ he told The Associated Press by telephone. ‘It hit the steep side of the canyon wall. It appeared from the direction he was going, he was trying to make a drop down the side of the canyon when he hit the canyon wall.’ The fire was spreading up the canyon wall, and it appeared the pilot was trying to lay down fire retardant to stop its progress, Michael said. ‘It most definitely did disintegrate on impact,’ he said. ‘It was nothing. I didn't see anything but small pieces.’ Pieces of the aircraft landed on the highway and came close to hitting fire crews on the ground nearby, but no one on the ground was injured, he said. ‘It came pretty close to hitting them, but they were far enough away that it missed them, fortunately,’ he said. Smoking wreckage: In this photo provided by Donald Talend, smoke rises from a plane crash near Chinquapin, California . The airplane, manufactured in 2001, is an S-2T air tanker, which is flown by a single pilot and normally has no other crew members. The tanker uses twin turbine engines and is capable of carrying 1,200 gallons of fire retardant, said another CalFire spokesman, Daniel Berlant. Don Talend, of West Dundee, Illinois, said he also may have seen the plane go down. Talend and friends were vacationing at the park when they stopped to snap some photographs of the fire, which was several miles away. The plane ‘disappeared into the smoke and you heard a boom,’ he said. ‘I couldn't believe what I saw. There was actually a ranger there behind us. ... He had a look of disbelief on his face.’ The missing pilot is an employee of DynCorp., a contractor that provides the pilots for all CalFire planes and maintenance for the department's aircraft, Upton said. The fire had broken out about 90 minutes earlier Tuesday near Route 140, which leads into the heart of the park. It had grown to about 130 acres by Tuesday evening and forced the evacuation of several dozen homes near the community of Foresta. Blaze: A wildfire broke near state Highway 140, which leads into the heart of Yosemite National Park. Smoke from the Dog Rock Fire can be seen in this webcam image . The National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration were investigating the crash and were expected to arrive at the crash site Wednesday morning, FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said. FAA records show the plane is registered to the U.S. Forest Service, which originally provided the plane to CalFire, Upton said. The last time a CalFire air tanker crashed was in 2001, when two tankers collided while fighting a fire in Mendocino County, killing both pilots, Berlant said. The agency had another plane crash in 2006, when a fire battalion chief and a pilot were killed while observing a fire in a two-seat plane in Tulare County.","An S-2T air tanker went down at 4.30pm Tuesday near Arch Rock, California .

"At the former concentration camp Auschwitz, Poland  (CNN)Menachem Bodner has been to Auschwitz three times: . First as a child prisoner of just 4 years old. He has only fragments of memories from his time here: Staring out at barbed wire, running down concrete stairs, hiding in a corner.  And one especially vivid memory that still haunts his dreams, the bloodied face of an elderly man. Last year, he visited the German Nazi-run concentration camp as a survivor.  He came for closure and says he felt an overwhelming sense of relief. During the 70-year memorial for the liberation of Auschwitz on Tuesday, he visited the camp in search for his identical twin brother, separated shortly after liberation. ""Sometimes I stare at people in the street, and I look for someone who looks like me,"" he said. ""My biggest hope is my brother will be here. Maybe from another country.  Or maybe another survivor can tell me something, recognize me or remember us both. Anything."" But as he stands in the snow, next to the barbed wire and the brick buildings, his heart pounds.  He turns away to hide his tears. Seventy years ago, Menachem Bodner was known as Elias Gottesman, Auschwitz ID A-7733. Auschwitz records show he had a twin, Jeno Gottesman A-7734. Both were subjected to the medical experiments of Nazi doctor Josef Mengele.  And both survived Auschwitz to be taken into a care home for children after liberation. But Elias was adopted by a man searching for his own wife and children in the chaos and eventually taken to Israel. He was given the new name of Menachem Bodner. What happened to Jeno Gottesman is unknown. For decades, Menachem didn't even know he had a twin.  His only memory came to him in the form of dreams of another boy, blond like him, sleeping in bed beside him. It took nearly 70 years and the help of his genealogist, Ayana KimRon, poring over documents for him to prove his instinct was real. In one sense, she says, his lack of memory is a blessing: . ""I'm really happy for him that he lost his memory."" She told CNN, ""It's so much easier to establish a normal life. But even then, he had nightmares. Just imagine if he remembered."" But it means she must rely on the memories of other survivors to try and track down his twin. ""It's all about the awareness of friends and neighbors. And courage. If he's there and he knows about the search, he'll need some courage to come forward, and then he'll find he has a wonderful family."" Menachem has launched a Facebook Page titled A-7734 in the hope that social media will spread word of his search. There has been progress: A DNA match found Menachem's first cousins in the United States -- the only relatives from his birth family.  They had no idea that Menachem was alive and had assumed that he and his entirely family had perished in Auschwitz.  It was an emotional reunion, and his cousins gave him a gift: the only photo of his birth parents. ""They told me so much about my mother,"" he says, smiling.  ""The most important thing:  Now I know my mother's face.  Before I had remembered only her blond hair. Now I can see her."" But he still searches for Jeno. And he comes to Auschwitz in the hope he will remember some clue, another survivor will recognize him.  Maybe even his own brother. He says he has new dream now: He sees himself walking in a forest with his brother, wearing identical clothes -- black trousers -- and a short sleeve blue shirt. Is it a dream or does he believe it will become a reality? ""Maybe, I don't know.""  He says. But standing in the snow, outside the very building he was held as a prisoner as a young boy, Menachem insists he has not given up.  ""No, not at all."" He says, ""It only makes me want to search for him even more."" In Auschwitz, the place of his nightmares, Menachem still finds hope to dream.","Menachem Bodner, then called  Elias Gottesman, was separated from his twin, Jeno, after liberation .

"The economic crises in Italy appears to have hit the Mafia because there are fewer businesses to extort.

"By . Bianca London . Aside from winning fashion designer of the year and making millions with the Spice Girls, appearing on the cover of UK Vogue for the third time has to be one of Victoria Beckham's greatest career coups. Always known for her immaculately glossy appearance, you'd think the fashion designer would pull out all the stops to ensure she looked picture perfect for her starring role. However, the 40-year-old, who never has so much as a hair out of place, shocked the world when she appeared on the fashion bible wearing a baggy jumper, Wellington boots, and a messy up-do. Scroll down for video . Could YOU look this good in just one minute? Victoria Beckham's beauty team have revealed that it only took a minute to style the designer's hair into its laidback luxe style for her Vogue cover . Stylist Tina Outen, who worked her magic on Victoria's hair for the cover and describes her as 'awesome fun', said the style was a spontaneous decision. 'It probably took less than a minute, it . was just a matter of putting it up, pinning it and playing around with . it to make it look right for her face. 'Victoria knows her face very well . so she knows what suits her, but she's very respectful and trusting. She lets you do your job,' she told Vogue.co.uk. 'The hair for the other cover was . literally created by her getting dressed, getting her hair caught in the . coat and us pulling pieces out and giving it a bit of a finish. That's . how we approached the hair for all of the shots - we just got the . texture right, all looked at it in the mirror and then we just let it . evolve,' she added. Tina explained that Victoria likes to be able to touch her hair and to play with it, hence the laidback luxe look she embraces on the cover, which we will all be copying next season. Opening up about the shoot in a behind the scenes video, Victoria said: ‘I’m never afraid to try something different when I’m working with the best people.’ The . mother-of-four continued: ‘Doing a Vogue shoot is always very exciting – . it’s Vogue and the team, the creative team, the photographer, the hair, . the make-up, the styling, everything is the best.’ The video also features Vogue’s fashion director Lucinda Chalmers who reveals her thought process behind the shoot. Speaking as they shot in Surrey on a rainy day, she said: ‘We want to try do something we haven’t really seen her do before. As we're used to seeing her: The Vogue team said they wanted to try something different on the usually polished Victoria, who was perfectly happy to adhere . ‘She has a very particular look, very . cool, very paired down and what I really wanted to do with her was . really rough her up a bit.’ In between shooting the designer, who is married to David Beckham, revealed a little about her fashion memories. ‘I always loved clothes as a child. I used to really enjoy watching my mother get dressed up,’ she shared. ‘My earliest childhood memory is sitting . on her bed watching her and her attention to detail, putting her . make-up on and doing her hair, she always looked fabulous.’ Quite the difference! Victoria Beckham's first Vogue cover in February 2011 is a far cry from the country chic lady on the August cover . Picking up some tips? Following her Vogue shoot, Victoria was seen at Wimbledon sporting a more messy hairstyle . And talking about how she uses clothes . these days she said: ‘I use clothes to express how I’m feeling myself . and when designing clothes I like to empower women, I want to make them . feel strong and beautiful and confident.’ As the video comes to an end the British . star concludes: ‘What’s next for me? I have my next store opening . hopefully in September in Dover Street in London and I’m opening an . office in New York so I’ve been very, very busy at work, juggling the . work and the kids and David but it’s all good, I feel very blessed, very . lucky and I am having fun.’ See the full film at Vogue.co.uk now and the full shoot in the August issue of Vogue, on sale now.","Victoria, 40, features on cover of Vogue's August issue .

"Aimee Copeland was spending her first night at home Wednesday since flesh-eating bacteria forced the amputation of her hands, leg and foot three months ago. Copeland's first stop out of rehab was to Longhorn Steakhouse for lunch with her family, said her father, Andy. She then went to her parents' house in Snellville, Georgia, and relaxed with her sister, Paige, watching Comedy Central while their parents went shopping. Wednesday night, she will settle into a specially outfitted wing of her parents' home that was built just for her and donated by a local homebuilder. Father: Aimee Copeland using new prosthetics . The 24-year-old University of West Georgia graduate student was out with friends May 1 at the Little Tallapoosa River, about 50 miles west of Atlanta, when the homemade zip line she was holding snapped. She fell and got a gash in her leg that required 22 staples to close. Three days later, still in pain, she went to an emergency room, and doctors eventually determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the flesh-devouring bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila. Doctors had to carry out the amputations in order to save her life. Copeland spent two months in an Augusta, Georgia, hospital before moving to rehab July 2. Andy Copeland said Wednesday his daughter ""loves"" the 1,956-foot wing that was built for her. Pulte Homes, which constructed the addition, says the wing includes a living room, bedroom and bathroom along with a fitness room, sunroom, study room and three outdoor areas. Andy Copeland: 'I have become a better father because of Aimee' The wing also includes access ramps, an elevator, guide rails in the bathroom and a separate wash sink Copeland can use to clean her new prosthetics. Copeland has been working hard on her rehabilitation, determined to live as independently as possible, her father says.

A number of bacteria that are common in the environment but rarely cause serious infections can lead to necrotizing fasciitis, or flesh-eating bacteria syndrome. When the bacteria get into the bloodstream, such as through a cut, doctors typically move aggressively to excise even healthy tissue near the infection site in hopes of ensuring none of the dangerous bacteria remain. The infection attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal about 20% of the time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, estimates that fewer than 250 such cases occur each year in the United States, though estimates are imprecise since doctors do not have to report the cases to health authorities.

"(CNN) -- Under fire from tens of thousands of users, the social networking site Facebook said early Wednesday it is reverting to its old policy on user information -- for now. Backlash against Facebook began after a consumer advocate site flagged Facebook's policy change. The site posted a brief message on users' home pages that said it was returning to its previous ""Terms of Use"" policy ""while we resolve the issues that people have raised."" The ""Terms of Use"" is the legalese tacked on to the bottom of most Web sites that details what the site's owners can do with the information that users provide. Facebook, the Web's most popular social networking site, has been caught in a content-rights battle after revealing earlier this month that it was granting itself permanent rights to users' photos, wall posts and other information even after a user closed an account. The popular site allows users to create personal profiles where they can then connect with one another, upload photos and share links. The site boasts more than 150 million active users. Member backlash against Facebook began over the weekend after a consumer advocate Web site, The Consumerist, flagged a change made to Facebook's policy earlier in the month. The company deleted a sentence from the old Terms of Use. That sentence said Facebook could not claim any rights to original content that a user uploaded once the user closed his or her account. It replaced it with: ""You may remove your User Content from the Site at any time. ... (H)owever, you acknowledge that the Company may retain archived copies of your User Content."" In response, Chris Walters wrote in the Consumerist post, ""Make sure you never upload anything you don't feel comfortable giving away forever, because it's Facebook's now."" Thousands of indignant members either canceled their accounts or created online petitions. Among them were more than 64,000 who joined a group called ""The People Against the new Terms of Service."" iReport.com: Too much information posted online? On Monday, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg tried to quell the controversy by saying the company's philosophy is that ""people own their information and control who they share it with."" But members were not appeased because the site did not fix its Terms of Use. The company, in its post Wednesday, said it was returning to its previous Terms of Use because of the ""feedback"" it had received. ""As Mark expressed in his blog post on Monday, it was never our intention to confuse people or make them uneasy about sharing on Facebook,"" company spokesman Barry Schnitt said in a blog post. ""I also want to be very clear that Facebook does not, nor have we ever, claimed ownership over people's content. Your content belongs to you."" iReport.com: Your thoughts on Facebook's about-face . Schnitt said the company is in the process of rewording its Terms of Use in ""simple language that defines Facebook's rights much more specifically."" ""Well that worked pretty fast,"" wrote member Al Reford of Vancouver, British Columbia. ""Numbers count when giving feedback :)"" And Shahrzad Grami of St. Paul, Minnesota, added: "" YAYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!! nice job guys! i won't be canceling my account after all.""","Facebook this month changed its policy to say user content belonged to Facebook .

A grandmother believed to have been dead for 15 minutes after suffering a heart attack was brought back to life by a paramedic. Moya Stevenson, 53, suffered a severe heart attack on January 16 and was found face down and unconscious on her living room floor after her distress call reached the ambulance service. Paramedic Rick Leonardi, 37, spent 15 minutes massaging and shocking Mrs Stevenson's heart back into action - saving her life. Life saver: Rick Leonardi, 37, found Moya Stevenson, 53, lying face down at her home in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, after he responded to her distress call . She was then rushed to the King's Mill Hospital in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, before being taken to Nottingham City Hospital by Mr Leonardi's colleagues Tony Evans and Liam Waring. On Friday, the grateful grandmother from Sutton-in-Ashfield met her three heroes to say thank you. The mother-of-one said: 'I'm very grateful - It's a strange relationship, as I didn't know Mr Leonardi or the other paramedics but we looked into each others' eyes and I said 'thank you'. It was very emotional. 'If he hadn't got here so quickly and done his job so well, I just wouldn't be here now. 'It's scary to think I was dead for 15 minutes, Mr Leonardi saved my life by doing what he did. 'I can't believe I am still here and I shouldn't have survived this, if you have a full cardiac arrest in a hospital bed you will be lucky to survive, let alone in my own home. 'I owe Mr Leonardi everything, my life. Emergency: Mrs Stevenson was rushed to the King's Mill Hospital in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire . 'I don't remember much from the day, I just remember I woke up in a hospital bed, I stayed in there for three weeks, but it felt like two days. 'The ambulance service don't get enough credit for what they do, they do amazing work. 'My family and friends can't believe I am still alive, no-one can, it is just amazing. I have't come out of this completely unscathed, my right side doesn't react how it used to and it is hard for me to walk, although my brain is fine which is a relief. 'I can hardly concentrate and my memory is hazy. I'm just thankful they were there for me. Mr Leonardi, who has worked for East Midlands Ambulance Service for the past 10 years was first on the scene in his rapid-response vehicle - six minutes after her distress call. He said: 'When I got to her she was unconscious, face-down in her front room. 'It was just me and her. It immediately appeared that she was dead. 'After the third shock, I carried on CPR and managed to get a pulse back. But the prognosis is still very bleak at that point. Time is absolutely of the essence."" After Mr Leonardi had managed to coax some life back into Mrs Stevenson, his colleagues worked an extra two-and-a-half hours to get her to City Hospital and make sure she was safe. Mr Evans said: 'I just wanted to carry it on - I am proud of that, I suppose. 'I wanted to give her the best possible chance of survival. 'It's an honour to be part of the story and to know that what we did made a difference.""

"Hacker group 'Lizard Squad' has claimed responsibility for attacking Sony's online PlayStation store, after the network went down on Sunday night. After taking credit for temporarily disrupting Xbox Live on Friday night, Monday morning the group posted a link to comments regarding the PlayStation Network's online status. It then tweeted: 'PSN Login #offline #LizardSquad.' The PlayStation Knowledge Center continued to show the network's status as online, but users reported issues logging into the system. Hacker group Lizard Squad claimed responsibility for attacking Sony's online PlayStation store . Visitors to the PlayStation store site were met with a message that reads: 'Page Not Found! It's not you. It's the internet's fault.' The disruption is the most recent in a series of attacks on Sony Entertainment, with a cyber attack last month resulting in unreleased movies being leaked online, along with personal information on some 47,000 individuals, including celebrities. A group calling themselves Guardians of Peace froze Sony Pictures' computer systems worldwide, posting a message that warned it would release 'top secrets' unless its 'request be met'. According to website Re/code, Sony and security consultants were investigating the possibility that someone acting on behalf of North Korea, possibly from China, was responsible for the hacking attack. Visitors to the site were met with a message that reads: 'Page Not Found! It's not you. It's the internet's fault' After taking credit for temporarily disrupting Xbox Live on Friday night, the hacker group claimed responsibility for the most recent attack on Sony Entertainmant . North Korea denied involvement, but praised the attack as a 'righteous deed'. The hack came just under a month before Sony Pictures was due to release The Interview - a comedy about two journalists, played by Seth Rogen and James Franco, who are recruited by the CIA to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. It is unclear exactly who or what Lizard Squad are or what they are demanding. The group communicates through Twitter - usually posting messages warning of upcoming attacks or flagging up current ones. Various reports suggest that the group is based in Russia - although this has not been proved. A link on the Lizard Squad Twitter page, leading to a chat room login - was originally Russian-based domain. The group has claimed responsibility for a string of attacks on targets including EA games, Destiny, Twitch and World of Warcraft. The Pyongyang government denounced the film as 'undisguised sponsoring of terrorism, as well as an act of war' in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in June. In a further cyber threat on Friday, Sony Pictures staff received an email claiming to be from the same hackers, reportedly with warnings that they and their families were 'in danger.' The email also warned that 'all hope will leave you and Sony Pictures will collapse', according to the industry journal Variety. Sony Pictures described the hack attack a 'brazen' effort, but said it did not yet know the full extent of the 'malicious' security breach. On the same day, Xbox Live was hit with a DDOS - or a distributed denial of service attack - which overloaded the system with requests until it shut down, preventing users from getting online. Lizard Squad, which is known for using DDOS in its attacks, claims to be behind the outage. The group has taken responsibility for taking offline other high-profile targets in the past including EA games, Destiny, Twitch and online game World of Warcraft. On Twitter, Lizard Squad warned that the attack on Xbox was 'a small dose' of what is to come this this Christmas. The PlayStation Knowledge Center continued to show the network's status as online, but users reported issues logging into the Playstation Network system .

The terrifying incident was captured by CCTV cameras and the video shows the man elbowing a child in the head and tossing another to the pavement. NYPD said the violent scene unfolded after the man tried to sexually assault the mother in front of her children. The video shows a man carrying a child from the driver’s side of a car before confronting the 26-year-old mother, who is holding a one-year-old child in her arms. The man and the mother are struggling near the rear passenger side door when he suddenly elbows the five-year-old child in the head, knocking him or her to the floor. With the mother attempting to intervene, the man pulls the child out of the backseat and tosses him or her to the pavement before climbing back into the car and driving off.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:10 EST, 30 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:08 EST, 30 September 2013 . Three young blind people from Phoenix, Arizona, have conquered yet another dream that most would deem unrealistic due to their visual impairment. Max Ashton, 17, Tanner Robinson, 24, and Katie Cupp, 19 completed the arduous Alcatraz Invitational Swim through the rough waters between Alcatraz Island and Aquatic Park in San Francisco, California, on Sunday. With the help of sighted swimming guides, Ashton came in first, swimming the 1.25-mile distance in just a little over 50 minutes. Blind and brave: Max Ashton, 17, (right) swam from Alcatraz to the San Francisco mainland as the first blind person. He was guided by Paul Tiffany (left) during the swim . With a little help: Ashton, middle, and his two sighted guides - the Tiffany brothers Mike, left, and Paul, right . Finish line: Swimmers participating in the Alcatraz Invitational Swim were greeted by friends and family at Aquatic Park on Sunday . Record: Ashton, right, completed the swim in a little over 50 minutes, the first blind person to do so . Ice-cold waters: It's a long and tedious swim from Alcatraz Island to the San Francisco mainland . The hardest part of making the swim is staying on a straight line, so Ashton was guided by two brothers, Mike and Paul Tiffany, both of Phoenix, who made sure he did not veer off course. The brothers said the trip was uneventful, although Ashton clocked one of them when he swam too close. ‘I took a couple of shots in the face from Max,’ said Paul, who has made a total of six Alcatraz swims. According to Ashton, it feels ‘good to show people I can do everything, really', he said after making it across the bay. ‘I feel great now. This is huge. Next is college.’ This is not the first time the high school college prep senior has done ‘the impossible’. When he was 13, he climbed Kenya’s Mount Kilimanjaro, and a year later he crossed the Grand Canyon. The two others who also did the swim, Robinson and Cuppy, were both happy they did it. Made it! Visually-impaired Tanner Robinson, 24, (second from right) is greeted by his teammates after completing the swim from Alcatraz . Escape from Alcatraz: The island with its prison was once deemed impossible to escape from . Robinson has also climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro and made the rim-to-rim trek across the Grand Canyon together with Ashton in fundraising events put on by the Phoenix-based Foundation for Blind Children. However, the bay swim was ‘the hardest one’ of the challenges, he told the San Francisco Chronicle. Between 1933 and 1963, the U.S. government sent some of its most dangerous criminals to Alcatraz Island, including the likes of Al Capone, Machine Gun Kelly and Whitey Bulgar. The current in the San Francisco Bay is often strong and unpredictable, which is why of the 36 prison inmates who tried to escape, only six made it out of the waters alive. Robinson, who works at the secretary of state's office in Arizona, finished in an hour and 16 minutes. Happy: Katie Cuppy, 19, who is also blind, is helped up from the water after finishing the swim in one hour and 24 minutes . Nothing is impossible: Cuppy, who is studying special education, says blind people can do anything that a sighted person can . Robinson said he kept going, despite the . cold water and his novice status as a swimmer, thanks to months of . training at Arizona's Lake Pleasant. ‘The nice thing about being blind is you don't know where the finish line is,’ he said. ‘It was just like another training.’ Cuppy, who is studying special education and hopes to teach blind children, did the swim in one hour and 24 minutes. ‘This shows we can do anything else a sighted person can do, without limits,’ she said.","Max Ashton, 17, from Phoenix, Arizona, did the swim between Alcatraz and San Francisco's Aquatic Park in 50 minutes .

"Parliamentary computers are being used to view hardcore pornography featuring sadomasochism and foot and fat fetishism. The X-rated websites have been accessed more than 2,500 times on computers used by MPs, peers and their staff. Gay cruising websites have also been visited a further 3,500 times along with obscure erotica sites – including one showing naked women posing with cats. Exposed: X-rated websites have been accessed more than 2,500 times on computers used by MPs, peers and their staff . Asked for an explanation, a  parliamentary spokesman claimed the sites may have been visited accidentally. The Mail on Sunday obtained the information through a Freedom of Information enquiry. It covers a 14-month period between May 2011 and July 2012. The visits are a breach of parliamentary IT rules, which bar online ‘pornography’, ‘nudity’  and ‘adult/mature content’. It follows the revelation in this newspaper earlier this month that parliamentary computers were used to click thousands of times on a website that encourages adulterous affairs. Harry Potter, a barrister specialising in obscenity cases, said: ‘Having viewed the material, it does not in my opinion fall foul of the law as constituting extreme pornography. It is, however, undoubtedly hardcore pornography.’ A variety of foot fetish websites – which include pornographic images of lurid sex acts involving feet – have been viewed 470 times. Another website featuring an array of pictures of naked women lying next to cats has been viewed 17 times. A Polish pornography website was accessed 292 times in May 2011. In the same month a dating website was clicked on 653 times. The website boasts it is ‘dedicated to connecting fun-loving singles across the UK’. The Parliament IT firewall is supposed to block ‘personals/dating’ websites. However, in addition to the 2,549 clicks on porn sites, gay cruising websites have been visited 3,459 times. Shamed: The Mail On Sunday's exclusive report revealed that Out Of Town Affairs, a website that brings together married men and women seeking sex, was clicked on 52,375 times in seven months on Parliament computers . A gay dating website was accessed 2,828 times in May 2011. The website states it provides a ‘platform for the gay and bisexual male and transgender community’. Another website that allows users to pick which MPs have  ‘the most sex-appeal’ has been clicked on 12,371 times. A sex-toy shopping website was also visited. Earlier this month, The Mail on Sunday revealed that Out Of Town Affairs, a website that brings together married men and women seeking sex, was clicked on 52,375 times in seven months on Parliament computers. Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Many people working in Parliament are spending far too much time surfing websites that have nothing to do with their jobs. What’s more, this evidence suggests codes of conduct are being breached. ‘It is vital that taxpayers are able to scrutinise how time they are paying for is spent and that anyone caught breaking the rules is appropriately punished.’ A Parliament spokeswoman said it was possible the sites were visited accidentally. She said: ‘A user may access a site that contains optional or automatic links to another which are recorded without active connection. ‘But where there is trustworthy evidence that an employee has breached the acceptable use policy, it is treated as an issue subject to disciplinary procedures. ‘However, direct employees of Parliament are not the only users of the parliamentary network.’ Discipline: A Parliament spokeswoman said it was possible the sites were visited accidentally, but were an employee to breach the acceptable use policy they would be subject to disciplinary procedures .","Parliamentary computers used to look at foot and fat fetishism .

"SAN ANTONIO, Texas (CNN) -- Last week in an operating room in Texas, a wounded American soldier underwent a history-making procedure that could help him regrow the finger that was lost to a bomb attack in Baghdad, Iraq, last year. Army Sgt. Shiloh Harris is wheeled into surgery for the experimental treatment to regrow what's left of his finger. Army Sgt. Shiloh Harris' doctors applied specially formulated powder to what's left of the finger in an effort to do for wounded soldiers what salamanders can do naturally: replace missing body parts. If it sounds like science fiction, the lead surgeon agreed. ""It is. But science fiction eventually becomes true, doesn't it?"" asked Dr. Steven Wolf of Brooke Army Medical Center. Harris' surgery is part of a major medical study of ""regenerative medicine"" being pursued by the Pentagon and several of the nation's top medical facilities, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the Cleveland Clinic. Nearly $250 million has been dedicated to the research. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Israel Del Toro is one of the wounded vets who might one day benefit from this research. He was injured by a bomb in Afghanistan. Both his hands were badly burned. On his left hand, what was left of his fingers fused together. ""You know, in the beginning, when I first got hurt, I told them, just cut it off. So I can get some function,"" Del Toro said. His doctors did not cut off his injured left arm. And since that injury, advancements in burn and amputation treatment mean he may one day be able to use his fingers again.  Watch more on regenerative medicine » . A key to the research dedicated to regrowing fingers and other body parts is a powder, nicknamed ""pixie dust"" by some of the people at Brooke. It's made from tissue extracted from pigs. The pixie dust powder itself doesn't regrow the missing tissue; it tricks the patient's body into doing that itself. All bodies have stem cells. As we are developing in our mothers' wombs, those stem cells grow our fingers, toes, organs -- essentially, our whole body. The stem cells stop doing that around birth, but they don't go away. The researchers believe that the ""pixie dust"" can put those stem cells back to work growing new body parts. The powder forms a microscopic ""scaffold"" that attracts stem cells and convinces them to grow into the tissue that used to be there. ""If it is next to the skin, it will start making skin. If it's next to a tendon, it will start making a tendon, and so that's the hope, at least in this particular project, that we can grow a finger,"" Wolf said. It has worked in earlier experiments. ""They have taken a uterus out of a dog, made one in the lab, put it back in and had puppies,"" Wolf said. Researchers have also regrown a human bladder and implanted it in a person, and it is working as nature intended. Although the technique has incredible promise, doctors will be watching for unexpected side effects as they follow Harris' recovery. ""It could grow a cancer,"" Wolf said. ""We will be closely monitoring for that to make sure that doesn't happen."" If the military's most badly wounded start benefiting, so will civilians. ""If we can pull this off in missing parts the next step is, OK, can we grow a pancreas? Can we grow and replace that in a diabetic? And can we do the same thing with a kidney and can we do the same thing with a heart?"" One day, he hopes, people with heart trouble will be told, ""That's OK. We will just grow you another one."" ""That is something that is real science fiction.""

"(CNN) -- The pilot and co-pilot aboard a FedEx cargo plane were killed when the plane burst into flames Monday while landing at Tokyo's Narita airport in Japan, airport and hospital officials said. Smoke rises from a FedEx cargo plane that crash landed on the tarmac of the Narita International Airport, Tokyo. Both crew members were American men, an official at Narita Red Cross Hospital told CNN. Video from the landing showed the plane bouncing at least twice on the runway and veering left as it turned on its side before bursting into flames. The fire destroyed the aircraft, which was identified by FedEx as a McDonnell Douglas MD-11. Japan's Ministry of Transport said it was the first fatal crash at Narita, which opened in 1978. Strong winds may have played a role in the crash, said Masaru Fujisaki, an airport official. FedEx Express Flight 80 took off from Guangzhou, China, and crashed at Narita about 7 a.m. Monday (6 p.m. Sunday ET), said FedEx spokesman Matt Ceniceros.

The poll of 4,000 adults by Cancer Research UK found 55 per cent have made New Year's resolutions in the past, and 23 per cent have made a resolution for 2013. When asked how long previous New Year's resolutions had lasted, nine per cent said they stuck to them for at least six months. However, 39 per cent had given up within two weeks. Of those that plan to or are thinking about giving something up for 2013, 19 per cent said they would cut down on alcohol. Other popular New Year's resolutions were to spend less money (34 per cent), cut down on chocolate (21 per cent), and go to the gym (22 per cent). Cancer Research UK is looking for volunteers to sign up for its new fundraising campaign, Dryathlon(TM), which is encouraging people nationwide to test their willpower and take the challenge of staying off alcohol for January, raising money for a good cause at the same time. Ed Aspel, Head of Dryathlon at Cancer . Research UK, said: 'We wanted to find out how good the great British . public are at sticking to those fabled New Year's Resolutions, which it . turns out we find harder to stick to than we might think. 'We'd encourage the fifth of us . who already plan to cut down on alcohol to go one step further and give . Dryathlon a go - by raising some much needed cash to help beat cancer, . you'll have an even better reason to make it past the two week mark and . stick to the Resolution for the whole of January.' Cancer Research UK is looking for volunteers to sign up for its new fundraising campaign, Dryathlon(TM), which is encouraging people  to test their willpower and take the challenge of staying off alcohol for January, raising money for a good cause at the same time . 1. CHOOSE ONE THING - to start, pick . one habit that will have the biggest impact on your life if changed and . focus on it. Planning to hit the gym, give up Facebook and eat better . all at once is taking on too much, according to research carried out by . BJ Fogg, a psychologist and author of Persuasive Technology. Do the . first thing for a month, then you can add more changes. 2. MAKE IT EASY - don't start by . planning to train for an hour every day or eat nothing but meat and veg . if that's a huge change in your habits. It won't happen. 'If you're . working out, aim for five to ten minutes a day,' says Leo Babauta, . author of The Power Of Less. 'If you're planning to de-clutter your . home, start with one drawer rather than your whole house.' The positive . feedback from these tiny goals will help you tackle bigger tasks later. 3. IGNORE THE NEGATIVES - focusing . on what you're not going to do can lead to a 'behavioural ironic . rebound' - or, more simply, if you resolve to stop eating cake, you'll . eat more cake. According to research from Utrecht University in the . Netherlands, you should focus on positives rather than negatives, such . as resolving to eat more veg and protein. 4. USE IF/THEN PATTERNS - . programme your brain as you would a computer and you won't need to . wrestle with temptation all the time, says Professor Mark Conner of the . University of Leeds. 'Set up cues that prompt your planned behaviour,' he suggests. For instance, 'if I feel hungry before lunch then I will . eat an apple, not a chocolate bar'. Conserving willpower in this way . also means you'll have more left over for other things. 5. GET HELP - joining forces with a . partner boosts your chances of sticking to your resolutions, according . to Conner's research. When groups were told to make if/then plans with . and without the help of friends, those who used a support group saw . vastly increased chances of success. And besides, you'll need someone to . spot you on the bench.","Almost a fifth pledge to cut back on alcohol .

"Washington (CNN) -- Victims and families of those killed in the Fort Hood massacre are asking compensation totaling $750 million from the government for failing to stop the attack. Eighty-three administrative claims were filed last week, saying the Army, the FBI, and the Justice and Defense departments are guilty of gross and willful negligence for not recognizing that the man charged in the shootings, Maj. Nidal Hasan, was a threat. ""Although they had clear knowledge and warnings that Hasan posed a grave danger to the lives and safety of soldiers and civilians with whom he came into contact, they did nothing to eliminate the known risk posed by him,"" the ""basis of claim"" document alleges. ""On the contrary, bowing to 'political correctness,' the DOD, DOA (Department of the Army), DOJ, and FBI, in wanton disregard of the safety of military and civilian personnel, intentionally ignored the threat he presented,"" says the document, which was attached to each of the 83 claims. Hasan is charged with killing 13 people and wounding dozens more in the killing spree at a medical building at Fort Hood, Texas, on November 5, 2009, where soldiers were screened before deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan. His court martial, in which prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, is set to begin March 5. Hasan has not entered a plea. The lawyer handling the compensation claim, Neal Sher, said the next step depends on the government. ""The Army is taking the lead,"" Sher told CNN. ""They have six months either to deny the claim or satisfactorily resolve it."" After that, the case could move into federal court. Since immediately following the attacks there have been widespread questions about how Hasan was evaluated, promoted and transferred to Fort Hood with plans to deploy to Afghanistan despite questions about his ideology and stability. A congressional report labeled him ""a smoking gun,"" and ripped into the government for not sounding an alarm. ""Although neither the Department of Defense nor the FBI had specific information concerning the time, place, or nature of the attack, they collectively had sufficient information to have detected Hasan's radicalization to violent Islamist extremism but failed both to understand and to act on it,"" said the report from Sens. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, and Susan Collins, R-Maine. ""Our investigation found specific and systemic failures in the government's handling of the Hasan case and raises additional concerns about what may be broader systemic issues,"" it said. The government refuses to confirm reports that U.S. intelligence agencies had monitored Hasan's e-mail contacts with American-born radical Anwar al-Awlaki, who in September was killed by an American drone attack in Yemen. ""It is a tragic irony that our government sought out and killed al-Awlaki, while Hasan was promoted in the Army and put in a position to carry out his murderous terror attack,"" attorney Sher had said in an earlier statement. ""It is a sad commentary on our avowed war on terror that the government deliberately refused to take even minimal steps to neutralize the clear threat posed by Hasan, who made no secret of, and actually boasted about, his anti-American and jihadist views."" Victims and witnesses identified Hasan as the shooter during a preliminary hearing at Fort Hood last year. They described the mayhem inside the building, floors slick with blood as the gunman fired more than 150 rounds and methodically reloaded his handgun. Hasan was shot and partially paralyzed in a shootout with police. A Fort Hood spokesman acknowledged that the compensation claims had been filed. ""We are aware of the cases but are not able to speak to the specifics,"" spokesman Tyler Broadway said in an e-mail. ""The cases will be taken seriously and will follow due process.""","83 claims have been filed by those wounded and the families of those killed at Fort Hood .

"It has fired the imagination of historians and archaeologists for centuries, but the mystery of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon may finally have been solved - with a surprising twist. A leading Oxford-based historian says the fabled gardens, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, were not built in Hillah by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. In fact they weren’t in Babylon at all. Dr Stephanie Dalley, of Oxford University’s Oriental Institute, says the gardens were actually located 300 miles to the north in Nineveh, Babylon's rival, by the Assyrian ruler Sennacherib. Glory of the ancients: A sixteenth century illustration of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, which may not have been in Babylon at all. An Oxford historian claims they were actually built in the Assyrian city of Nineveh . She first put the proposal forward in 1992 and has spent 20 years piecing the mystery together, reports The Independent. There are four key components of Dr Dalley's theory, which will be outlined in a book released later this month. As she studied historical descriptions of the gardens, she discovered that a nineteenth century bas-relief from Sennacherib’s palace in Nineveh showed trees growing on a roofed colonnade exactly as described by early accounts. Secondly, Nineveh, the Assyrian capital, became known as 'New Babylon' when Assyria conquered Babylon in 689 BC - in fact, a number of places in the region were known by the name 'Babylon'. She also discovered that the gates of Nineveh were renamed for those traditionally used for Babylon’s city gates after the successful invasion. Thirdly, a geographical assessment found that the flat land surrounding Babylon would have made delivering water to the Hanging Gardens impossible. Hillah in modern-day Iraq was thought to be the site of the Hanging Gardens. Dr Dalley's research shows it may actually have been in Nineveh, 300 miles away . Finally, she believes that the original classical descriptions of the Hanging Gardens were written by historians who had actually visited the Nineveh area, including accounts from Alexander the Great, whose army camped near the city in 331BC, close to one of the great aqueducts that carried water to what Dr Dalley now believes to be the real site of the Hanging Gardens. She said: 'It’s taken many years to find the evidence to demonstrate that the gardens and associated system of aqueducts and canals were built by Sennacherib at Nineveh and not by Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon. 'For the first time it can be shown that the Hanging Garden really did exist.' Incredibly, the revelations may mean that the Hanging Gardens were the first of the seven ‘wonders’ of the world to be described as such. Sennacherib referred to his palace gardens, as 'a wonder for all the peoples'. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the . Ancient World, and the only one that may have been pure . legend. Accounts state they were built in the ancient city-state of Babylon, near present-day Hillah, Babil province, in Iraq. The . gardens were attributed to the Neo-Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II, . who ruled between 605 and 562 BC. He is reported to have constructed the . gardens to please his wife Amytis of Media, who was said to pine for the plants of her homeland. It is not known what happened to the gardens. Some theorise it was levelled by an earthquake. The . Hanging Gardens of Babylon are documented by ancient Greek and Roman . writers, including Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, and Quintus Curtius Rufus. Romano-Jewish historian Josephus once described it. He said: 'In this palace he (Nebuchadnezzar) erected very high walks, supported by stone pillars; and by planting what was called a pensile paradise, and replenishing it with all sorts of trees, he rendered the prospect an exact resemblance of a mountainous country. 'This he did to gratify his queen, because she had been brought up in Media, and was fond of a mountainous situation.' However, no definitive archaeological evidence concerning their whereabouts has been found.","Prominent historian claims lost Ancient Wonder was not built in Babylon .

"Christian Wade's wonder try against Leinster in Dublin on Sunday is unlikely to earn him an immediate England recall, but the Wasps wing believes it will reignite his game after a difficult year. The 23-year-old brought the house down at the RDS Arena by leaving three opponents in his slipstream to produce a glorious solo strike in his club’s European Champions Cup defeat. Hours later, he was feted by Irish and English fans alike as he walked through Dublin airport with his team-mates, but it is understood that his latest scoring feat has not convinced the England coaches to include him in their autumn Test squad. Christian Wade of Wasps breaks clear to score a try against Leinster but will not be recalled by England . Sportsmail has learned that Wade is due to be included in the Saxons squad and will have to bide his time in the hope of winning a second international cap. But having missed most of last season with a foot injury which proved tough to overcome, the Lion feels that his try on Sunday will serve to kick-start his game again. ‘I was really excited and happy to score,’ he said. ‘Scoring tries like that makes me feel like my old self again and that will give me real confidence going forward. I’ve just got to play as much rugby as I can and see what else I produce. ‘For me it’s been a difficult last year really. I had the injury and was out for about nine months. In the first few games I played after that I was obviously trying to feel my way back into it. I wasn’t holding back, I was trying to do my best but I was making mistakes. I have kept trying to get better every week and put some good performances together.’W . Wade made his one and only England appearance against Argentina in June last year . Recalling his blistering run to the line, Wade added: ‘It was in broken-field play and the boys got it out to me. I had a bit of space and I think it was Madigan who was in front of me. I had a one-on-one with him and I was able to stand him up, get on the outside and from there it was straight run – a race into the corner. ‘For wingers, our main job is to finish off tries and also to get over the gainline. That is something that I have always done but I know that I can’t just rely on scoring tries – I also have to have the right defensive mind-set. I know that as a winger I have to be good at defending, at the wide breakdowns, the high balls and the kick-chase. I have to make sure I get my all-round game right.’ Wade is destined to miss out when Stuart Lancaster names his autumn squad on Wednesday. Wing is among the most open areas of the field in terms of England selection, with Marland Yarde, Chris Ashton, Jack Nowell and Anthony Watson believed to be the leading four candidates, while Semesa Rokoduguni and Jonny May are also in the mix.","Christian Wade burst back on to the scene with a wonder try for Wasps .

"A video allegedly showing Mohamed Al Alami's funeral was posted online last week . A former Guantanamo Bay prisoner who fought against British and US forces in Afghanistan has been killed while fighting for Al Qaeda in Syria. Mohammed Al Alami was released from the top-security detention centre in 2006 after convincing officials that he was no longer a threat to the West. The 37-year-old, who spent four years in custody, claimed he confessed to being a terrorist only after being beaten and threatened with death. But it has now been revealed that he was killed last month while fighting for Al Nusra Front, one of the most violent and ruthless Islamic groups in Syria. A video posted on YouTube last week showed a funeral in which Alami is praised by a rebel leader for enduring ‘the prison of the Americans in  Guantanamo... where he did not reform or change’. The disclosure will further fuel concerns that Britain and the United States should not become embroiled in Syria’s civil war, in which Al Qaeda-affiliated groups are playing an increasingly prominent role, with hundreds of rebel fighters reportedly defecting to them. Western intelligence agencies including MI6 and the CIA fear that any weapons sent to bring down the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad could used to attack the West in the future. One official said last night that, in addition to the defections, Syria had experienced a ‘massive influx’ of  Islamists seeking jihad in recent months. The official added: ‘Volunteers have come from Chechnya, Iraq, Tunisia, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Australia and even Britain. We are now seeing in-fighting between various rebel groups and the Islamists may soon become the dominant force.’ Rebels: what started out as a unified force fighting the rule of Bashar Al Assad has splintered into warring factions allowing Islamist groups like Al Qaeda to move in . Conflict: Western nations appalled at Assad's alleged use of chemical weapons are hesitant about arming rebel forces in case they accidentally put guns in the hands of terrorists . Moroccan-born Alami confessed to fighting against US and British Special Forces in Afghanistan shortly after the September 11 attacks. He was captured three months later, following the fall of the Taliban, while attempting to cross into Pakistan. He was handed over to the CIA before being flown out of Afghanistan, dressed in an orange jumpsuit and manacled to the floor of a US transport aircraft. During his interrogation, which is believed to have taken place at the covert CIA prison in Bagram airbase, Alami admitted being a  member of Al Qaeda. Peace: US Secretary of State John Kerry (pictured left) has agreed to a peace plan put forward by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov which would see Assad hand over his stockpiles of chemical weapons . The news that an Al Qaeda fighter has been killed will back up campaigners who say there is no need to get involved in Syria's complicated civil war . He said he attended the Al Farouq paramilitary camp in Afghanistan where he saw Osama Bin Laden, who was there ‘to encourage and reinforce the trainees’ commitment to the cause of jihad’. Along with dozens of other terrorist suspects, Alami was transferred to Guantanamo Bay in February 2002 and was detained at the notorious Camp X-Ray for several weeks before being moved to another detention centre on the same site. But he later recanted the claim that he had been trained by Al Qaeda and said that he had confessed only after being beaten and threatened. Pentagon records and documents released via the WikiLeaks website reveal that Alami was released in 2006. The documents also state that Guantanamo commander Major General Geoffrey Miller opposed the move. Experts say that former Guantanamo prisoners are viewed as heroes  by Islamist fighters in Syria for  keeping faith in their cause during their detention. Last night, a White House spokesman said: ‘We are aware of reports that a former Guantanamo detainee has died in the fighting in Syria.’","Video apparently showing Mohammed Al Alami's funeral was posted online .

"By . Hannah Roberts . Fears for the health of Pope Francis have surfaced, after he cancelled two days of engagements . Fears for the health of Pope Francis have surfaced, after he cancelled two days of engagements. Following an intense working weekend, the 77-year-old decided not to hold Mass in Santa Marta this morning and cancelled his appointments for the rest of the day. He had already had advisors clear his schedule yesterday to rest, after hosting a diplomatically tricky prayer meeting with the Israeli and Palestinian presidents on Sunday. A few weeks ago he called off a visit to a Marian shrine near Rome ‘lighten his schedule’ before his three day trip to the Holy land. He has previously cancelled engagements because of a cold, or a light fever. The Vatican said:'Following a very historic and full weekend, the Holy Father has chosen to rest on Monday afternoon and today Tuesday.' His condition is 'not serious' the Holy See said. Vatican spokesman Fr Federico Lombardi said the two day absence was 'nothing to worry about.' The pope, who rises at 4.30am every day has kept up a whirlwind of activity since his election more than a year ago, but his advisers are hoping that he will take some time off this summer. Close collaborator Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga of Honduras said: 'We have been asking him to have holidays this year.' 'Because last year he didn’t and sometimes he’s very tired.' 'So I think that during August he’s going to retire to rest.' He had already had advisors clear his schedule yesterday to rest, after hosting a diplomatically tricky prayer meeting with the Israeli and Palestinian presidents on Sunday . Traditionally popes moved to the papal summer palace at Castel Gandolfo outside Rome during the summer months. Last year Francis worked straight through the summer.Papal aides reportedly say that Francis thrives off a fast pace and 'eats work,' and finds it hard to relinquish control to others. But he has some underlying health problems, including sciatica, a back problem and is missing most of one lung due to an infection in his youth. Some observers have claimed the pontiff has gained weight since his election and is having difficulty breathing, which could be a sign of a heart condition.

"One of America's richest businessmen has denied claims that he was detained following a car accident in Cuba after 'hitting a local kid with his car'. Daniel S. Loeb, the hedge fund manager who founded Third Point LLC, was involved in an accident while enjoying a weekend trip to Cuba, according to Vanity Fair. The piece, written for the magazine's December edition, alleges that the incident happened while Loeb, 51, was on holiday with friends in 2002. But Mr Loeb's lawyer told the New York Post that the allegations are 'entirely untrue'. Firm denial: Lawyers representing hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb, pictured, have denied that he 'hit a local kid' in a car in Cuba in 2002 . Mr Loeb is number 341 on the Forbes 400 list of America's richest people and is said to be worth $1.65billion (£1.02billion). In the Vanity Fair piece William D. Cohan claims that Mr Loeb was accompanied on the trip by his friend Alexander von Furstenberg. But Mr Cohan writes that 'things unexpectedly took a dark turn.' According to vanity Fair, former Third Point analyst Youlia Miteva, who accused Loeb of breach of contract in a lawsuit, said: 'Cuban authorities had refused to allow him to leave'.' Mr Cohan adds that earlier this year, while compiling a separate Vanity Fair piece, Mr Loeb told him that he had been involved in a car accident, and 'stuck around' for a couple of weeks before a legal hearing. Controversy: Hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb has criticised Sony for two film flops this summer . The article adds that a former friend of Loeb, hedge funder Robert Chapman Jr told Cohan that Loeb had called him 'desperate' and 'sobbing' from a hotel room in Cuba. He told Mr Cohan 'how scared' Loeb had sounded when giving details of the incident 'involving his hitting a Cuban kid with his car'. According to the New York Post, Mr Loeb's art dealer friend Christophe Van de Weghe, who claims to have been in Cuba at the time of the accident, denies that Loeb ever spent any time in prison. Mr Loeb's lawyer told the Post: 'The statements you attribute to Mr Chapman, Gross and an 'unidentified source' are entirely untrue, defamatory and libelous, and will be treated as such.' MailOnline has attempted to contact Third Point and Mr Loeb's lawyer and is awaiting a response. Mr Loeb hit the headlines earlier this year when actor George Clooney hit out at 'inflammatory' comments the hedge fund manager made about the movie industry. In an interview with Deadline.com, the star called billionaire Loeb a 'carpetbagger', claiming the Wall Street tycoon 'knows nothing' about the film business. Loeb's Third Point hedge fund controls seven percent of Sony stock and he had criticised Sony Entertainment after its two big budget films After Earth and White House Down, 'bombed spectacularly' at the box office.

"Brendan Rodgers has admitted Manchester City will have a massive advantage when Liverpool relaunch their push for a Champions League place this weekend. Liverpool face the reigning champions at Anfield on Sunday but the game will start at 12pm - which is just 57 hours after they return from their Europa League tie in Istanbul. Rodgers has been forced to shuffle his pack coming out here to Turkey, as an ankle injury to Jordan Henderson and his decision to rest Philippe Coutinho means he is without 10 senior players, as Liverpool look to protect a 1-0 first leg lead. Brendan Rodgers believes Manchester City will have a major advantage over his Liverpool side . Liverpool will not get back from Istanbul until at least 3am on Friday and Rodgers is concerned that City - who faced Barcelona on Tuesday - will be fresher and fitter for what could prove to be a decisive game in the battle to secure a top four spot. 'That extra period of 48 hours that they (City) will have could be crucial, certainly physically,' said Rodgers. 'Especially as we don’t get back until 3am we will have very little preparation time. 'It’ll just be about recovery. We can’ t train on the pitch at Anfield (on Friday night), we can’t make it any worse than it is, so we’re having to train the next day (at Melwood). Liverpool will be without key men Jordan Henderson (left) and Philippe Coutinho for the clash . 'Sometimes you can get back and train later that day, it doesn't help us. But look, it’s the way it’s been dealt and we’ll deal with it the best we can. The players have had lots of challenges to overcome this season and we are ready to keep performing and doing the best we can.' When asked if this showed how difficult the demands of the Europa League is, Rodgers replied. 'Especially if you don’t get help, when we are on when we are, early on the Sunday. It is still a European competition. I would rather be in it than not in it. 'We are playing a lot of games this season because we had a successful couple of games, we are doing well, we are in a couple of competitions and if we want to maintain that and work well for the coming years we have to get used to a lot of games. Mario Balotelli (right) in action during a training session at Melwood Training Ground on Wednesday . 'It is unfortunate but we will do our best.' Rodgers hopes Henderson will be fit to face City, while Steven Gerrard could also feature as his recovery from a hamstring problem has gone smoothly.' Coutinho - who scored a stunning goal at Southampton last weekend - will certainly play as Rodgers felt this was an appropriate juncture to take the Brazilian out, given he has has just made 19 consecutive appearances. 'I’ve had to bring out young Coutinho,' said Rodgers. 'He hasn’t travelled. He’ s an outstanding young player for us, a key player for us and he’s played a lot of game consecutively for us now. 'This was a game that I’d earmarked to give some recovery in knowing he can stay at home, not travel and prepare and get ready for the weekend.'

"(CNN)  -- AC Milan went top of Serie A for the first time this season with a 3-1 victory over Palermo in the San Siro as previous leaders Lazio lost 1-0 at newly-promoted Cesena Wednesday. Pato opened the scoring for Milan before Armin Bacinovic equalized for the Sicilians but a Zlatan Ibrahimovic penalty and late Robinho third gave Milan a comfortable win. Their joy was complete as city rivals and reigning champions Inter were held to a 1-1 draw at Lecce and drop to fourth. Diego Milito scored ony his third goal of the season on 76 minutes as he returns from injury, but Uruguayan Ruben Oliver leveled for Lecce just three minutes later. Napoli moved above Inter to third as Ezequiel Lavezz grabbed an injury time winner at Cagliari. Lazio were suffering their second straight defeat after going down to AS Roma in the capital city derby at the weekend. Marco Parolo scored the only goal of the game five minutes from time to sink Lazio. Turin giants Juventus are in fifth after a 1-1 draw at Brescia as Alessandro Diamanti equalized after Fabio Quagliarella's opener. In Spain's Copa Del Rey, Real Madrid thumped Real Murcia 5-1 at home to avoid the domestic cup upsets of recent seasons. The first leg had ended goalless. Esteban Granero's early goal put Real ahead before Gonzalo Higuain's controversial second, which saw Sergio Ramos clearly obstruct visiting goalkeeper Dani Hernandez from an offside position. Goals from Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Xabi Alonso settled the match in the Bernebeu in the second half. But Murcia scored a consolation through Pedro's late penalty. Barcelona are also safely through to the next round, thrashing AD Cueta 5-1 at Camp Nou. Already 2-0 up after the first leg, goals from Nolito and Gabriel Milito gave the hosts a two-goal lead inside the first 10 minutes, although the visitors pulled a goal back through Guzman after 35 minutes.

"Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has opened up about dealing with those who 'detest' him and his fractious relationship with David Cameron. As the Lib Dems today met in Glasgow for their autumn conference, Mr Clegg spoke of being misled by the Tories, Ukip's growing threat and his own parties sliding numbers, being ridiculed and calls for his resignation. But far from feeling defeated, Mr Clegg said it had only made him stronger. Nick Clegg applauds during the Lib Dems conference in Glagow today; the Deputy Prime Minister has spoken out about those who 'detest' him and how it has helped him develop a thicker skin . Mr Clegg described the beginning of his political career as being 'quite a baptism of fire' 'Of course there are people who detest me, on left and right, I wouldn't be doing my job if they didn't. But you are toughened up after four and a half years. I've got a thicker skin.' Mr Clegg told The Times. He said the beginning of his political career was, 'quite a baptism of fire' and he was being 'flayed alive' in the media everyday. 'I wouldn't wish those six months on my worst enemy. 'It was not pleasant but I'm much more comfortable in my skin now about what I'm doing and clear about what I want to do next. In the end, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.' For three years the Lib Dems have been resisting Tory attempts to freeze benefits, and now Mr Clegg says the Conservations are becoming merciless and 'wielding the axe'  at those who are living in poverty. His comments follow a speech by George Osborne, where he said the rich shouldn't have to pay any extra to reduce of the deficit. At the conference Mr Clegg, right, pledged an extra £1 billion in funding for the NHS . Mr Clegg, seen here meeting candidates, said he hoped to retain his party seats by securing the middle ground between the views held by George Osborne and Ed Miliband . He said the Tories need restraining, and if they get into government on their own the 'poor will get poorer' and there will be cuts to essential services like the police, social care and public services - because they won't use taxation. Mr Clegg said he felt let down by the Tories who had almost 'muted' almost out of recognition and now didn't stand for any of the things he thought united them as a coalition. They were in a 'blind panic' over Ukip, he said. The betrayal and division between the parties became very personal and public this week when Theresa May accused Mr Clegg of putting children's lives at risk by blocking the snooper's charter. While once the parties were allies, they were now political enemies. Mr Clegg and Mr Cameron were never best mates, he said. Mr Clegg rubbished David Cameron's efforts on the environment - a 'pale green spray-paint job' - and his proposal to seize the passports of returning jihadists, which 'is never going to happen'. Mr Clegg said he and David Cameron were never best mates, and he rubbished the Prime Minister's efforts on the environment and his proposal to seize the passports of returning jihadists . And he won't support the Prime Minister's plan to introduce English votes for English laws. Although the Lib Dems could lose half their seats at the next election, Mr Clegg believes he can hold on to them by seizing the middle ground that exists between Mr Osborne and Ed Miliband political positions. Today, at the Lib Dem conference, Mr Clegg pledged an extra £1 billion a year for the NHS and plans to pressure the chancellor to release more funds for the health service. Mr Clegg said the Lib Dems had been knocked-back a lot, but many of their ideas had been picked-up along the way. The Tories adopted his plan to raise the tax threshold to £12,500, and the mansion tax, although Mr Clegg has further refined the idea to include levies on the most expensive homes. Despite the souring of the coalition-coupling, Mr Clegg said they would remain together until May.","Nick Clegg has described his early days of politics like a 'baptism of fire'

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Rene Lecour's plan started out simple: Take his son on a skateboarding trip to someplace ""epic."" While he and his son, Kaya, were searching the internet, they saw videos of Cuba's skateboarders making do with beaten-up and jerry-rigged boards. Economic shortages and the U.S. embargo make it difficult to get most sporting equipment there. For skateboarders, it was nearly impossible. ""We both said right away, 'We are going there,' "" Lecour recalled. Lecour owns a chain of skateboard shops in South Florida and thought his contacts in the skating community would make it easy for him to bring boards to Cuba. He was wrong. ""I e-mailed every single skateboard company I know,"" Lecour said. ""The only two responses I got were unfortunately one person who said we shouldn't be allowed to go because of the embargo. Another 'genius' said we shouldn't come because all the skaters are all communist."" As a first-generation Cuban-American, Lecour had already been dreaming of visiting the island where his parents where born. The recent relaxing of travel restrictions under the Obama administration makes visiting easier for Cuban-Americans and for people on cultural exchange trips. But he didn't want to go empty-handed. A former DJ whose arms are crisscrossed with tattoos, Lecour put out the word that any board, no matter how worn or weathered, would be welcomed by the Cubans. Slowly, as he and his family got ready for the trip, skateboards began to trickle in. ""The response from the kids has been amazing,"" Lecour said. ""It's easier for a 9-year-old kid who skates to understand the need than for a 30-year-old head of a skateboard company, who just doesn't get it."" A week before the flight to Cuba, he held a skateboard party for people wishing to donate. Heavy metal rock played at a skate park in Miami's Kendall neighborhood in the background as dozens of teenagers practiced their moves. The boards continued to pile up in front of Lecour. ""This is really awesome,"" he said as the reality of the trip sank in. Cuban skaters like Che Alejandro Pando Napoles rely on generous foreigners like Lecour. Pando said there are skate parks around the island but no skate shops. There is nowhere for skaters to buy their first boards or replace ones that break, he said. ""Sometimes, it holds back your progression,"" Pando said. ""You see a set of stairs and you say, 'I am not going to do anything down there because I will break my board. I'd rather keep my board healthy than do that trick I really want do.' "" Pando lives for skating, a point he drives home by showing visitors his wedding video where, after the ceremony, he, his bride and wedding party roar away on skateboards. Before coming to Cuba, Lecour had been trying to get in touch with Pando, the closest thing to a leader in Havana's skate scene. Within an hour after landing, Lecour randomly bumped into Pando on the street in a kind of only-in-Havana coincidence. The two skaters quickly made plans to skate together and distribute the duffel bags full of boards and gear that Lecour brought with him. Walking into the skateboard area at Havana's Parque Metropolitano, Lecour immediately saw several dozen skaters and realized that he hadn't brought enough equipment to go around. Pando told him not to worry and said they would hold a skate competition. As the local skaters flew off ramps and attempted tricks, the Americans' eyes went wide. Lecour; his wife, Yirka; son, Kaya; and family friend Shane were stunned that the Cubans skated the way they did with the sorry gear they had. ""I don't how that guy uses such small wheels on that board,"" Lecour whispered. Soon, the contest was over. While most of the skaters didn't win boards, they seemed happy with the hats, T-shirts or sunglasses they received. The skaters who won boards wore ear-to-ear grins. Lecour says he doesn't want to be portrayed as ""the gringo coming to the rescue."" ""The Cuban skaters have been incredibly generous. They keep inviting us to meals and to get together,"" he said. ""I am already thinking of my next trip and all the gear I am going to bring.""","Rene Lecour is a first-generation Cuban-American and skateboard shop owner .

I don't want to lose what's me,' she explained. Speaking about her personal style, she said: 'I would say I'm edgy chic but effortlessly put together.

"A top Seattle lawyer has died after a truck crashed into her bike - leaving her partner to bring up their seven-month-old daughter alone. Sher Kung, 31, was riding in the bike lane along Second Avenue in the city on Friday morning when a truck made a left turn and struck her. She died at the scene. The tragic accident came less than two weeks before the city plans to improve safety for cyclists at the intersection, including adding a protected lane and a separate signal,King5 reported. The young lawyer, described by her firm Perkins Coie as 'one of our brightest young lawyers', had welcomed her first child, Bryn, with her fiancee Christine Sanders in February. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: 31-year-oldSher Kung, who welcomed a baby daughter with her partner earlier this year, was killed by a truck as she rode her bicycle in downtown Seattle last Friday .

She was 'an exceptional lawyer and a wonderful comrade, with boundless energy, legal brilliance and relentless optimism,' Perkins Coie said in a statement on Saturday, the Seattle Times reported. 'Our hearts go out to her partner and their child, her extended family, and her many friends.' Most famously, Kung was part of the American Civil Liberties Union trial team that successfully challenged the military's 'Don't Ask Don't Tell' policy. In September 2010, she helped the ACLU represent Air Force Major Margaret Witt, a nurse who was fired from the military in 2004 for being gay. The court ordered the military to give Witt her job back. Adored: She shared numerous photographs of her welcoming baby Bryn to the family earlier this year . Happy: Sanders, 37, has now been left to bring up the seven-month-old girl alone . Loved up: A photograph shared on Kung's Facebook at the start of last year shows her proposing . In photos of Witt and her partner Laurie McChesney celebrating after their victory outside court in Tacoma, a fresh-faced Kung can be seen grinning beside them. More recently, Kung worked on intellectual-property issues and educational materials that helped educate farmworkers about their rights, the Seattle Times reported. She had received her bachelor's degree from Brown University and her law degree from the University of California, Hastings College of Law. She met Sanders, 37, more than three years ago and the couple enjoyed an active lifestyle together. In a Facebook post last year, Kung was pictured on one knee proposing to Sanders. On January 1, Sanders shared an image of her large baby bump with the comment: 'Happy New Year, little bug! At 37 weeks you're officially term and we can't wait to meet you.

Tribute: A ghost bike memorial has been left at the intersection where Kung died in downtown Seattle . Loved: A note left on the memorial thanked the young lawyer for her dedicated work on LGBT issues . 'I'm not sure how we did it all, but in 2013, we got engaged, bought a house and made a person. In 2014, we solemnly swear we'll accomplish a little less.' On a fundraising page set up in her memory, friends wrote: 'Sher Kung was a beautiful, active and caring person that was loved by everyone who had the honor of knowing her. 'A life lived with heart, joy, passion, and such soaring love for her family and friends. Her cheery smile, positive attitude and warm, energetic personality will be missed by many.'

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 11:38 EST, 11 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:22 EST, 12 October 2012 . A man was beaten with a rounders bat for his bank card and laptop before being 'slowly tortured to death' with knives and broken bottles, dumped in a wheelie bin and set on fire, a court heard. 'Vulnerable' Jamie Dack, 22, was lured to a squat in Southampton and beaten by three men and a woman who stole his debit card and PIN number and used them to withdraw just £20 to fund a night out. The 'cold-blooded' gang - afraid their victim would go to the police - kept him in the flat overnight where they later tortured him to death over several hours using broken glass and kitchen knives, before setting his body alight in a prolonged and 'positively chilling' attack, Winchester Crown Court was told. 'Vicious': Jamie Dack, 22, was 'slowly tortured to death' at a flat in Southampton, a court was told . Mr Dack's body was found in a metal waste bin in on an industrial estate in Southampton on Easter Sunday. A post-mortem examination revealed he had been stabbed several times in the neck, shoulder, chest, stomach and leg, but his body was so badly burned the true extent of his injuries will never be known, the court heard. Donna Chalk, 21, Ryan Woodmansey, 32, Lee Nicholls, 28, and Andrew Dwyer-Skeats, 26, all deny murdering the 22-year-old on April 6. The jury at Winchester Crown Court was told the Southampton flat where the alleged murder took place was being used as a squat by Chalk and her boyfriend Dwyer-Skeats, who Mr Dack had got to know while living in the city. Investigation: Firefighters found Mr Dack's badly burned remains when they were called to put out a fire at the Southampton industrial estate . Prosecutor Christopher Parker QC said the defendants had targeted the 22-year-old's bank card and laptop after meeting up with him on Thursday April 5, to help fund a planned night out at a rave in Bournemouth. 'Mr Dack was beaten up in the bedroom with a rounders bat and his debit card was stolen from him and taken to a cash machine. Woodmansey got £20 from the machine,' Mr Parker said. 'Overnight, Mr Dack was kept in the flat and was never to leave it alive again.' 'On the Friday, he was left in the flat probably bound and gagged. These four defendants went out and sold his laptop. 'What happened next in cold blood is . they tortured him to death in the kitchen of the flat using fists and . feet, stabbing him with broken bottles and kitchen knives - altogether . as a group. 'Not everybody necessarily wielding . the bottle, not everybody necessarily wielding the knife, but those who . did not deliberately encouraged those who carried out the fatal . killing,' the barrister said. The next day the gang 'regrouped' and allegedly wheeled Mr Dack and a . blood-soaked carpet through the streets in wheelie bins before finding . the metal bin on an industrial estate, dousing his body in petrol and . setting it alight. It was done to 'systematically' try to hide what they had done, the prosecutor told the jury. Mr Dack knew the four and had been attacked by one of them the previous month over unfounded claims he had been a 'sex pest' to a girl, the court heard. Mr Parker went on: 'We say that each of these defendants, in each of his or her own way, was involved in that joint enterprise killing of Jamie. 'By their actions, or by their encouragement, they took part in a vicious and degrading attack on a young, vulnerable victim.' Firefighters found the badly burned remains when they were called to put out the fire in the early hours of April 8. Chalk also denies perverting the course of justice by disposing of the body and setting it alight. The jury was told that the three men have pleaded guilty to the charge of perverting the course of justice. The trial is expected to last seven weeks.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The defense attorney for one of two teenagers charged with fatally shooting a Georgia baby in the face spoke Wednesday about evidence in the case, saying speculation about the crime and evidence is complicating preparations for next month's trial. Public defender Kevin Gough, who represents De'Marquise ""Marky"" Elkins, said media reports have focused on ""evidence selectively disclosed by the police."" The investigation and prosecution have been ""heavy-handed,"" he said, and ""the state chooses to ignore obvious leads that are inconsistent with the state's theory of the case."" Gough said he issued his four-page statement because of an overwhelming number of media inquiries, and he said it would be his last before the trial in three weeks. Elkins and another teenager, Dominique Lang, have been charged with murder in the March 21 killing of 13-month-old Antonio Santiago. They were 17 and 14 at the time, respectively. The case has drawn national attention for the horrific nature of the child's death. The child's mother, Sherry West, has said two teenagers approached her in the street in broad daylight. One pointed a gun at her and told her that if she didn't give him her money he would shoot her and shoot her baby. West said that the teen fired at her, hitting her in one leg and barely missing her head. The teen then shot her child in the face, she said. Baby's death marks 2nd time Georgia mom loses a son to violence . Gough said the case against his client is best described as circumstantial. ""Contrary to speculation by some, there is no evidence of gunshot residue on Marky Elkins or upon his clothing. There is no murder weapon. There is no confession,"" he said in his statement. He said defense theories are evolving as the evidence develops, and he predicted further developments in the coming weeks. ""Much of what has been said about Mr. Elkins has been unkind, and much of that discussion has been based on false assumptions and misinformation,"" he said. Asked about Gough's statement on the gunshot residue, Mark Spaulding, a spokesman for the Glynn County district attorney's office, said, ""We don't have a comment on the record."" Elkins' mother, aunt and sister have also been arrested on various charges alleging that they have hindered the investigation. The sister, Sabrina Elkins, was named in a grand jury indictment accusing her of helping her mother get rid of the gun authorities say was used to kill the child. Police found that gun in a pond more than two miles from where the shooting happened. Gough said more witnesses should not be afraid to come forward. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","Kevin Gough represents teenage suspect De'Marquise Elkins .

"(CNN)  -- John Isner has defeated Nicolas Mahut 70 games to 68 in the final set of their first round marathon match at Wimbledon. After 11 hours and five minutes, spread over three days, the 6-foot-9 American finally broke his French opponent's serve in the 138th game of the fifth set, putting an end to one of the most extraordinary matches of tennis ever played. The final score read 6-4 3-6 6-7 7-6 70-68. Interviewed after the match, Isner had warm praise for Mahut. ""What can I say, The guy is an absolute warrior. To share this day with him was an absolute honor. I wish him nothing but the best. Maybe we'll meet again somewhere down the road and it won't be 70-68,"" Isner told the BBC. Mahut described the last three days as an amazing experience. ""The Crowd was fantastic, John deserved to win,"" he told the BBC. Immediately after the match ended, officials from the All England Club presented both players with momentos for their record-breaking feat. The players then posed for a photograph by the scoreboard, alongside match umpire Mohamed Lahyani. A huge crowd greeted the players as they returned to Court 18 a little after 2.30pm GMT, Thursday, with spectators and press lining the walkways above the court. Isner, serving first, took the opening game of the day, but Mahut followed up by holding his serve to level the match 60 games all. The match quickly resumed the pattern established on Wednesday with each player rarely looking in trouble on their own serve. The pair battled on for a further 20 games before Isner, who served a record breaking 115 aces during the match, triumphed. The pair had already made history on Wednesday contesting the longest grand slam singles match of all time. It was called off for the day due to bad light at 59 games all in the fifth and deciding set after 10 hours of action. During their marathon fifth set, the pair surpassed the previous record of six hours and 33 minutes set at the 2004 French Open, when Fabrice Santoro beat fellow Frenchman Arnaud Clement 6-4 6-3 6-7 3-6 16-14. Isner had match point at 59-58, but Mahut saved it with an ace and went on to level again. The match had also been stopped on Tuesday night due to bad light. ""This is beyond anything I've ever seen. It's absolutely amazing,"" Defending champion Roger Federer told reporters, Wednesday. ""I have almost no words anymore watching this. I don't know how their bodies must be feeling. This is incredible tennis. Someone has to lose, but in this match both will be winners,"" Federer added.","John Isner beats Nicolas Mahut 70 games to 68 in final set of first round Wimbledon match .

"Wife number four: George Galloway outside his London home with new wife Putri Gayatri Pertiwi . Politician George Galloway married for the fourth time yesterday - but it was not long before the father of his third wife accused the MP of being a 'bigamist'. The 58-year-old tied the knot with Dutch-born consultant Putri Gayatri Pertiwi - who is 31 years his junior - in a civil ceremony at the Houses of Parliament on Saturday. But the father of Mr Galloway's third wife, Rima, declared he was in fact still married to his daughter. 'Rima is still legally his wife according to Muslim law, which British law does not accept. He has committed bigamy,' Haschem Husseini told The Sun. A spokesman for Mr Galloway confirmed the couple married yesterday and vehemently denied the MP had committed bigamy. When asked about the accusation that the Bradford West MP is still married, his spokesman replied: 'Are you suggesting he is a bigamist? I having nothing more to say, whatsoever.' The Respect leader's first marriage was to his childhood sweetheart Elaine, in 1979. The couple were married until 1987 and had two children together. He next tied the knot to Palestinian Dr Amineh Abu-Zayyad in 1994 in a Muslim ceremony, and in 2007 he married Lebanese-born Rima. They have a four-year-old son Zain, and a second son, Faris, who was born at the beginning of this year. In April, Rima launched a bitter verbal assault when it was announced that Mr Galloway had gone through a ceremony with Putri, 27, in Amsterdam. At that time, the Lebanese . researcher said: ‘We are still married under Islamic law. There is a . misconception you can have up to four wives in Islam – but it’s just not . true in the 21st Century. ‘It may have been the case hundreds . of years ago as a way of looking after women in the villages who had . lost their husbands, but it doesn’t exist now. ‘It’s just a stupid, man-made thing in some Arab countries. It’s not true. Under Islamic law we remain married.’ The new Mr and Mrs Galloway will continue to live in the £1.4million home they share in Streatham, South . London.

"By . John Hall . A street artist has filed a cease and desist letter to Apple accusing the company of not seeking permission to use a slogan he claims to own, it has been claimed. James De La Vega, 46, is said to have filed the claim in reaction to Apple's usage of the phrase 'You're more powerful than you think' in its latest high-profile advertising campaign for the iPhone 5S. The New York-based artist is known for writing motivational messages as part of his decade-long 'Become Your Dream' graffiti series, and allegedly claims the phrase Apple is using is so closely associated with his work that other companies have previously approached him to use it. Scroll down for video . Inspiring: New York-based street artist James De La Vega (pictured) is known for writing motivational messages as part of his decade-long 'Become Your Dream' graffiti series . Dispute: James De La Vega is said to have sent a cease and desist letter to technology giant Apple. He apparently claims to have trademarked the phrase 'You're more powerful than you think' De La Vega's inspirational slogans adorn not just walls and streets in New York, but have also previously been used in a range of commercial handbags and fashion accessories. Now he claims that Apple has deliberately adopted one of them without seeking his permission in order to motivate potential customers into buying its products, according to Barbara Ross writing in the New York Daily News. The newspaper quotes the letter De La Vega's lawyer Richard Garbarini allegedly sent to Apple as saying the company has violated the artist's rights as the 'common law owner of the trademark'. Apple's usage of the slogan 'clearly misleads customers into believing De La Vega somehow supports, approves and/or endorses its products' it apparently adds. Well-known: James De La Vega is famous for his street murals and chalk drawings, which can mainly be found in and around the East Harlem area of Upper Manhattan . Motivational: The phrase 'You're more powerful than you think' is used prominently in Apple's latest high-profile advertising campaign for the iPhone 5S (pictured) The letter is said to conclude that De La Vega is hoping to negotiate for a settlement for using the phrase as he wants to avoid filing a lawsuit. De La Vega is famous for his street murals and chalk drawings, which can mainly be found in and around the East Harlem area of Upper Manhattan. He is a graduate of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York state, and a former art teacher at York Preparatory School. A recipient of a Joan Mitchell Foundation Painters & Sculptors Grant in 1999, De La Vega has had some of his work featured at Christie's auction house - although most of his art has been sold through his own East Village gallery, which closed in 2010.

"(CNN) -- A group of heavily armed men opened fire at a soccer match between two local teams in western Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, killing seven people and wounding two others, according to a municipal police spokesman. The soccer field is at a community center opened four months ago as part of a program to decrease drug violence in a city that has been racked by violence and killings linked to drug cartels. Police said Monday they had not determined a motive for the shooting. The dead from the shooting Sunday evening were males ranging in age from 19 to 26, police said. At least one was a soccer player -- an image from the scene showed the dead player face down on turf. Above him was a posted sign reading in Spanish, ""Live Better"" -- a slogan in Juarez's anti-violence campaign. Three victims died at the scene, while four others died on the way to area hospitals. The gunmen -- reportedly traveling in three vehicles -- sprayed the soccer field with about 180 rounds from assault rifles around 6 p.m., just before the game got started, police said. Among the dead and wounded were several fans. Some of the victims were taken to hospitals by family members. One of the injured was a 12-year-old shot in the foot, the newspaper El Diario de Juarez said. ""We still do not have a motive why they opened fire,"" municipal police spokesman Adrian Sanchez told CNN in a phone interview from the scene. ""They fired 180 rounds in three or four seconds. It happened fast,"" Sanchez added. ""People here are still confused about what happened.""

"By . David Charlesworth, Press Association . Hull boss Steve Bruce believes any side he chooses to field against Lokeren will be capable of overturning a 1-0 deficit in their Europa League play-off second leg - but has urged his players to show patience. Bruce made wholesale changes for the opening encounter against the Belgian team last week but an uncharacteristic error from goalkeeper Allan McGregor led to the Tigers facing an uphill task on Thursday evening. Despite the setback at the Daknamstadion, Bruce is once again prepared to shuffle his pack as he contemplates having to juggle a squad on both domestic and European fronts this season. Hoping: Steve Bruce believes Hull can overturn a 1-0 deficit against Lokeren in their Europa League play-off . That dilemma will only occur if his side can come from behind and defeat Lokeren to reach the group stages of the competition, although Bruce is supremely confident. 'We've got a squad of depth which I'm very, very comfortable with. We made wholesale changes last week, I don't think it's going to be as many this week but we'll certainly make a few,' Bruce said. 'It's quite simple, we've got to win the match and we're capable of that, no matter what line-up I pick, we're capable of winning the game. 'We know that we'd love to be in the next stages; to get in the group stages would be terrific for the club, we're aware of that. We're also aware of how difficult it is with all the pitfalls that come with it. 'We'll be going all out to try and get a result and get us through to the league situation which we'd all look forward to.' Settling in: New boy Michael Dawson trains with former Spurs duo Tom Huddlestone and Jake Livermore . Working hard: Following the arrival of Dawson, Bruce is very pleased with the squads depth at Hull this term . Bruce, however, is wary of his side taking Lokeren lightly and has warned them not to throw caution to the wind, as they did in the third qualifying round, when they had to come from a goal down against AS Trencin to progress. 'The one thing you can't be is gung ho,' Bruce said. 'They're good opposition, they've got some good players; you don't finish fifth in the Belgian league and win the (domestic) cup if you're not a good side. 'So of course you've got to have a bit of patience, you've got to have a bit of guile about you and if we leave ourselves exposed at the back then like we did against Trencin we'll concede after a minute.' However, Bruce was keen to add that they must dictate the tempo of the contest. 'It's vitally important that we play at a level which we're comfortable with and the one thing about the Premier League to other leagues is the pace, the tempo, the quickness to it is the main difference,' he said. Done deal: Dawson becsmr Hull City's sixth summer signing as Steve Bruce tries to deepen his squad . 'So we've got play at our pace to make sure that we are on the front foot against them.' Hull received a boost ahead of the clash on Tuesday night with the signing of Michael Dawson from Tottenham although the defender will be ineligible to make his bow against Lokeren. Bruce, though, believes the 30-year-old's experience whilst he was with Spurs will prove invaluable during the season as Hull once again attempt to remain in the Premier League. 'He's a quality player who's played at the highest level in the Premier League for the last seven or eight years,' Bruce added. 'All of the ingredients in what he brings to the table was the reason why we brought him here. 'It's going to be difficult in the second season. 'So the additions of people like himself can only help the cause. We're trying to move the thing forward and trying to get a bigger and better squad because it's a long season ahead with many games to play and when a quality addition like him becomes available we're delighted to get him.'","Steve Bruce confident Hull can overcome Lokeren in Europa League play-off .

"(RollingStone.com) -- When the Flaming Lips took the stage toward the end of the annual Tibet House benefit show at Carnegie Hall last night, there were none of the mirror balls or laser beams that typically end a Lips show -- but the band had a different surprise in store. After a stunning take on rarely played ""Soft Bulletin"" track ""Feeling You Disintegrate,"" frontman Wayne Coyne invited composer Philip Glass to the stage's grand piano. ""We've been rehearsing with him all day,"" Coyne said. ""And he's pretty f--ing cool."" The band kicked into a slow, hushed version of their classic ""Do You Realize?"", Coyne strumming his acoustic guitar, the body of which was connected to a green bubble. Late in the song, Glass took over with a spiraling piano line that vaguely hinted at the Lips' melody while guitarist Steven Drozd slowly added chilling touches of reverb. Coyne looked visibly moved and stopped playing entirely, closed his eyes and raised his fist, grinning. Rolling Stone: Exclusive performance: The Flaming Lips rehearse trippy version of 'Do You Realize?' ""Playing with him is how playing with Syd Barrett must have been,"" Coyne said after the performance, ""Changing something just as you're catching on. And that's exactly what you want."" This year marked the 61st anniversary of the 1950 Chinese invasion of Tibet, and the benefit -- which also featured Patti Smith, Michael Stipe, Taj Mahal and the Roots -- is in its 21st year. The show kicked off with several Tibetan monks in robes chanting in front of a large painting of the region's sprawling Potala Palace. The Roots were the first performers to bring the entire audience to their feet when they were joined by Angelique Kidjo for a rousing ""Move on Up."" Their peak was their take on Neil Young's ""Down by the River,"" a reprise from their Carnegie appearance last month at a Young tribute show. Guitarist Captain Kirk Douglas took center stage, wailing on his Gibson SG and throwing in riffs of ""Hey Joe"" under Young's lyrics. R.E.M. aren't touring off ""Collapse into Now"" (out March 8th), but Michael Stipe looked thrilled to be onstage. He debuted two never-performed R.E.M. songs: ""Saturn Return,"" off 2008's ""Reveal,"" which he performed standing behind the piano, and gorgeous new ""Collapse"" track ""Everyday is Yours to Win."" He told the crowd he had only played the song in bassist Mike Mills' living room in L.A. two weeks earlier, but it sounded like an R.E.M. classic. Rolling Stone: Michael Stipe discusses making ""Collapse into Now"" at rehearsal for Tibet House Benefit Concert . Last year, Iggy Pop made a scene stage diving into the relatively stiff Carnegie crowd as Smith watched from the side of the stage. This year, she gave the most aggressive performance, beginning with the Youngbloods' ""Get Together,"" which sounded like more of a plea than ever, and then kicked into an apocalyptic take on Buddy Holly's ""Not Fade Away."" Her band grooved on the raucous Bo Diddley beat while Smith gave an impassioned speech that proved she's been glued to the news lately. ""In Cairo and Wisconsin.... the people are taking to the streets, taking the power!"" she yelled. She also cited recent mysterious incidents -- thousands of blackbirds falling from the sky and dead fish washing up in Arkansas -- saying, ""Mother Nature is calling with such anguish. We must find a way to show love, because if you don't show love for Mother Nature, she will fucking take you down!"" Rolling Stone: Video: Watch Iggy Pop's final stage dive at Carnegie Hall . At the after party at New York's Gotham Hall, Coyne clutched he scarves he wore during his performance. He was still beaming from playing with Glass. ""There's a vulnerability to the song, and I think he knew that,"" Coyne said. ""That vulnerability makes all the difference. That makes it believable and makes it seem like anything can happen.""

"A driver who was trying to hide her identity from cops said that she was 22 and only looked older because she had a medical condition that made her age faster, according to a police report. Jennifer Crosby, 43, was driving through Indian River County, Florida on a suspended license when she was pulled over by a police officer for broken tail lights. When she was asked to hand over her license and other documents, she told the officer she had forgotten her purse, according to the police report shared by The Smoking Gun. She then claimed her name was Christina Topp and that she had been born on March 16, 1992. Arrest: Jennifer Crosby, 43, (pictured left in her mug shot and right with her daughter) pretended to be the 22-year-old woman when she was pulled over while driving on a suspended license, police said . But the officer, Deputy Colby Smith, wrote in the report: 'Immediately I was suspicious because the driver appeared significantly older than that.' She even gave a social security number that matched with the identity - but when the officer checked a database that showed a photo of Topp, it was clear the two women were not the same person. In fact, the woman she had claimed to be was her daughter. 'She admitted that her name was Jennifer R. Crosby and she gave me her daughter’s name because her driver's license was suspended,' the report noted. She was arrested for driving on a suspended license and providing a false name and booked into the county jail, where she remains on bond of $4,000. 'Lies': Crosby, pictured, claimed that she had a condition that made her appear older than she actually was - but police weren't buying it. She remains in jail after being arrested for providing a false name . The arrest comes just months after she was arrested for possession of crack cocaine, which she had hidden inside her vagina in a piece of foil. When cops conducting a search asked her if she had any drugs on her person, she admitted that she had cocaine inside of her. But when she pulled them out, she screamed in pain and said: 'The foil is hurting the inside of my vagina', according to a police report.","Jennifer Crosby 'was driving on a suspended license when she was pulled over for broken tail lights - and pretended to be her 22-year-old daughter'

They were sights to be reckoned with. And now Somerset House is set to celebrate the muse and stylist with an exhibition displaying 100 pieces from her wardrobe. Isabella Blow: Fashion Galore! will highlight her aristocratic . background, growing up at the family seat in Cheshire, her championing . of Treacy and McQueen, and her love of the British countryside.

She built up a significant personal collection . of their work, as well as that of Hussein Chalayan and Julien Macdonald, . among others. Bespoke mannequins dressed in full outfits worn by Blow will demonstrate her unique style. Designers whose pieces will be on show in the exhibition include Alexander McQueen, Fendi, Philip Treacy, Dior, Prada, Viktor and Rolf, Manolo Blahnik and Marni. Blow started her 30 year career auspiciously as an assistant to Anna Wintour at US Vogue. Even then, she steered clear of the conventional. At Blow's memorial service, Wintour said that when Blow worked for Vogue she did everything fabulously, even cleaning Wintour's desk with Perrier water and Chanel perfume.

She discovered models Sophie Dahl and Stella Tenant, and worked with major photographers like Steven Meisel and David LaChapelle. She revelled in shocking people with daring outfits: she once wore a fish-smelling, crystal-encrusted lobster on her head to a fashion show. For her wedding, she wore a deep purple medieval robe that she matched with a gold mesh, helmet-esque headpiece. But she began to suffer from depression, and in 2007, diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ovarian cancer, Blow committed suicide aged 48. Isabella Blow with Horns, .

The artist and heiress, who bought Blow's wardrobe in its entirety in 2010, added: 'Isabella Blow made our world more vivid, trailing colour with every pace she took. It is a sorrier place for her absence. 'When I visited her beloved clothes in a storage room in South Kensington, it seemed quite clear the collection would be of immense value to a great many people. 'I do believe that in choosing to exhibit them we've done the right thing - and that it is what she would have wanted. I am doing this in memory of a dear friend, in the hope that her legacy may continue to aid and inspire generations of designers to come.' Guinness is the founder of the Isabella Blow Foundation, which promotes fashion, encourages young talent, and supports charities promoting mental health. In partnership with Central Saint Martins, the Isabella Blow Foundation collaborated with Somerset House to present Blow’s collection.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The commander for NATO forces in Afghanistan said Wednesday that more military presence is ""needed as quickly as possible."" U.S. troops are seeing an increased threat in Afghanistan, Gen. David McKiernan says. Gen. David McKiernan said the additional military capability is needed because of ""an increased number of fighters"" coming into Afghanistan from Pakistan's lawless tribal regions. ""It's a significant increase from what we saw this time last year,"" he said at the Pentagon. ""We're facing a tougher threat right now, especially in the east where we have the U.S. division,"" he said. ""And so the additional military capability [is] needed as quickly as possible."" He said what's necessary includes ""boots on the ground"" as well as support such as ""helicopters, increased intelligence assets, logistics, transportation and so on."" Just over a week ago, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said that a Marine battalion will head to Afghanistan in November and an Army brigade in January, but no more forces will be available for deployment to Afghanistan until spring or summer of 2009. The week before Gates' announcement, McKiernan had asked for four more brigades -- three more than the one approved to go in January. Three brigades add up to as many as 12,000 troops. The defense secretary, speaking before the Senate Armed Services Committee last month, expressed caution about adding too many troops in Afghanistan. ""I think we need to think about how heavy a military footprint the U.S. ought to have in Afghanistan,"" he told the committee. Instead, Gates said, there should be a focus on increasing the size of the Afghan army. McKiernan, who took command of NATO's International Security Assistance Force earlier this year, said his request of an additional 3,500 people to train the Afghan army and police is still under review. McKiernan noted that he is ""cautiously optimistic"" regarding Pakistan's military operations against Taliban and al Qaeda fighters inside its borders. ""What we're seeing is Pakistani leadership taking on a deteriorated militant sanctuary in the tribal areas that has deteriorated over last several years,"" he said. McKiernan said it is ""probably too early"" to see if Pakistan's military clampdown in its tribal areas has had any effect on stemming militant activity in Afghanistan. ""We're watching those very closely to see if there's a cause and effect with the strength of the insurgency on the Afghan side of the border,"" he said. ""But we think that's a positive step that they are taking on those militant sanctuaries.""","More foreign fighters entering Afghanistan from Pakistan, general says .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Controversy: David Cameron characterised Britain as a 'Christian country' in a recent article . David Cameron's controversial claim that Britain is a 'Christian country' risks sowing 'alienation and division' in society, a group of leading public figures has warned. More than 50 writers, scientists, broadcasters and academics have signed an open letter expressing concern at the 'negative consequences' of the Prime Minister's assertion in a country where most people do not describe themselves as Christian. Signatories of the letter, published in The Daily Telegraph, include the authors Philip Pullman and Sir Terry Pratchett; broadcasters Dan Snow and Nick Ross, the philosopher AC Grayling; and the human rights activist Peter Tatchell. It follows the article last week for the Church Times by Mr Cameron - who in the past has been reluctant to discuss religious matters - in which he wrote of his own faith and his desire to infuse politics with Christian ideals and values. While the letter acknowledges that the Prime Minister is entitled to his religious beliefs, his comments do not reflect the country as it is today. 'We wish to object to his repeated mischaracterising of our country as a ""Christian country"" and the negative consequences for our politics and society that this view engenders,' the letter states. 'Repeated surveys, polls, and studies show most of us as individuals are not Christian in our beliefs or our religious identities and at a social level, Britain has been shaped for the better by many pre-Christian, non-Christian, and post-Christian forces. 'We are a plural society with citizens with a range of perspectives and a largely non-religious society. To constantly claim otherwise fosters alienation and division in our society.' The letter said that Mr Cameron was wrong to 'exceptionalise' the contributions made to society by Christians when they are equalled by those of people with different beliefs. Author Philip Pullman is one of 50 signatories of the letter - which has been published in The Daily Telegraph . 'It needlessly fuels enervating sectarian debates that are by and large absent from the lives of most British people, who - as polls show - do not want religions or religious identities to be actively prioritised by their elected government.' Professor Jim Al-Khalili, the theoretical physicist and science broadcaster and President of the British Humanist Association, who organised the letter said Mr Cameron's comments were part of a 'disturbing trend'. 'Politicians have been speaking of our country as ""a Christian country"" with increasing frequency in the last few years,"" he said. 'Not only is this inaccurate, I think it's a wrong thing to do in a time when we need to be building a strong shared identity in an increasingly plural and non-religious society.'","50 liberals signed open letter over concerns about Cameron's assertion .

"Slimy: An enormous infestation of millipedes could have caused a crash between two trains in Western Australia. This is a file picture of a black Portuguese millipede . An enormous infestation of millipedes could have caused a crash between  two trains in Western Australia. The crash happened when a train arriving into a station at Clarkson, 25 miles . north of Perth, slammed into a stationary one. It resulted in six passengers being treated for stiff . necks following the crash on Tuesday. But it has since emerged that the crash could have happened after hundreds of Black Portuguese millipedes were found squashed in a slippery mess on the track. 'Millipedes are one of the factors we are going to take into account,' David Hynes, spokesman at the Public Transport Authority of Western Australia, said. 'What happened in previous instances is trains which were travelling at speed have gone over an infestation, crushed them and made the tracks slimy. 'The train loses traction and the train has slipped.' Hynes said. The millipedes are attracted to moist environments and are seen as invasive pests at high population levels. In 2009, thousands of them overran 1.2 miles of track, causing train delays and cancellations near Melbourne in southeast Australia. The black Portuguese millipede is native to Portugal and was accidentally introduced into Australia where it has since become an invasive pest. The millipede has flourished in Australia because of a lack of natural predators. They are most often seen in moist conditions, which creates lots of food. They have also been  known to enter homes. Huge numbers of millipedes were crushed crossing the railway tracks at Tallarook, central Victoria in March 2009, causing train cancellations due to the disturbance of signalling equipment.","A train arriving into a station near Perth crashed into stationary one .

"(CNN) -- Some folks in Texas think it would be a good idea if they tore down what has been called the ""Eighth Wonder of the World"" and replaced it with a park. The Astrodome, which opened in April 1965 as an engineering marvel, hasn't had a tenant since 2003 when the Houston Rodeo moved to a new stadium next door. (The Astros scooted away after the 1999 season). Last year, Houston residents said they weren't going to spring for a property tax increase that would have helped pay to turn the now-dilapidated dome into a spiffy, green convention center. 25 years on the 'dead stadium' tour . So Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo and the Houston Texans, who also play at NRG Stadium, asked two firms to come up with some potential uses of the land. One is a $66 million greenspace that, if they got started soon, could be ready in time for the 2017 Super Bowl. The site would feature columns on which great moments or players or entertainers would be remembered. ""Although the option does include removal of the NRG Astrodome building itself, it pays homage to the history, heritage and culture of the Dome,"" the rodeo said on its website. ""The plan is constructed so that anyone who visits the space will have the ability to learn about the relevant events held in the Dome and about its unique history."" Wrigley Field 100 years later . Joe Stinebaker, a spokesperson for Harris County Judge Ed Emmett, said this doesn't mean the Astrodome is coming down any time soon. ""Anybody and their brother can make a proposal,"" Stinebaker said. ""This is not a county proposal. This is coming from tenant NRG Park. The county does not have a proposal pending nor is there a timetable."" On Twitter, he said that only the commissioners will decide the fate of the first domed sports stadium in the world.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . It is one of the few certainties of air travel. You can normally assume that – after all the ticket checks and security procedures – if you are allowed onto an aircraft, it is the plane that will be taking you to your destination. 'Traumatised': Stacey McGuinness found herself at the wrong airport . But this was not the case for a Scottish holidaymaker who found herself 300 miles from home last week after low-cost carrier Jet2 dropped her in the wrong country. This mistake led to red faces at the airline – and a long taxi ride for the weary tourist. Stacey McGuinness, 27, from Dundee, had just enjoyed a ten-day break in Turkey with her family. She was due to fly home from Dalaman, in the south-west of Turkey, on Friday – and was booked onto the 11.05pm Jet2 flight to Glasgow. Three hours later, she found herself not just at the wrong airport, but in the wrong country, after the plane landed at Leeds-Bradford Airport. The confusion began at Dalaman Airport. ‘The screen said to go to gate 33 for the flight to Glasgow,’ Ms McGuinness says. ‘But when I went to the desk it said Leeds-Bradford.’ ‘When I asked at the desk, they said “this is the right one”. ‘I asked them to check again just before we boarded, but they still said I was in the right place. ‘I got to my seat fine. The plane was quite empty anyway.’ Despite the assurances that she was on the right flight, Stacey's nightmare situation was confirmed when the captain told the passengers they were just one hour from touching down in England. Forced to apologise: Budget airline Jet2 put Stacey McGuinness onto the wrong flight at Dalaman Airport . When the plane landed, Stacey met a Jet2 manager, who apologised for the mistake. Her luggage was nowhere to be seen. The airline decided to call for a taxi to take her on a five-hour journey back to Dundee. But Stacey said the gesture was not enough. She still hasn't received her baggage, and she wants compensation for her whole ordeal. ‘The manager said it shouldn't have happened, and that I could have been a terrorist or anything’ she says. ‘He ordered me a taxi all the way back to Dundee, and the taxi driver did not want the journey at all. ‘I got back in the end, but all my clothes and valuables are in my suitcase that I still haven't got back, and the customer services are telling me nothing.' Jet2 have been unable to comment on the issue of how she ended up on the wrong flight. Not even close: The holidaymaker wanted to go to Glasgow, but found herself at Leeds-Bradford Airport . However, they have said that Ms McGuinness's luggage will be returned to her today. A spokeswoman for Jet2 said: ‘Ms McGuinness's baggage has arrived with us and will be delivered today. Jet2 apologises for the inconvenience.’ Stacey, who lives in Douglas, a suburb of Dundee, says: ‘I asked twice if I was in the right place, and each time they said that I was. ‘I still can't believe what has happened. 'I won't be travelling with Jet2 again. I'm scared to even fly at all now. ‘I was on my own, which made it worse. I was really traumatised.’","Stacey McGuinness wanted to fly to Glasgow, but landed at Leeds-Bradford .

A new suspect is set to be charged with murder over the killing of PC Keith Blakelock in the 1985 Broadwater Farm riots, it was reported today. Scotland Yard is poised to prosecute the man, who was under 18 at the time, in what has become one of Britain's most notorious unsolved murder cases. Sources told The Sunday Telegraph that after reviewing the evidence against the man, two QCs agreed there was a realistic prospect of conviction. PC Keith Blakelock, murdered during the Broadwater Farm riots in Tottenham, north London, in 1985 . Officially, Scotland Yard insisted last night that no final decision had been made and that detectives were not yet ready to bring charges. A spokesman said: 'The reinvestigation into the murder of PC Blakelock is ongoing. 'Regular consultation with the CPS has been taking place in relation to this case as is usual in all such investigations. 'We have not reached a decision regarding any charges against any individual.' The newspaper reported that sources believed the suspect was set to be charged within weeks. Detectives' confidence was said to have been buoyed by the conviction in January of Gary Dobson and David Norris for the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence. Police on the Broadwater Farm estate in north London, during the riots in which Pc Keith Blakelock was hacked to death . In 2005 detectives released this image of the uniform worn by PC Blakelock on the night he was murdered. The yellow tape shows where the knife strikes hit him . Aftermath: Substantial damage was caused. Here, the day after PC Blakelock was killed, police officers inspect the damge walking past burnt out houses and cars . The officers believe that if such a long-standing and legally complex case can be resolved then justice can also finally be secured for PC Blakelock. PC Blakelock, 40, was attacked as he tried to protect firefighters who were tackling a supermarket blaze at the height of the riot on October 6, 1985. After stumbling, the father of three was surrounded by a mob screaming: 'Kill the pig'. PC Keith Blakelock (left) was killed by machete during riots on the Broadwater Farm estate. Winston Silcott (right) was one of three men wrongly convicted of the murder in 1987 . Police hide behind riot shields as they come under fire from a mob during the 1985 riots . He was stabbed dozens of times and the machete-wielding killers then tried to decapitate him. A later trial heard the mob intended to parade the constable's head on a pole to taunt other officers. Winston Silcott, Mark Braithwaite and Engin Raghip were convicted in March 1987 of PC Blakelock's murder but all three convictions were quashed four and a half years later, after forensic tests on pages of key interview records suggested they had been fabricated. Silcott accepted £50,000 compensation from the Home Office but remained in prison for an unrelated murder and was released in 2003. None of the three men originally convicted is the suspect in the new case. In 2003, Scotland Yard reopened the murder investigation after a review indicated there were possible new lines of inquiry. It was revealed on the 25th anniversary of his murder, in October 2010, that 10 men had been arrested in London and Suffolk for questioning over the crime. All were aged in their 40s or 50s and had lived in the Tottenham area at the time of the riot. New forensic tests were carried out on PC Blakelock's flame-retardant overalls, which for years had been on show to criminologists and trainee police officers at Scotland Yard's 'Black Museum'. The garment and more than a dozen murder weapons - several machetes and a kitchen knife found embedded up to the hilt in the constable's neck - were analysed using updated DNA techniques for the first time. Evidence gathered by the new inquiry is also believed to include significant new witness statements.","Sources say two QCs agreed there was a .

"Afghan President Hamid Karzai says he has received assurances from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency's station chief in Kabul that it will continue delivering cash, as it has for the past decade, to his offices. ""Yes, we received cash from the CIA for the past 10 years. It was very useful, and we are very thankful for this aid,"" the president said during a news conference Saturday in Kabul. ""Yesterday, I thanked the CIA's chief in Kabul and I requested their continued help, and they promised that they will continue. "" Karzai's comments follow last week's report by The New York Times that the CIA has been dropping off shopping bags full of money every month or so for more than a decade to the offices of the Afghan president. ""This is not unusual,"" he told reporters, adding that the money was spent by his office and the national security office for a variety of purposes, including paying salaries, helping the war wounded and providing scholarships. Karzai dismissed questions about why such money, not in state coffers, was needed for what he described as government expenses. ""This is the choice of the American government,"" he said. Karzai's statements on Saturday appeared to be meant to mollify a growing outcry over the revelation of the CIA payments, which has raised questions about whether the money undercut efforts to quell corruption in Afghanistan. The United States has previously criticized what officials have described as rampant corruption within the Afghan government. Nearly three years ago, reports surfaced that the CIA was making payments to a number of Karzai's family members, even as his key adviser and a number of ministers were being investigated for corruption. In the latest allegation of CIA payments in Afghanistan, the New York Times, which cited unnamed U.S., European and Afghan officials, reported that the cash payments ranged from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. It said the payments were used from everything from payoffs for lawmakers and warlord to paying for ""informal negotiations."" The report did not say how much money had been provided to Karzai's office. As a matter of routine, the CIA does not comment on its operations. The agency did not return a call from CNN seeking comment. Karzai also disputed claims that his office received cash from MI6, the British intelligence agency. He acknowledged MI6 gave money to other organizations in Afghanistan, but he did not identify them.","President Hamid Karzai said he met with the CIA station chief in Kabul .

'One person, a fishermen from South Korea, died from hypothermia,' said Artur Rets, chief of the Naval Coordination and Rescue Centre in Petropavlosvsk-Kamchatsky, where the temperature is currently -4°C. 'The destiny of 54 other crew members is as yet unknown.' 'The ship tilted slowly after taking in water, forcing crew members to abandon it,' said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries. 'Several vessels from nearby waters were involved in search and rescue efforts, but the operation has been hampered by bad weather.' Other accounts said 52 were missing. A fishing trawler sank off the Chukotka peninsula after being hit by a large wave in bad weather (file picture) 'Seven people were rescued, including a Russian inspector,' said Rets. 'Five were taken on board the Russian 'Karolina-7' fishing trawler, two others to the 'Zaliv Zabiyaka' boat'.' He said that a huge search was underway as night fell. 'The crew of all boats in the area are carrying intense searches right now, looking for 54 others in the water,' he said. However, the weather conditions were difficult. 'The wind is 25-27 m/c, with waves reaching 5-6 metres. 'We received information about the incident at about 5 pm local time, when the emergency buoy of 'Oryong-501' went off. The trawler sank very quickly.' Reports said the crew comprised 11 South Koreans, 13 from the Philippines, 35 from Indonesia, plus one Russian inspector. Other versions said there were 62 on board when it went down in mid-afternoon on Monday. The vessel was operated by South Korea's Sajo Industries. The human body cools 25 times faster in cold water than it does in air. The expected time of survival of a person in 41-degree F (5°C) water is up to three hours.","South Korean trawler has sunk leaving more than 50 men missing .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds filed by a casket on Sunday to say goodbye to a small-town hero who died shortly after scoring the winning shot to clinch an undefeated season for his Michigan high school basketball team. Friends, family and even competitors braved a cold Michigan day for a pair of afternoon visitations for 16-year-old Wes Leonard of Fennville. Some piled off of school buses and hugged each other in the crisp winter air. ""He was just an all around great guy to play against,"" Craig Peterson, a player on the Bangor high school basketball team, told CNN affiliate WZZM. ""He was always respectful, he didn't run his mouth like most of the people would. He just liked to have fun, and was a great athlete."" Leonard's funeral is set for 10:30 a.m. Tuesday at Christ Memorial Church in nearby Holland. Leonard died moments after scoring the winning basket in overtime Thursday, securing a perfect season for the Fennville High School Blackhawks. Leonard scored his team's last four points in the 57-55 victory. An autopsy Friday revealed Leonard died of cardiac arrest due to an enlarged heart, according to a statement from Dr. David A.

"By . Sam Adams and Thomas Durante . UPDATED: . 02:57 EST, 19 February 2013 . Death: New images of Osama bin Laden's corpse have been discovered, but won't be released to the public if the Justice Department has its way . Additional images of Osama bin Laden taken shortly after his death in a daring Navy SEAL raid have been found by the CIA - but all of the photos will remain unseen by the public. The discovery was announced on Friday in a letter from the Justice Department. The new pictures would add to about 52 grusesome shots of the terror leader's body after he was killed in May 2011 by members of SEAL Team Six as they raided his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Those photos were requested in a Freedom of Information filing by Michael Bekesha of Judicial Watch after the federal government ruled they must be kept classified for national security purposes. In a letter to Mr Bekesha obtained by The Huffington Post, the Justice Department said that 'the CIA recently located seven additional images of Osama Bin Laden's body from the May 1, 2011 operation that resulted in his death.' The letter went on: 'These additional images were not located during the CIA's search for responsive records in this case. However, these images of Bin Laden's corpse are of the same nature as thematerials the CIA previously identified [as classified].' A lower court has already upheld the . government's argument that the photos should remain secret in the . interest of national security, according to WestWingReports.com. But a federal appeals court is now considering whether the 52 pictures should be released to Judicial Watch, a conservative-leaning legal watchdog. The group says it is not seeking any information about equipment or techniques used in the raid. Viewing the raid: President Obama and his key staffers watch the Navy SEAL mission at Osama bin Laden's compound in this White House photo . But President Obama has maintained that the photos' release could endanger American citizens. During a recent '60 Minutes' interview, Obama said it was important to ensure that 'very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence or as a propaganda tool.' After bin Laden was killed, the Obama administration said his body was buried at sea off the USS Carl Vinson - in accordance with Islamic tradition. The raid itself was completed shortly after 1am local time when bin Laden was shot once in the chest and once in the head by a U.S Navy Seal who announced: 'For God and country Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo.' Geronimo was the code-name given to the al-Qaeda leader. As Obama himself said in the White House Situation Room watching events unfold: 'We got him.' On TV: Bin Laden is shown watching himself on television in this video frame grab released by the U.S. Pentagon May 7, 2011, six days after his death .

"Stupid and insensitive: Democrat Brian Schweitzer issued a humble apology for his 'stupid and insensitive remarks' The former governor of Montana has been forced into a grovelling apology after saying House Majority Leader Eric Cantor sets off his 'gaydar' and likening the U.S. Intelligence Committee chairwoman to a prostitute. Brian Schweitzer sparked outrage over comments he made this week in a newspaper interview in which he speculated over Cantor's sexuality and railed against fellow Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein. But yesterday the Democrat issued a humble apology for his 'stupid and insensitive remarks' after they were published in the National Journal. 'I recently made a number of stupid and insensitive remarks to a reporter from the National Journal,' he wrote on his Facebook page. 'I am deeply sorry and sincerely apologize for my carelessness and disregard.' Schweitzer shocked colleagues and adversaries alike when he shared his perceptions of Republican Mr Cantor's sexuality following his surprising Virginia GOP loss last week to an unknown candidate. 'If you were just a regular person, you turned on the TV, and you saw Eric Cantor talking, I would say — and I'm fine with gay people, that's all right — but my gaydar is 60-70 percent,' he said. 'But he's not, I think, so I don't know. Again, I couldn't care less. I'm accepting.' He added: 'Don't hold this against me, but I'm going to blurt it out. How do I say this ... men in the South, they are a little effeminate. They just have effeminate mannerisms.' Cantor, who represents central Virginia and is outgoing House Majority Leader, has been married to his wife for 25 years and has three children. Ill-advised: In the interview, Schweitzer said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (left) sets off his 'gaydar' after likening Intelligence Committee chairperson Dianne Feinstein (right) to a prostitute . 'I am deeply sorry': Schweitzer made the humble apology on his Facebook page . Schweitzer made the slur after a similarly ill-advised gaffe in which he compared Sen. Feinstein, the Democratic senator from California who chairs the Intelligence Committee, to a prostitute whle discussing her position on intelligence gathering. 'She was the woman who was standing under the streetlight with her dress pulled all the way up over her knees,' he said. 'And now she says, 'I'm a nun,' when it comes to this spying. I mean, maybe that's the wrong metaphor — but she was all in!' And yesterday when asked about Schweitzer's comments, Feinstein laughed and said: 'You better keep him away from my husband.' Media fury: His comments were met with widespread disapproval with Republican National Committee Reince Priebus tweeting this . She then made a hand gesture indicating that Schweitzer’s remarks were not mentally balanced, adding: 'That’s all I’m going to say.' She then stepped onto the Senate floor. His comments were met with widespread disapproval. Republican National Committee Reince Priebus tweeted: 'If a Republican said *anything* about ""gaydar"" or a senator being a ""prostitute,"" the media fury would never end.' Republican Mike Coffman added: 'What kind of sexist scumbag says something like this? Diane Feinstein has more class in her pinky than Schweitzer has in his 20 gallon hat.' Schweitzer has hinted at a desire to compete in the Democrat presidential primaries in 2016, even if Hillary Clinton runs as well. Asked on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program in January about whether he would run for president in 2016, he said, “I haven’t decided that,” before adding, “It would ruin my life.” But he went on to tell the show's hosts that he would be a successful president, citing his record as governor of Montana. 'As governor, I spent eight years — every single year I was governor we had the largest budget surplus in the history of Montana,' Schweitzer said. 'I cut more taxes than any governor in the history of Montana, invested more new money in education. If a Democrat is good with money, you can’t beat ‘em.' He added: 'When you’ve got a Democrat like me who is good with money and Republicans have to admit it, they say, ""Oh, we don’t want to run against him again""'","Brian Schweitzer told newspaper reporter Cantor had 'effeminate qualities'

"(CNN) -- Two high-profile political officials linked to Guinea-Bissau's recently assassinated president were killed Friday, according to a statement from the West African country's interim army chief. The killings raised fears that a military coup may be under way. Guinea-Bissau Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Jr, left, and interim President Raimundo Pereira are currently out of the country. The military confirmed the killings of former Defense Minister Helder Proenca and presidential candidate Baciro Dabo, saying the men were killed because they were plotting a coup against the current government. The military said several members of the ruling party have been arrested on allegations of taking part in the plot, which included a plan to assassinate the current prime minister and the interim president, according to the statement from interim army chief Zamora Induta. However, the move by the military has raised fears that the military itself is plotting to take over the government, particularly since the arrests and killings took place while Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Jr., interim President Raimundo Pereira, and defense minister Artur Da Silva are out of the country. President Joao Bernardo Vieira, 69, was assassinated on March 2 during an attack on the presidential palace. The attack happened a day after Gen. Tagme Na Waie, chief of Guinea-Bissau's military, was killed in a bomb explosion in his office. The army and Guinea-Bissau's president clashed in the months prior to Vieira's assassination.

Paleontologists have discovered a family of triceratops, including one of the most complete skeletons ever found. The bones were uncovered on a ranch near Newcastle, Wyoming, by a team from the South Dakota-based Black Hills Institute of Geological Research and the Naturalis Biodiversity Center from the Netherlands. They believe the rare find of skeletons belonged either a to a parent group of triceratops or two females and a youngster. Paleontologists from the Black Hills Institute and Naturalis Biodiversity Center prepare the excavated bones . The team uncovered bones from three Triceratops at the dig near Newcastle, Wyoming . The three-horned dinosaurs lived more than 65million years ago and were often meals for predators, such as Tyrannosaurus Rex, which left behind only their skulls for dinosaur trophy hunters to find. Paleontologists also discovered the left foot and left leg of a T-Rex, which roamed the same area. It is believed the three Triceratops were attacked by a T-Rex. Black Hills Institute president Pete Larson said he was excited when he first saw the T-Rex foot, but he soon realized the potential presented by the Triceratops bones. 'We have been given a rare, I would say unprecedented, opportunity,' Larson told AP. The dig will continue for about four weeks as Larson while his 25-person team excavate the site.

Mr Larson told Rapid City Journal that this skeleton only needs to be 50 per cent complete to be among the four most complete skeletons to be found. Mr Larson said few Triceratops skeletons have ever been discovered, so the new find could provide a lot of information. He said the family group is an 'unprecedented' find. 'We have the opportunity to really rewrite the book on Triceratops,' he told Rapid City Journal. After the fossils are prepared and mounted into a display, they could be sent to the Naturalis gallery, he said.","The bones of three Triceratops were found by a team of 25 paleontologists .

"(CNN)  -- The Beijing Olympics has lost one of its major attractions after Maria Sharapova pulled out of the tennis tournament with a shoulder injury. Sharapova has treatment for a shoulder injury that has ruled her out of Olympics. The Russian world number three sustained the injury in beating Marta Domachowska of Poland at the WTA tournament in Montreal and immediately underwent an MRI scan to determine the extent of the problem. The result was not encouraging and Sharapova told her official Web site of her disappointment. ""I'm currently packing up real quick to hop on a plane to New York for a second opinion (on the injury) but I wanted to let you all know first that there is no chance of me competing in Beijing,"" she said. ""The timing is so unfortunate and this makes me more sad than anything."" It is another shattering setback for 21-year Sharapova who started the year with a brilliant victory at the Australian Open but has since been struggling with injury and loss of form. Wednesday's match in Montreal was her first since a disappointing exit from Wimbledon. ""After the match I knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder,"" she added. Sharapova's appearance in the final grand slam of the season at the U.S. Open, which takes place almost immediately after the Beijing Games, must also be in serious doubt.

"David Cameron has taken credit for the European Commission's acknowledgement that controls may be needed over the free movement of workers . David Cameron last night claimed victory after Brussels agreed that restrictions on the free movement of workers may be needed when new countries join the EU. Countries such as Montenegro, Serbia, Albania, Macedonia, Bosnia and Turkey have all applied to join the union and have started negotiations. The Prime Minister has long argued that transitional controls must be imposed if these countries are granted accession, to ensure that poor workers do not flood Western Europe looking for work. He has promised renegotiation with the EU to get powers back to Westminster, including powers to enable us to crack down on free movement, with an in/out referendum to be held by the end of 2017. Brussels has so far always argued against such moves, saying the free movement of workers was an unshakable tenet of the European project. But yesterday the European Commission gave Mr Cameron some hope. It published its updated ‘enlargement strategy’ for 2014/15, containing project reports for each applicant country. This report comes out every year but, for the first time, it makes clear that negotiations on future countries joining will need to address the nature of transitional controls and the possible need for a safeguard mechanism on the free movement of workers. The report said: ‘The possible need for and nature of transitional measures and/or a safeguard mechanism on the free movement of workers will be addressed in the course of accession negotiations on future enlargement, taking into account a future impact assessment.’ Mr Cameron said: ‘People across Europe are increasingly worried about the impact of immigration on their local community and this is an issue we need to address. ‘Less than a year ago, I kicked off a debate about how we prevent vast population movements across our continent when new countries join and I’m pleased that the Commission have acknowledged we need to look at this issue before more countries join. ‘This shows how when we lead the debate in Europe, we can shape it and make sure that the EU starts dealing with people’s concerns.’ A Number 10 source accepted that there is still much to be debated and agreed, but said it was ‘welcome’ to see the European Commission raising the issue. Meanwhile, last night a committee of MEPs finally approved Lord Hill as European commissioner for financial services – 45 in favour and 13 against. Lord Hill has been approved as European commissioner for financial services with a 45 to 13 vote . They had called back the Tory peer, a close ally of Mr Cameron, for further questioning after expressing concerns he would put the interests of the City above the EU.

"(CNN) -- Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is doing well as she recovers from surgery, officials said Tuesday. ""The operation has been satisfactory; it has turned out very well. The president is in her room and is in very good spirits,"" presidential spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro said in a statement. Doctors said there were no complications in the surgery to remove a blood clot from the surface of Fernandez's brain. Fernandez, 60, remained hospitalized in Buenos Aires and was ""progressing well,"" doctors said. Over the weekend, doctors diagnosed Fernandez with a subdural hematoma and said she needed to take a month off of work. A subdural hematoma is a blood clot on the brain's surface beneath its outer covering, called the dura. Often, in people over 60, a brain trauma can cause the blood vessels in the brain to tear and blood to clot. According to Argentina's constitution, the vice president assumes the presidency temporarily in the president's absence. In a televised speech Monday, Vice President Amado Boudou said the situation was similar to the time when Fernandez temporarily handed presidential powers over to him when she underwent surgery in January 2012 to remove her thyroid. ""This phase of 30 days is exactly the same,"" he said. ""There is no question or uncertainty, no strange question. She is taking her rest, a rest that she needs, and also that she deserves. ...

When deputies arrived at the home, the boy answered the door and told them his father was dead inside. During Tuesday's court hearing, the teen sat quietly and answered questions from Judge Fred Gannett to make sure the teen knew to what he was agreeing.

"They were hailed as national heroines after footage emerged of them fighting back against men alleged to have sexually harassed them on a bus in India. But a new video of Indian sisters Pooja, 19, and Aarti Kumar, 22, showing them starting a fight with another man has cast doubt on their story, fuelling accusations that they are 'man-beaters'. In a further twist, claims have also been made by female passengers on the bus in Haryana, north India, that the original fight was over seats, not because the young women were sexually harassed. Scroll down for video . A new video showing Indian sisters Pooja and Aarti Kumar starting a fight with a man in a park has emerged just days after the 'national heroines' were praised for fighting off alleged abusers on a bus . Man-beaters? One of the sisters is seen grabbing the unidentified man by the scruff of the neck. They claim he had verbally abused her, however this is clear from the video . Their 'self-defence' on Friday prompted widespread praise and the promise of a cash reward from the government, The Times reported. But the new video shows the women talking to a man sat on a bench in a park, before one of the sisters grabs him by the shirt while the other hits him with her bag. The man, seemingly confused by the attack, backs away and tries to hold one of the sisters' flailing arms as punches and slaps rain down on him. He is left with no option but to turn his back and run while one of the women casually checks her phone, as if nothing has happened. The Kumar sisters claim the man had been verbally harassing them but this is not clear from the video. The footage emerged amid claims by passengers on the same bus as the sisters, who study at Rohtak Government College, that the fight was over seats and that the girls were not sexually harassed, as they have claimed. The man holds back one of the young women's arms as she tried to punch her, but he was eventually forced to flee . Passengers watched as the sisters beat up their three alleged abusers with a belt after no one intervened to help them. But according to the Times of India, one witness, Bimla Devi, said: 'The two sisters were sitting on seat No. 8 which was allotted to an unwell woman passenger. 'When the boys asked the sisters to vacate the seat, the two refused and started fighting.' The sisters claim the men had been touching Aarti and that they grabbed her by the throat after she told them to stop. Coming to her sister's defence, Pooja removed her belt and began hitting, kicking and punching the man holding her sister until he let go. They say they were forced off the bus and were only able to escape the men after throwing a brick at then. Hitting back: Sisters Pooja, 19, left, and Aarti, 22, right, were filmed beating up a group of men who were verbally and physically abusing them on a bus in Rohtak, a district in the northern state of Haryana . The bus incident took place last week, when the Kumar sisters were on their way home from Rohtak Government College, and was filmed by one of the passengers .

I am not regretting it. I did the right thing.’ The three men, said to be soldiers-in-training, were arrested over the attack and have been released on bail.

"(CNN)In the final hours of a visit meant to demonstrate the deep societal ties between the United States and India, President Barack Obama briefly broke from his gushing praise for the new Prime Minister to make a soft but undisguised push toward gender equality and religious freedom. Speaking to an audience of students and activists in New Delhi, Obama declared the U.S. was India's best-suited partner as it makes rapid economic advances and appears poised to overtake China to become the world's most populous nation. But he didn't veil his take on recent attacks against women here, urging the country away from violence against women and religious minorities. Recent rapes in India have put harsh focus on India's gender politics. ""Every girl's life matters,"" Obama said in New Delhi. ""Every daughter deserves the same chance as our sons. And every woman should be able to go about her day—to walk the street, or ride the bus—and be safe and be treated with the respect and dignity that she deserves."" Sexual assaults became a high-profile problem in India after a young woman was gang-raped on a bus in New Delhi in 2012. The victim later died. Subsequent incidents of sexual violence — including at the hands of an Uber driver — placed global scrutiny on India's laws and culture. Obama traveled to India in the hopes of capitalizing on the deep personal warmth he's quickly developed with the new Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose effervescent welcome for the American president was covered enthusiastically and exhaustively by Indian media. That's a distant cry from Modi's arrival in the United States in September, which was marred by awkward questions over his visa status. Modi, a member of the right wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party, had previously been denied entry to the U.S. for an alleged role in a massacre of Muslims. Obama said on Tuesday it was the responsibility of every citizen to uphold the freedom of religious that's enshrined in India's constitution. ""Every person has the right to practice their faith how they choose, or to practice no faith at all, and to do so free from persecution and fear,"" Obama said. Obama's parting speech Tuesday was one of his few moments apart from Modi during his stay in India. The pair hugged upon Obama's arrival, sipped tea and meandered through a formal garden, and sat for hours behind rain-splattered bulletproof glass reviewing the annual Republic Day parade. White House officials say the level of personal interaction between the leaders exceeded even their already-high expectations, and claim the relationship greased the way for progress on a civilian nuclear deal to allow U.S. firms to construct power plants in India. Both sides also moved toward more defense cooperation and trade pacts. But despite their talk of cooperation, obvious differences persist between the U.S. and India that could preclude cooperation on areas like combating climate change. During his remarks Tuesday, Obama said India must commit to reducing emissions that cause climate change, even as the manufacturing and power plants that produce that pollution drive India to new economic heights. ""Here's the truth: even if countries like the United States curb our emissions, if growing countries like India—with soaring energy needs—don't also embrace cleaner fuels, then we don't stand a chance against climate change,"" Obama said.","Obama: U.S. is India's best-suited partner in economic advances .

"(CNN)  -- Austrian officials are seeking to secure the release of two Austrian nationals who were kidnapped by an al Qaeda group while vacationing in North Africa ahead of a midnight Sunday deadline. Reinhard and Christine Lenz, right, the parents of kidnapped Austrian Andrea Kloiber. ""There are efforts in all areas, unrelenting efforts to secure the earliest possible release of our citizens,"" Austrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Peter Launsky-Tieffenthal told CNN. The team of high-ranking government officials met Sunday morning and planned to work throughout the day, he said. Wolfgang Ebner, 51, and Andrea Kloiber, 44, were last heard from on February 18 while on a vacation in southern Tunisia, foreign ministry spokesman Martin Gaertner said. Earlier this month, the Austrian government received an audio message via the Internet from al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb claiming to have kidnapped the pair. The kidnappers' primary demand is the release of five prisoners in Algeria and Tunisia, Launsky-Tieffenthal said. While the kidnappers have set a midnight deadline, there are preliminary indications that it may be extended, he said. The government is in contact with authorities in Tunisia, Algeria, and Mali in an effort to find the missing duo, who are from the Austrian town of Hallein. A few weeks ago, the kidnappers released a set of written demands and six photographs that include images of the Austrians. Among the images was one that appeared to show the pair flanked by men holding assault rifles and a rocket launcher. Another appeared to show more than 15 group members -- several of them armed.

"Ahmed Abu Khatalla is accused of the 2011 attack on the US compound in Benghazi which claimed the life of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others . A Libyan militant accused of the 2012 terrorist attack on the US embassy in Benghazi was told that he faces the death penalty after a grand jury indicted him on 18 charges. Ahmed Abu Khatalla, 43, was captured by US special forces in June and brought to the court where a grand jury decided upon which charges he should face. Khatalla was initially held on one count of conspiracy to support terrorists resulting in the death of US officials. But additional charges were added to the indictment. As a result of the indictment, Khatalla faces multiple death penalty charges. Among the capital charges, Khatalla is accused of the murder of an internationally protected person as well as killing a person in a federal facility. After his arrest, Khatalla was brought to the US on a naval vessel and remains in custody in Alexandra, Virginia. Khatalla has so far pleaded guilty although he is due to return to court in Washington next week. His public defender Michelle Peterson said: 'It is important to remember that an indictment is merely a set of allegations or charges, it is not evidence. We will vigorously defend Mr. Abu Khatallah? in court where the government will be forced to prove his guilt, based upon actual evidence.' Khatalla is accused of being a ringleader in the September 11, 2012 attack which killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other US nationals. It is also claimed that the terrorists ransacked a number of classified computers inside in the compoud. According to prosecutors, Khattala drove to the diplomatic mission with other militants and a group of about 20 breached the main gate and later launched an attack with assault rifles, grenades and other weapons. That initial attack killed Stevens and communications specialist Sean Smith and set the mission ablaze. Prosecutors say Khattala supervised the plunder of sensitive information from that building, then returned to a camp in Benghazi where a large group began assembling for an attack on a second building known as the annex. The attack on that facility, including a precision mortar barrage, resulted in the deaths of security officers Tyrone Snowden Woods and Glen Anthony Doherty, authorities say. US ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens was among four Americans killed in the 2011 terrorist attack . The gunmen attacked the embassy compound in Benghazi and an adjacent CIA facility . Gunmen celebrated inside the compound's perimeter in the aftermath of the attack on September 11, 2011 . In the attack's immediate aftermath, Obama administration officials, including Susan Rice, currently White House national security adviser, stoked political controversy by initially saying the attack was a spontaneous protest against an anti-Muslim video that had surfaced in the United States. Evidence later emerged that U.S. agencies had been warning for months about weak security and possible attacks against U.S. facilities in Libya. Evidence also emerged that soon after the attack, the United States had strong reason to believe that organized militant groups had been involved. In media interviews before his capture by U.S. forces, Khatallah denied involvement in the attacks against a compound used by the State Department as a consular office and a nearby compound used by the CIA as its Benghazi base. The new U.S. indictment alleges Khatallah had been the commander of an militant Islamist militia called Ubaydah bin Jarrah. That group later merged with another Libyan group called Ansar al Sharia, and Khatallah became one of its Benghazi-based leaders, U.S. authorities said.","Ahmed Abu Khatalla is believed to have masterminded the 2011 terror attack .

"(CNN) -- Some people believed that one of the most democratic ways out of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine was to let people of Crimea decide their fates for themselves through a referendum. But there were a few serious flaws with that ""democratic"" approach. Sunday, March 16, was a day many Ukrainians waited for with concern and dread. Originally, the referendum was planned for May 25, then moved up to March 30 and then once again moved to March 16. Prime Minister Sergey Aksyonov and Vladimir Konstantinov, speaker of Crimean Parliament, were eager to accomplish the task Russian President Vladimir Putin had given them. That task was to provide Russia with some kind of excuse for a military intervention that had in fact started on February 28, when there were reports of Russian soldiers occupying the Crimean Peninsula. Long before the referendum took place, the international community expressed concerns about its legitimacy, and many people in Ukraine considered it illegal. This kind of referendum violates the Ukrainian Constitution, which specifies that it can be done only countrywide. And does this mean that Russia can invade any country where there is a Russian-speaking enclave? Russia even owned Alaska once. Should they get that back, too? Crimea's vote: Was it legal? To no surprise, Aksyonov reported that more than 80% of people in Crimea voted in the referendum and 96% voted for Crimea to join Russia. The results themselves didn't matter, as everybody knew they would be false. There are certainly some people who have been brainwashed by Russian TV channels (Ukrainian stations have been cut off in Crimea) and do believe in lies that in Russia Crimea will be given all kinds of advantages and privileges. But also consider that the vote took place under the guns of Russian troops and residents were given less than two weeks to prepare. It is unsafe to be pro-Ukrainian in Crimea right now, as the region is controlled by Russian military and hired thugs. The announcement of results signaled to the people of Ukraine that a quiet waiting period of our conflict with Russia is probably over. Even though the United Nations, European Union, United States and other international observers do not recognize results of referendum, Russia is still claiming that Crimea will join with them. So the tension has come up to higher levels. The Ukrainian Parliament has announced partial mobilization of army reserves. Annexation of Crimea opportune or opportunistic? My friends and colleagues in Crimea tell me that people are standing in long lines to withdraw money from banks. Many ATMs do not have cash, and stores do not accept credit cards. Retired people are concerned about their pensions being paid on time. Ukrainians are still not sure what their preparations should be. Will our troops try to liberate Crimea from Russian invaders? Will Russian troops try to invade eastern regions of Ukraine where Russian provocateurs have been trying to cause trouble, too? Did Putin set his goals not just for Crimea but the whole of Ukraine? Putin keeps talking about Ukraine as a failed state and the Ukrainian government as not legitimate, though it's recognized by all other countries in the world. The bottom line is this: The referendum is a farce that the whole world has pronounced illegitimate, but it is being used by Putin to escalate conflict to next level. His ambitions for restoring the Soviet Union in the form of a new Russian Empire are no secret. Even Putin's allies, such as Belarus and Kazakhstan, are nervous. It's hard to not be concerned if you live anywhere in Ukraine -- or in Poland, Latvia, Lithuania or Estonia. Are you in Ukraine, Crimea or Russia? Have you witnessed the unrest? What do you think about the region's future? Share your stories with CNN iReport, but please stay safe.

"Police say Australian bikie gangs are expanding into South East Asia to bolster their underworld operations. The gangs are establishing in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Cambodia, where local chapters of the clubs are recruiting new members and working with their Australian counterparts. The overseas expansion of local gangs is one of the key factors addressed by the National Anti-Gang Squad, based on the Gold Coast. The group leads investigations into the activities of Australian-based gangs overseas and their links to crime in Australia. Thai members of the Rebels Club, the largest Australian bikie club. Police believe Australian bikie gangs are are expanding aggressivelyinto south-east Asia . It is believed the gangs are being formed in locations that lack anti-gang resources as Australia . The social media accounts of the overseas offshoots of the Australian bikie clubs feature pictures of firearms . In June, the Gang Squad hosted a South East Asia conference in Bangkok to tackle the mounting threat of outlaw motorcycle gangs. It was attended by 75 State and territory police officers from Australia, as well as officers from Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia Vietnam Singapore and America. The Commander of the Gangs Squad in NSW Detective Superintendant Deb Wallace told Daily Mail: 'We keep a very close eye on outlaw motorcycle gangs and, in recent years, have observed a number of gang members moving overseas.' 'In particular, the Rebels have made a concerted effort to expand their international footprint', he said. 'The rationale behind this expansion is driven largely by organised crime objectives. Chapters have been established to tap into underworld business opportunities in overseas markets, particularly in locations where law enforcement agencies don't have the same level of anti-gang resources or expertise as we do here in NSW.' The Rebels MC have made the largest expansion into south-east Asia. They club has 2000 members in Australia alone, making them the largest motorcycle club in the country . The Minister for Justice Michael Keenan said the National Anti Gang Squad Australia is 'leading the fight against Outlaw Motorcycle Gang criminal highways through South East Asia.' 'The activities of organised crime groups and outlaw motorcycle gangs are an ongoing threat to Australia. 'They are violent predators who profit from the misery of drug trafficking, drug manufacturing, extortion, prostitution and firearms trafficking.' The Rebels MC have 2000 members in Australia alone, making them the largest motorcycle club in the country. The Rebels, who were founded in Brisbane in the late 1960's, have successfully expanded into Malta and New Zealand. They have now established chapters in Thailand, Indonesia Malaysia and Cambodia. The social media accounts of the Indonesian Rebels club features images of firearms. In July, the head of the rebels Alex Vella had his Visa cancelled while on holiday in his home country of Malta, where he has since been stranded. The news of overseas expansion comes amid harsh national crackdowns on the clubs, particularly in Queensland, where the Campbell Newman Government introduced the Vicious Lawless Association Disestablishment Act  to combat the gangs in 2013.

"BARCELONA (Reuters) -- ""Galactic Suite"", the first hotel planned in space, expects to open for business in 2012 and would allow guests to travel around the world in 80 minutes. An artist's impression of the Galactic Suite, where guests would enjoy views of the Earth during their three-day stay . Its Barcelona-based architects say the space hotel will be the most expensive in the galaxy, costing $4 million for a three-day stay. During that time guests would see the sun rise 15 times a day and use Velcro suits to crawl around their pod rooms by sticking themselves to the walls like Spiderman. Company director Xavier Claramunt says the three-bedroom boutique hotel's joined-up pod structure, which makes it look like a model of molecules, was dictated by the fact that each pod room had to fit inside a rocket to be taken into space. ""It's the bathrooms in zero gravity that are the biggest challenge,"" says Claramunt. ""How to accommodate the more intimate activities of the guests is not easy."" But they may have solved the issue of how to take a shower in weightlessness -- the guests will enter a spa room in which bubbles of water will float around. When guests are not admiring the view from their portholes they will take part in scientific experiments on space travel. Galactic Suite began as a hobby for former aerospace engineer Claramunt, until a space enthusiast decided to make the science fiction fantasy a reality by fronting most of the $3 billion needed to build the hotel. An American company intent on colonizing Mars, which sees Galaxy Suite as a first step, has since come on board, and private investors from Japan, the United States and the United Arab Emirates are in talks. Plenty rich enough . If Claramunt is secretive about the identity of his generous backer, he is more forthcoming about the custom he can expect. ""We have calculated that there are 40,000 people in the world who could afford to stay at the hotel. Whether they will want to spend money on going into space, we just don't know."" Four million dollars might be a lot to spend on a holiday, but those in the nascent space tourism industry say hoteliers have been slow on the uptake because no one thought the cost of space travel would come down as quickly as it has. Galactic Suite said the price included not only three nights in space. Guests also get eight weeks of intensive training at a James Bond-style space camp on a tropical island. ""There is fear associated with going into space,"" said Claramunt. ""That's why the shuttle rocket will remain fixed to the space hotel for the duration of the guests' stay, so they know they can get home again."" In an era of concern over climate change, Galaxy Suite has no plans so far to offset the pollution implications of sending a rocket to carry just six guests at a time into space. ""But,"" says Claramunt, ""I'm hopeful that the impact of seeing the earth from a distance will stimulate the guests' urge to value and protect our planet."" ...........................................

"(CNN) -- Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, made its own history Tuesday as its homicide rate reached 3,000 deaths for the year -- 10 times the number of killings annually that the border city counted just a few years ago. With two weeks left in the year, 2010 is now the deadliest year Juarez has ever seen, a spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office told CNN. ""At 12:15 p.m. we hit 3,000 murders for the year. The state attorney general's office had the number at 2,998 as of Monday and with the two murders today that brings us to 3,000,"" spokesman Arturo Sandoval said in a phone interview with CNN late Tuesday. The killings happened in two separate incidents, according to Sandoval. One of the victims was found shot dead in a car and the other was shot and killed in front of relatives. The victims, 35 and 46 respectively, were both males, Sandoval said. Before a spasm of drug-related violence hit the city in 2008, the bloodiest year in Juarez was around 300, according to Sandoval.

"Chelsea Manning, the U.S. soldier serving a 35-year sentence for leaking a trove of classified documents to WikiLeaks, has spoken out from his military prison cell in Kansas to warn Americans that they are being lied to about Iraq once more. In a remarkable New York Times Op-Ed piece written from behind bars, Manning said she believes the 'limits on press freedom and excessive government secrecy make it impossible for Americans to grasp fully what is happening in the wars we finance.' Manning, who changed her name from Bradley after beginning sex-reassignment treatments, also defended her leak of 700,000 secret documents - the largest leak of U.S. intelligence in history. 'I understand that my actions violated the law. However, the concerns that motivated me have not been resolved,' she wrote. Convicted: Manning is serving a 35-year prison sentence on espionage charges and other offenses for passing along 700,000 secret documents to WikiLeaks . 'As Iraq erupts in civil war and America again contemplates intervention, that unfinished business should give new urgency to the question of how the United States military controlled the media coverage of its long involvement there and in Afghanistan.' President Barack Obama said this week he was 'looking at all the options' to halt the offensive that has brought militants within 50 miles of Baghdad's city limits, but ruled out any return of U.S. combat troops. Obama has been under mounting fire from Republican critics over the swift collapse of Iraq's security forces, which Washington spent billions of dollars training and equipping before pulling out its own troops in 2011. While the US military was upbeat in its public outlook on the 2010 Iraqi parliamentary elections, suggesting it had helped bring stability and democracy to the country, 'those of us stationed there were acutely aware of a more complicated reality,' Manning wrote. 'Military and diplomatic reports coming across my desk detailed a brutal crackdown against political dissidents by the Iraqi Ministry of Interior and federal police, on behalf of Prime Minister Nuri Al-Maliki. Detainees were often tortured, or even killed.' Critical: Manning's piece has claimed that the US is lying to Americans about Iraq . Manning, a former US Army intelligence analyst, said she was 'shocked by our military's complicity in the corruption of that election. Yet these deeply troubling details flew under the American media's radar.' She claimed she and other U.S. soldiers were ordered to help the government of President al-Maliki root out dissenters, including intellectuals who simply criticized the government's policies. The U.S. military referred to such dissenters as  'anti-Iraqi.' Criticizing the military's practice of embedding journalists, Manning charged that 'the current limits on press freedom and excessive government secrecy make it impossible for Americans to grasp fully what is happening in the wars we finance.' Manning pointed at that at any given time, there were no more than 12 journalists embedded with U.S. forces in Iraq - a nation of 31million people. 'In contrast to the solid, nuanced briefings we created on the ground, the news available to the public was flooded with foggy speculation and simplifications,' she wrote. She also added that contractors were hired to vet journalists for embed based on how likely they were to produce favorable coverage. Furthermore, the military uses the threat of pulling a journalist's embed at any time to help quash negative reports and convince journalists to self-censor, she claims. Manning is serving out the prison sentence at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas and had requested a name change after court-martial proceedings revealed the soldier's emotional turmoil over sexual identity. A US Army general denied clemency to Manning in April, upholding the 35-year sentence.","Detained US soldier Chelsea Manning warned Americans they were being lied to about Iraq once more in a recent op-ed .

"Zoo does not want Kitra, aged 10, to breed yet . She lives in an enclosure with her father and several others . By . Nina Golgowski . Last updated at 11:09 PM on 25th January 2012 . An orangutan at a Cleveland zoo  has become the of it's kind in North America to receive an implanted birth control device. Two doctors, including a gynecologist from the Cleveland Clinic, implanted the contraceptive into the 10-year-old orangutan named Kitra on Tuesday morning. Not wanting to separate her from the group in which she lives, which includes her mother and father, the zoo worked to find a safe alternative for her. Orangutans are social animals, explained zoo spokesperson Sue Allen. Growing up: Kitra the orangutan received the first U.S. inserted contraceptive to an orangutan Tuesday after her Cleveland zoologist heard of the process successfully done overseas . Having tried with negative results other contraceptives to prevent pregnancy with the primates, the clinic's Gynecologist Dr Judith Volkar worked with the zoo's Dr. Mike Selig to implant a contraceptive called Implanon at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo after hearing of its success with primates in Europe. Dr Volkar has inserted this kind of contraceptive before in humans, for whom it was originally designed, but Kitra was her personal first orangutan. Dr Selig's who learned from her. The Implanon contraceptive, about an inch-and-a-half in length and slightly thicker than lead found in a pencil, is inserted in the arm. Typically the Implanon contraceptive is recommended to be changed every three years. Method: The chosen Implanon contraceptive, about an inch-and-a-half in length and slightly thicker than lead found in a pencil, was designed for humans and is inserted in the arm . Being a young and developing Bornean orangutan, General curator Geoffrey Hall says the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo isn't ready for her to breed, at least not yet. The zoo reported the procedure to have gone well and Kitra back on her feet within hours. 'We as humans have received so much from the animals,' Dr Volkar told Cleveland.com after the procedure. 'It's good to be able to give something back,' she said. Home and family: The orangutan from the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo lives in their rainforest portion with her mother, father and two others making her separation from the others for fear of her becoming pregnant cruel if a contraceptive wasn't found . Kitra was re-introduced to the zoo's Rain Forest exhibit that contains four other orangutans. In exchange for her help, Dr. Volkar was given a backstage tour of the zoo's more exotic animals and got to sit on a giant tortoise. When asked if she had ever had the opportunity at the Cleveland Clinic, Dr Volkar said: 'Never. Not once.' The zoo's Aldabra tortoise is described as being the size of a coffee table and weighting around 400 pounds.","Zoo does not want Kitra, aged 10, to breed yet .

"As well as visiting the Jurassic Coast and having a photograph next to the cliff which started the first series off, die-hard Broachchurch fans can now go one better. DI Alec Hardy's, played by David Tennant, home in the hit ITV drama is up for sale. The tiny wooden blue hut on the banks of the River Brit in West Bay, Dorset, has gone on the market for £275,000 as the so-called 'Broachchurch effect' kicks in. The blue chalet made famous by David Tennant's character in Broadchurch has gone on the market for £275k . David Tennant broods: Series producers reportedly hired the chalet for two separate periods of two weeks . Previously let as a holiday chalet for as little as £41 per night, the 100 year old two-bed waterfront property has recently been swamped with interest since Broadchurch first aired in 2013. It's one of four homes built around 1900 next to the River Brit, can only be reached by foot and has the unique position of looking out across the harbour, river and meadows behind. Series producers reportedly hired the chalet for two separate periods of two weeks while filming the ITV drama, home to David Tennant's brooding lead character. The hut sits on the bank of the River Brit in  Dorset and has been rent out as a holiday let for two years . The owner Abbey Evans (above) has listed the property with estate agents Lyme Coast Holidays . When asked about the proposed uplift in price thanks to the show Malcolm Gill, of estate agents Lyme Coast Holidays, said, 'It's impossible to quantify but I would say it has probably benefitted from an uplift of between £25,000 and £50,000.' 'We have tried to price it fairly and sensibly without being greedy and I think the owner will be pleasantly surprised to achieve the asking price.' He may be right to be optimistic as hotel searches to West Bay, Dorset, have  seen an increase of 50 per cent, according to research conducted by hotel.com, and house prices in the picturesque areas have risen by the same amount. Britbank is described on Lyme Coast Holiday's website as a 'very unusual Edwardian seaside home' Previously let as a holiday chalet for £41 a week, the 100 year old  property has  been swamped with interest . The blue hut called Britbank is described on Lyme Coast Holiday's website as a 'very unusual Edwardian seaside home right on the riverbank of the river Brit and only a few yards from the sandy beach and the iconic hamstone cliff which also featured in the series on location in West Bay'. It says that while the chalet has successfully been a holiday let for the past two years the artist and sculptor owner, Abbey Evans, has decided to put it up for sale. The tiny property was spotted by Chris Chibnall, the creator of Broadchurch, who lives in nearby Bridport . David Tennant and Olivia Colman in character: Chibnall has said chalet 'holds lots – if not all – of the secrets' The property was spotted by Chris Chibnall, the creator of Broadchurch, who lives in nearby Bridport, when he was writing the first series in a local café. At the time, Tenant's character was still being developed and it is thought that much of the second series was then created around the idea of the Jurassic Coast chalet as Tenant's base. Chibnall has said the chalet 'holds lots – if not all – of the secrets'. Mr Evans, 60, bought the chalet in 2000 and said it held wonderful memories for both him and his son.

"It looks like Jon Corzine’s love of risk-taking is finally proving to bring him down after his securities fund today filed for bankruptcy protection. Futures brokerage MF Global Holdings filed after a tentative deal with a buyer fell apart, marking a stunning failure for its 64-year-old CEO. His career has taken him to the top echelons of Wall Street as Goldman Sachs CEO, into politics as a U.S. senator and to New Jersey governor. Troubled: Jon Corzine, MF Global Holdings CEO, left, leaves his office in Manhattan, New York, on Monday as it filed for bankruptcy protection . But the MF Global meltdown makes it the biggest U.S. casualty of Europe’s debt crisis, as it pays the price for his risky bets on sovereign debt. The Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing came after talks to sell a variety of assets to Interactive Brokers Group reportedly broke down earlier on Monday. It also comes one week after MF Global, whose shares plunged 66 per cent last week, reported its biggest-ever quarterly loss. Besides the loss of $186.6million for the fiscal second quarter, investors were spooked when MF Global's debt was downgraded to junk status. The seventh-largest bankruptcy in U.S. history by assets is reminiscent of when Lehman Brothers fell at the peak of the financial crisis in 2008. MF Global traders and counter-parties were left scrambling and confused on Monday, as the fund halted its shares. Risk-taker: His career has taken him to the top echelons of Wall Street as Goldman Sachs CEO, into politics as a U.S. senator and to New Jersey governor . But it did not file for bankruptcy until well after the U.S. markets opened. ‘Ultimately it will have lost all confidence of its investor base,’ said Michael Epstein, a restructuring adviser with CRG Partners. 'Ultimately it will have lost all . confidence of its investor base... in some respects, it's a baby Lehman, in effect' Michael Epstein, restructuring . adviser with CRG Partners . ‘I'm not sure what restructuring it actually does. In some respects, it's a baby Lehman, in effect.’ Three traders wearing MF Global jackets were seen leaving the Chicago Board of Trade prior to the opening of pit trading. Floor sources said they had been turned away after their security access cards were denied. Jeff Carter, an independent futures trader in Chicago, said the impact on the markets should be smaller and nothing like when Lehman failed. Mr Corzine's decision to chase yield by going after European sovereign debt was clearly ill-advised and always seemed much too risky, he said. Money man: Mr Corzine is also a top fundraiser for Barack Obama, helping raise at least $500,000 for the President's re-election campaign since April . MF Global scrambled through the weekend and into Monday to find buyers for all or parts of the company. But at the same time it was hiring restructuring and bankruptcy advisers in case nothing could be done. Mr Corzine was trying to transform it from a brokerage that mainly places customers' trades on exchanges into betting with its own capital. He took over MF Global early last year. It has turned a profit just three times in the past 12 quarters. Mr Corzine is also a top fundraiser for Barack Obama, helping raise at least $500,000 for the President’s re-election campaign since April. MF Global, which filed in New York, has assets of $41.05billion and liabilities of $39.68billion, according to its bankruptcy petition. 'The real question is how many assets will be left to transfer,' said Niamh Alexander, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Bank stocks dropped broadly on Monday . after the bankruptcy filing.

"Fewer than one in seven child sex abuse cases probed by Britain's largest police force have led to criminal charges, figures have revealed. Scotland Yard investigated 7,205 reports of serious attacks on under-16s between 2010 and October last year - just 989 of which (14 per cent) ended with a person being prosecuted. Fewer offenders still were convicted after prosecutors, who were handed details by London's Metropolitan Police, tested cases against them through the courts. Failed: One in seven child sex abuse claims in London end in prosecution, figures show (posed by model) The figures, obtained by Mike Sullivan for the Sun on Sunday, show police success rates lagging despite a major crackdown on child sex abuse. The Met reportedly brought in up to 100 extra officers in 2013 to tackle sex abuse cases including child exploitation and the threat of grooming gangs. The shake-up was an attempt to improve the Met's controversial Operation Sapphire rape unit after it was accused of failings in previous years. An IPCC report in 2013 found 'under-performing and over-stretched' officers in Southwark, south London, had encourage adult victims to retract their allegations to boost detection rates. Today's figures are said to include rape, gang rape, child trafficking and sexual assault. Changes: The Met Police reportedly brought in up to 100 extra officers in 2013 to tackle sex abuse cases . Last year the NSPCC warned child rape rates were even worse than official figures suggest because many cases are never reported to the authorities. 'Not all cases come to the attention of the police and, even if they do, they may decide it is not in the best interests of the child to investigate an incident as a criminal offence,' a spokesman said. The charity previously said some child sex abuse cases were collapsing because children were being denied the support they needed to give evidence in court. Claiming fewer than a quarter of 23,000 offences in 2012 ended in a prosecution, the charity said all children giving evidence should have an intermediary to help deal with 'hostile' questioning. Responding to the call, the government issued new guidelines saying child sex abuse cases should only be dealt with by specialist prosecutors who ignore 'myths, stereotypes and prejudices'. Victims must also be offered 'appropriate support' such as counselling and criminal cases should be heard in court with as few delays as possible, the guidelines added. The Metropolitan Police did not immediately return requests for comment on today's figures.","Figures show Met Police told of 7,205 serious sex attacks on under-16s .

"(CNN) -- Fearing that flocks of unmanned aircraft might soon traverse U.S. skies, the Federal Aviation Administration on Friday quickly appealed a judge's ruling that the agency does not have the authority to regulate commercial drones. The case involves Raphael Pirker, a drone enthusiast fined $10,000 by the FAA for using his 56-inch foam glider to take promotional videos of the University of Virginia Medical Center. The FAA said Pirker's flight ran afoul of its strict rules governing the commercial use of drones. On Friday, less than 24 hours after losing its case, the FAA said it was appealing the decision by Patrick Geraghty, an administrative law judge with the National Transportation Safety Board. ""The agency is concerned that this decision could impact ... the safety of people and property on the ground,"" the FAA said in a statement. Geraghty said FAA regulations approved for manned aircraft did not apply to unmanned aircraft any more than they applied to paper airplanes or balsa wood planes. Pirker's attorney, Brendan Schulman, called it ""a tremendously significant decision for model aircraft and commercial drone operators."" ""As a general matter, the decision finds that the FAA's 2007 policy statement banning the commercial use of model aircraft is not enforceable. It would appear to me to have a very significant impact on other operators,"" Schulman said. But the decision confounded the FAA, which as recently as last week had publicized its restrictions on commercial use of drones. In a press release headlined ""Busting Myths about the FAA and Unmanned Aircraft,"" it stressed that UAS enthusiasts could not use drones for commercial purposes. ""A commercial flight requires a certified aircraft, a licensed pilot and operating approval. To date, only one operation has met these criteria, using Insitu's ScanEagle, and authorization was limited to the Arctic,"" the FAA's Busting Myths release said. ""There are no shades of gray in FAA regulations,"" the FAA continued. ""Anyone who wants to fly an aircraft-manned or unmanned-in U.S. airspace needs some level of FAA approval."" The flight that got Pirker in trouble occurred October 17, 2011, when he remotely piloted a $130 RiteWing Zephyr II aircraft at the campus medical center. The FAA investigated, and the following April it proposed a $10,000 civil penalty, saying that Pirker operated the plane ""in a careless or reckless manner so as to endanger the life or property of another."" Pirker operated the aircraft within about 50 feet of numerous individuals, about 20 feet of a crowded street, and within approximately 100 feet of an active heliport at UVA, the FAA alleged. One person had to take ""evasive measures"" to avoid being struck by the aircraft, the agency said. Pirker appealed the case to the NTSB, where the case went before Geraghty. The FAA is appealing the matter to the full safety board.","Raphael Pirker remotely piloted a model plane for commercial purposes .

"An interest rate rise will hit workers long before most see their pay increase, the Bank of England governor warned yesterday. Mark Carney said a rise was ‘getting closer’, indicating it is likely to take place next spring in line with predictions. For workers going through the biggest squeeze on pay since the 1920s, this will mean facing the threat of higher mortgage payments before benefiting from a higher salary. The combination will put impossible pressure on millions of families. Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney said 'the Great Recession' had been a 'calamity' for workers . Mr Carney admitted: ‘We are under no illusions. The Great Recession was a calamity. Britain’s workers have borne many of the consequences.’ But he added: ‘The point at which interest rates also begin to normalise is getting closer . . . You can expect interest rates to begin to rise.’ Economists expect interest rates, frozen at a record low of 0.5 per cent since March 2009, will be ‘beginning to increase by the spring and thereafter rising very gradually’, he said. It raises the explosive prospect of the first rise for seven years hitting homeowners weeks before the general election in May. Mr Carney said the pay squeeze will go on for several more years, adding that a typical worker’s wages, adjusted for the cost of living, have fallen by a tenth since the start of the crisis. Speaking at the Trades Union Congress in Liverpool, he said: ‘To find such a fall in the past, you would have to go back to the early 1920s.’ Pay rises are still ‘very weak’, he said, 0.6 per cent on average, and are set to show only ‘a modest pick up over coming quarters’. It will take until 2017 for pay rises to reach 4 per cent, he said, but they should exceed inflation ‘around the middle of next year’. Mr Carney said Britons ‘deserve’ a pay rise after a six-year squeeze. He repeated the Bank’s mantra that interest rate rises will be ‘gradual and limited’. Since the Bank was founded in 1694, the average level of interest rates has been 5 per cent. Mr Carney said they will not hit this level in the next few years. He rubbished the idea that the Tories had asked him not to raise rates on the eve of an election. Frances O'Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, told the annual conference in Liverpool that Britain needed a pay rise . The Bank is ‘absolutely indifferent to the political cycle, to who is in government, who might be in government, who was in government’, he insisted. Mr Carney said unemployment, currently more than two million, will continue to fall. While other countries, such as the US, face ‘a clear danger of a misplaced, if not lost, generation of workers’, he said Britain’s labour market was impressively resilient. The unemployment rate, now 6.4 per cent, will fall to 5.5 per cent ‘over the next three years’ with 1.2million new jobs, he said. Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said Mr Carney ‘recognised the pain felt by British workers’. Len McCluskey, leader of the Unite union, said the speech gave a ‘somewhat depressing’ message that people are working longer for less pay. Howard Archer, of consultancy IHS Global Insight, said the speech ‘seems to support the view that a very gradual increase in interest rates is likely to get under way in February or soon afterwards’.","Bank of England Governor spoke to the Trades Union Congress today .

"(CNN) -- A giant menorah will light the sky above New York on Wednesday to mark the start of Hanukkah, a Jewish holiday celebrated for eight days and nights. Jews celebrate Hanukkah by lighting candles each night in a menorah, an eight-branch candelabra with a ninth, elevated branch known as a shamash. Organizers will light the first candle of what they called the world's largest menorah at Central Park. Lighting of the menorah will be held at 5:30 p.m. daily through December 8. The 32-foot high, gold-colored, 4,000 pound steel structure features genuine oil lamps, according to organizers. It has glass chimneys to protect the lights from strong winds. The menorah marks Hanukkah, the Jewish Festival of Lights that mostly falls in December. ""The menorah stands as a symbol of freedom and democracy, strength and inspiration, delivering a timely and poignant message to each person on an individual basis,"" said Rabbi Shmuel M. Butman, director Lubavitch Youth Organization. The shamash, which is lit first, is used to light the others candles each night of the holiday. The holiday of Hanukkah celebrates the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem after Syrians were chased out of the Holy Land. It also marks the eight days that a menorah burned with one day's worth of oil. Celebrants exchange small gifts during Hanukkah.

A daughter has criticised her elderly father's carers for making a sandwich out of mouldy bread for his lunch. Rita Sinnix was appalled to hear that her 77-year-old father was given the rotten snack with the green and black mould 'hidden' by jam and butter. He said it burned the back of his throat and later broke down and sobbed when he complained of other failings in the care provided by Dawn to Dusk Community Care at his sheltered accommodation in Crayford, Kent. Rotten: Rita Sinnix was appalled after her 77-year-old father said he had been given the sandwich which had green and black mould . Mrs Sinnix, 55, complained to social services officials who said they have now introduced a new 'care package' for her father. She said: 'A man who has cared and loved his family and worked his whole life shouldn't be left to complain about a poor sandwich. 'He complained there was a burning at the back of his throat when he ate his sandwich. We never dreamed it would be the bread but when we looked we saw the loaf was off and green. 'This is care he pays over £300 a month for. It's disgusting. 'I think of all those old people who rely solely on the care of these people because they don't have family around them - they haven't got a hope for happiness.' Mrs Sinnix, who does not want to identify her father, said: 'We couldn't believe he was being treated so badly. At Christmas he broke down and sobbed telling us that the care hadn't been right. Complaint: Mrs Sinnix complained to social services officials who said they have now introduced a new 'care package' for her father, who broke down in tears after he told his daughter about the care he had received . 'He had a favourite carer but she allowed another carer to serve him up the mouldy bread so she had to go. It really hurt dad's feelings because he trusted her and liked her.' Mrs Sinnix said her father, a former papermill worker, was bipolar and suffers from depression and emphysema. A carer goes to his home each day to wash him and make his lunch. Complaint: Rita Sinnix discovered her elderly father had eaten the mouldy sandwich prepared by carers . The grandfather-of-seven is still married but his wife is too unwell to care for him and they live apart. Mrs Sinnix added: 'My father is very independent and does not like people coming into his home. That is why we insisted only one carer at a time should visit him. 'The carers claimed they struggled to cope with the care of my father, but then they should have spoken to us and increased the care needed.' Dawn Mills, the owner of Dawn to Dusk Community Care, based in Crayford, Kent, today declined to comment, but said: 'I cannot confirm anything - I suggest you talk to social services.' A spokesman for Kent County Council adult services, which employs the services of Dawn to Dusk, said: 'When we were informed about the family's concerns about the care the gentleman was receiving we worked with them and the agency to resolve these issues. 'When the issues continued, we made the decision, with the family, to change the agency providing care to him. The family has confirmed the new care package is working well.' They said: 'We looked into whether other service users had suffered difficulties with this agency but no other problems had arisen. 'We monitor the standards of domiciliary care providers on a regular basis. High quality of care is our priority.'","Rita Sinnix claims her elderly father was given mouldy sandwich .

"By . Simon Jones . Sunderland are targeting a move for Jack Rodwell as the Manchester City midfielder goes in search of first team football. The 23-year-old has spent two seasons at the club, but he's failed to make much of an impact under two managers at the Etihad, making just 26 appearances in all competitions and scoring twice in the process. Rodwell was bought from Everton by Roberto Mancini for an initial fee of £12million in 2012, but was held back by a series of injuries and managed just 11 Premier League appearances. Wanted: Jack Rodwell is being chased by Sunderland . Rare outing: Rodwell shakes hands with Vincent Kompany following a League Cup tie with Leicester . And his fortunes did not improve at all last season, with Manuel Pellegrini giving him just 10 games in all competitions. Rodwell also has three caps for England, but only one of them has come whilst he has been in Manchester - a substitute cameo during a 2-2 draw against Brazil at the Maracana last June.

"(CNN)A little more than a minute. That's all it took for the exchange to turn deadly. The Police Department in Bridgeton, New Jersey, released video this week showing the death of Jerame Reid, 36, who was shot on the night of December 30. He was a passenger in a car that got pulled over for allegedly failing to stop at a stop sign. The dashcam video shows what happened next. Officer Braheme Days approaches the passenger side door. He asks how the two men inside the car are doing and identifies himself. The conversation is friendly. Days asks to see a driver's license. Suddenly, he steps back from the vehicle and pulls his weapon. Days shouts over and over: ""Show me your hands! ... Don't you f****** move!"" He yells at his partner, Roger Worley: ""Get 'em out the car, Rog. We got a gun in this glove compartment."" Days reaches into the car and removes what appears to be a silver handgun. The shouting continues. ""I'll telling you, I'm going to shoot you! You're going to be f****** dead!"" screams the officer. ""You reach for something you're going to be f****** dead."" And later: ""He's reaching! He's reaching!"" Despite the officer's entreaties, Reid appears to push his way out of the passenger side door. He gets out of the car with his hands in front of him. Both Days and Worley open fire. Reid drops to the ground. The vehicle's other occupant did not appear to be injured. He got out of the car, lay on the ground and was handcuffed. A December statement from the local prosecutor's office did not identify the driver. It said a handgun was revealed and recovered during the stop. Both officers have been placed on administrative leave, and an investigation into the use of deadly force is ongoing, the statement said. Bridgeton Police Capt. Michael Gaimari described Days and Worley as ""very good officers"" responsible for ""a lot of key arrests."" Another statement released this week said: ""The Cumberland County Prosecutor's Office is committed to conducting a thorough, fair and impartial investigation into the police-involved shooting death of Jerame Reid. Requests for the release of additional information while the confidential investigation is ongoing stand in the way of completing a neutral, objective and independent evaluation of the facts. This observation is not unique to this matter."" Gaimari said Days was one of four officers who arrested Reid last August on charges that included resisting arrest, drug possession, intent to distribute and failure to appear. The disposition of the case was not immediately known. In addition, Reid had been arrested six times by Bridgeton police since 2009 on charges of making terroristic threats, harassment, burglary, obstruction, marijuana possession and stalking, according to police records. The disposition of each case is unknown. Police and court records list Reid's first name as Jerome, but the prosecutor's office listed it as Jerame. In New Jersey, some local leaders are demanding that the state take over the investigation. ""Jerome put his hand ups,"" said Walter Hudson, chairman and founder of the National Awareness Alliance. ""You can see Jerome's hands are clearly up."" The Police Department reportedly released the video after a public records request was made by the South Jersey Times. Does video of police tell the whole truth? CNN's Ray Sanchez and Haimy Assefa contributed to this report.","A New Jersey police officer shoots and kills a passenger in a car .

Victim: Ruth Christopher died after she was involved in an accident with a Domino's delivery driver . A jury has awarded $32 million to the family of a Southeast Texas couple involved in a deadly crash with a Domino’s Pizza delivery driver. The Jefferson County jury concluded the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based chain was partially responsible for the death of 65-year-old Ruth Christopher. A Domino’s delivery driver lost control of his car while delivering a pizza in Beaumont in 2012 and hit a vehicle carrying Ruth and and her husband Devavaram Christopher. Ruth Christopher died the next day; her husband, now 70, was injured severely. The accident was blamed on defective, worn tires on the delivery vehicle. The driver was also cited for speeding. Jurors concluded on Tuesday that Domino’s was partly responsible by not enforcing a policy that drivers' vehicles be inspected. A Domino’s spokesman says the company plans to appeal. Tim McIntyre, vice president of communications for the Ann Arbor-based Domino's, said the company offered its condolences for the 'terrible accident'. But he said it was difficult to comprehend 'that a corporation is responsible for whether an independent franchise employee is driving on bald tires'. 'The employee in question did not work for us; he worked for an established independent franchise operation. 'Franchisors do not control the day-to-day operations of franchisees, especially to that minute level of detail. We are saddened by this tragedy, but do intend to appeal the decision.'

"(CNN) -- The crew of an Italian ship seized by pirates on Monday was freed Tuesday thanks to an operation by U.S. and British troops working with the Italian military, the Italian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday. Eleven pirates who hijacked the Montecristo surrendered to the troops operating under NATO's Operation Ocean Shield, the ministry said in a statement. All crew members are safe, the ministry said. They barricaded themselves in the engine room after throwing a message overboard in a bottle and putting up a cardboard sign to let rescuers know where they were. They were able to retain control of the ship's steering, even though the pirates destroyed the ship's communications equipment, a NATO officer said. The USS De Wert was the first ship to arrive on the scene, and monitored the hijacked vessel until the British ship HMS Fort Victoria arrived with a boarding team, Lt. Gwenn Laine of NATO told CNN. The pirates threw their weapons into the sea as the boarding team closed in, and stood on deck to surrender once they boarded, Laine said. He praised the crew for following ""best maritime practices,"" saying that by barricading themselves in a safe place they probably avoided violence. The pirates are in NATO custody, said Laine, who works with the alliance's Operation Ocean Shield. The captain sent a message Monday indicating that the vessel had been attacked by a ship with five armed people on board, the D'Alesio Group said in a statement. The captain immediately activated security procedures, the statement said. The ship was about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) east of the Somali coast at the time. The crew includes 23 people from Italy, Ukraine, and India, the D'Alesio Group said. Their rescue came shortly after Italy said it would start putting military guards on ships traversing the pirate-infested waters off the coast of Somalia . Defense Minister Ignazio La Russa is signing an agreement Tuesday with the confederation of Italian shipowners to put military guards on board vessels in the area of the Indian Ocean at risk from Somali pirates, his ministry told CNN. Both NATO and the European Union have naval missions dedicated to protecting ships in the region, but hijackings remain common. As of late September there were some 400 hostages held by Somali pirates, according to the International Maritime Bureau. There have been 24 successful hijackings this year to date and 194 incidents. The number of incidents is up from last year, but the number of successful hijackings down, according to the IMB.

Britax has revealed the Xtensafix car seat may be exchanged after it failed tests carried out by experts at Which? Britax has withdrawn its latest hi-tech child car seat – the Xtensafix – amid safety fears. The hi-tech design, which costs £216, failed tests carried out by experts at the consumer group Which? The manufacturer insists the product, designed for children from the age of nine months to the point they are big enough for the normal seat, meets all industry standards. However, it has decided to offer an exchange following a series of stringent tests carried out by consumer groups. The Xtensafix was one of 16 child car seats tested by ADAC, the German automotive club, for European consumer organisations including Which? The seat was marketed as being a safety advance in that it includes a five point safety harness, likened to those used by racing drivers. It also includes padded wings to keep a child secure, a moveable head rest and pads across the chest straps to limit any injury during an impact. Which? child car seat researcher, Victoria Pearson. said: ‘The Xtensafix looked like an exciting new product that offered a long useful life span and the possibility to use a five-point harness for longer - which was good news for parents with heavier toddlers. ‘But it did not meet all of our high expectations when we got it to our test lab and scored so poorly in one test that we had to rate it as a Don't Buy.’ The Xtensafix can be used for children between 9-36kg in four different modes, all of which were tested in simulated crash tests. Which found ‘severe weaknesses in frontal impact safety’ where the adult seatbelt – rather than the five point harness - was used for larger children. In simple terms, a child was in danger of being thrown forward and injuring themselves in a crash. Miss Pearson said: ‘Our tests are more stringent than the legal standard and Britax was not obliged to withdraw the Xtensafix from sale. ‘So we are really pleased that Britax has taken these disappointing results seriously and has acted fast to remove the Xtensafix from sale and offered to refund or replace seats that have already been sold.’ Manufacturers Britax said the hi-tech car seat, for children aged from nine months, meets all industry legal standards (stock image) Which? tests around 35 new child car seats each year and says its independent crash tests are more stringent that the United Nations regulation ECE R44 that car seats must comply with to be sold in the EU. Its front crash test is carried out at a higher speed than ECE R44 - about 40mph instead of 30mph -and it includes a side impact crash test, which ECE R44 does not require. Child car seats are tested in a real car body, not on a sledge with a car bench seat fixed to it, so the position of the seat belt anchorage points and car seat characteristics are more realistic. Britax said: ‘In the test results, the Xtensafix received sufficient scores in all usage modes with the seat's integrated 5-point harness. However, it received an ‘insufficient’ score from ADAC in usage modes with the vehicle's adult seat belt. ‘Parents should rest assured, that the Xtensafix has been fully tested, approved and certified in accordance with the legal standards applicable in the European Union (ECE R44/04) and has . passed all legally required safety and other tests in all usage modes. ADAC's opinions and ratings do not change this position. ‘However, simply meeting legal standards is not what Britax is all about and is not what our brand represents. We make premium products, work to very high standards and expect our products to deliver best-in-class performance in the most demanding tests. ‘We have, therefore, taken the decision to stop actively manufacturing and selling the Xtensafix in its current form.’ Britax is offering a full refund or a redeemable store voucher equal to the purchase price paid for parents who return their Xtensafix to the store they bought it from.","The Xtensafix, priced at £216, failed tests carried out by experts at Which?

"A local strolling on a beach in Cape Town has snapped terrifying photos of a deadly Cape cobra in the shallows. The snake, which was estimated to be up to 1.8m in length was spotted on Hout Bay beach, make its way along the sand to the water. Photos have since been shared on social networking sites, with Hout Bay resident Jeffery Rinks among those who managed to capture the snake on camera. A combination of deadly snake and sharks could make Hout Bay the world's most dangerous beach . The snake was trapped between photographer and the shark-infested water . Speaking to South African radio station 567 CapeTalk, snake and reptile expert Shaun Macleod said: 'That's fantastic, that's a beautiful size, they seldom get to that size.' He explained that snakes soak in water when they are about to shed as their skin gets irritated and says it probably ended up in the water on this occasion because the photographer was blocking its escape route. He said: 'So the snake was trying everything it could to move away from the photographer and ended up in the water, it's a fantastic shot. It looks like the guy's having a surf, [it's] fantastic.' Experts explained that the snake would only become dangerous if it is disturbed or people tamper with it and Macleod said 98 per cent of snake bites are self-inflicted. Hout Bay is known for its shark-infested waters and boat tours can be taken by visitors to see seal colonies and other marine life. The photos of the cobra were shared on Twitter, with many expressing their shock and disbelief at the size of the snake, as well as the situation itself. Residents who live on Hout Bay have voiced their worry after the deadly cobra was spotted on the beach . Ina Gouws ‏wrote on Twitter: 'I'd collapse; scared to death,' while Thandile Ntshwanti said: 'This thing about the cobra and the beach in Cape Town, just messed up my holiday plans... Can't be swimming with no cobras. Ayanda Shayi wrote: 'A 2 meter long cobra having a swim in Cape Town Hout Bay... I think we need to review our vacation plan,' and JodieCocker added: 'Just when we thought it was safe to venture onto the beach or into the sea.. BOOM - Cape Cobra of Fear!' Iain Macdonald said: 'This must have been an impressive sight to see, especially the size of this Cape Cobra snake on Hout Bay beach.' Meanwhile residents who live near to where the cobra was spotted have voiced their safety concerns after the release of the pictures. The snake was ushered away from people and dogs by beach-goers throwing sand towards it . Speaking to the Daily Sun Lungisa Benzile said: 'I was shocked when I saw photos of that huge snake crawling on the beach. 'We will avoid the beach. We have had problems with snakes here before.' CapeTalk were contacted by Hout Bay-based Rinks, who told the radio station that along with a friend, they managed to encourage the snake off the sand and under a log until the reptile experts arrived to capture the animal. 'I immediately made sure people kept away from it, put the dog on a leash, and my priority then was to ensure the safety of the snake and the people and dogs that were out. 'I was joined by a woman who quite confidently suggested we try and herd the snake away from the water. 'Between the two of us we threw sand at the snake. Eventually the snake came up to a log and I stayed with (it) for about an hour.'","Snake spotted taking a dip on Hout Bay beach, in Cape Town, South Africa .

"A dethroned Burmese beauty queen has refused to return her $100,000 jewelled tiara until organisers of the pageant apologise for calling her 'a liar and a thief'. May Myat Noe allegedly disappeared with the tiara after she was dethroned as the 2014 Miss Asia Pacific World winner for 'being rude'. But at a press conference today the 18-year-old insisted she had done nothing wrong and denied accepting breast implants free of charge, as claimed by David Kim, the director of media for the South Korea-based pageant. Scroll down for videos . Dethroned beauty queen May Myat Noe, of Burma, has refused to return her $100,000 jewelled tiara until organisers of the pageant apologise for calling her 'a liar and a thief' The 18-year-old insisted she had done nothing wrong when she appeared at a press conference today . Mr Kim had said organisers wanted her to have breast enhancement surgery before they could get her a record deal. He had said the teenager was stripped of her title because she was dishonest and unappreciative - and because she ran off with her bejewelled tiara. Miss Noe however has said that she boarded a plane for Burma without realising she had been dethroned. Mr Kim had said Miss Noe had been a disappointment from the outset. Following her victory, the organisers and sponsors wanted the 5ft 7in pageant winner to change her looks so she could become a singer. Mr Kim said: 'We thought she should be more beautiful ... so as soon as she arrived we sent her to the hospital to operate on her breasts.'

May Myat Noe (right) winner of the 2014 Miss Asia Pacific World, walks with her mother San San Htwe for a press conference while carrying her crown that she allegedly ran away with . Adding that the competition's sponsors paid £6,000 for her breast enhancement, Mr Kim said: 'It's our responsibility. 'If she has no good nose, then maybe, if she likes, we can operate on her nose. If it's breasts, then breasts.' The pageant organisers had said they also paid for a 10-day trip for her and her mother to Seoul, South Korea, but that quickly turned into three months, incurring extra cost. She 'lied' and 'never had respect for the main organisation, the national director, the manager, media or fans who made her the winner,' organisers said in a statement. Burmese model May Myat Noe, 18, was crowned winner of Miss Asia Pacific in May but has been dethroned . Miss Noe's picture has been taken down off the competition's website and it says 'dethroned' next to her name . Miss Noe was given a flight back to Burmese capital Rangoon, but did not show up, with Malaysian news sites reporting that she got on an earlier plane. The pageant organisers have been demanding she hand back the jewel-encrusted Swarovski tiara - worth between £60,000 and £120,000. Mr Kim said: 'Everyone knows she is no longer the queen, but she thinks as long as she keeps this crown she's the winner. She's not.' Her picture has been taken down off the competition's website and it says 'dethroned' next to her name. British model Amy Willerton took part in Miss Asia Pacific in 2011, but chose to leave the competition early . Hla Nu Tun, who initially acted as her unofficial manager, has said Miss Noe and the organisers had disagreed over who should oversee her career. Miss Noe's mother wanted control but so did the organisers, she said. Burma, which only recently emerged from a half-century military rule and self-imposed isolation, started sending contestants to international beauty pageants for the first time in decades in 2012.

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods is no longer officially considered one of golf's top 50 players, ending a streak that extended back 15 years. According to the official World Golf Ranking, the 35-year-old Woods entered the weekend as the sport's 50th best player. But he lost that standing when Louis Oosthuizen finished tied for fifth at this weekend's Dunhill Links Championship in Scotland, earning him a place in the standings and ousting Woods. The rankings are endorsed by Professional Golf Association tours in the United States, Europe, Australia, Asia and elsewhere, according to the World Golf Ranking website. An updated ranking comes out every Monday. The last time Woods was not among the top 50 was on October 13, 1996. Since then, he won 14 major championships -- a distinction used for the Masters, U.S. Open, British Open and PGA championship -- and, for much of the next 778 weeks, ranked as the game's best player. In recent years, Woods has been plagued by the fallout surrounding his infidelity and divorce from his wife as well as numerous injuries. His last tournament win was the Australian Masters in November 2009. His next competition will be this week at the Frys.com Open in Corde Valley, California. Despite his recent slump, American team captain Fred Couples chose Woods as one of his wild card picks for next month's Presidents Cup in Australia.

"(CNN) -- He is a superstar in Arab cinema and has acted alongside Hollywood names such as Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Orlando Bloom in worldwide blockbusters. Now, acclaimed Egyptian movie star Khaled El Nabawy is raring to conquer new heights, starring in gripping drama ""The Citizen,"" his first lead role in a Hollywood film. The movie, released last year, has a story line based on the September 11 attacks in the United States. El Nabawy's character, Ibrahim Jarrah, is a newly arrived immigrant from Lebanon, who finds himself wrongly accused of being involved in the terrorist attacks. ""The guy didn't do anything except he was infatuated by the American dream,"" says El Nabawy of his character in ""The Citizen."" ""This is why he won the green card lottery but [it is] his bad luck that he arrived one day before 9/11 to New York. He loves America and he's educated, he is cultured, he is helpful and it's a great message through 'The Citizen' that gives hope. It talks about the cooperation that can happen instead of creating revenge between each other."" See also: 'Egypt's Brad Pitt' calls for people power in Africa . This is the third time in the Egyptian actor's career that he has landed a role in a major Hollywood production. His two previous outings include a smaller part in Ridley Scott's 2005 epic ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" while in 2010 El Nabawy played an Iraqi scientist in ""Fair Game,"" a thriller based on former CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson's memoir ""Fair Game: My Life As A Spy, My Betrayal By The White House."" ""What's common between the three parts -- 'Kingdom of Heaven,' 'Fair Game' and 'The Citizen' -- is that you try to tell people the truth,"" says El Nabawy. ""Arabs are not terrorists; Arabs are kind people, normal people and you cannot portray Arabs through the 15 people who have done 9/11."" El Nabawy, who was discovered by one of Arab cinema's most celebrated directors, the late Youssef Chahine, says he is determined to accurately portray North Africans and Middle Easterners to the rest of the world. ""Of course it is a responsibility, not only towards Arabs [but] toward the other, toward the Americans, toward the West, because I always believe that we know about the West more than the West knows about us,"" he says. El Nabawy adds: ""I feel that our responsibility is to tell the West the truth about us."" See also: 'Harassment map' empowers Egyptian women . Passionate about his country, El Nabawy was one of the first prominent voices in Egypt to come out in support of the 2011 revolution that resulted in the removal of former president Hosni Mubarak.

"(CNN)  -- The second-highest ranking official in Iraqi President Jalal Talabani's political party resigned Saturday, along with four other high-ranking Kurdish politicians, officials said. Iraqi President Jalal Talabani could be jeopardized by the resignations of five key members of his party. Khosrat Rasul, the vice president of the Kurdistan Regional Government, resigned, along with four other members of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), according to Kurdish lawmakers. Rasul is a battle-scarred veteran of Kurdish rebellions against former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Kurdish members of the Iraqi Parliament say the resignations threaten the delicate balance of power in Iraqi Kurdistan, a semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq. It has been the most stable part of the country since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. ""It looks very serious,"" said Ala Talabani, the president's niece and a PUK member, as well as a member of Parliament. She spoke by phone from the Iraqi Kurdish city of Sulaimaniya, long a stronghold of the PUK. ""It's about corruption,"" Ala Talabani said of the resignations. ""They are asking about the resources and the money. Who is spending it. And who is in charge of the income of the party."" ""It's not good,"" said Mahmoud Othman, a member of the Iraqi Parliament and an independent Kurdish politician. ""The PUK is one of the main two [Kurdish] players,"" he added. ""A problem like this will upset the whole situation."" Iraqi Kurdistan broke free from Baghdad's control after the 1991 Gulf War. Since then, the region has been divided between two rival Kurdish factions, Talabani's PUK and the Kurdistan Democratic Party, led by Massoud Barzani. For several years throughout the 1990s, the groups battled each other in the mountains and valleys of northern Iraq. Those historic divisions faded somewhat following the United States' overthrow of Hussein. For the past five years, the Kurds have worked together in Baghdad to enhance the Kurdish region's position in Iraq. Kurdish politicians deftly took advantage of divisions between Sunni and Shi'a Arab factions. They successfully lobbied to maintain Kurdistan's militia of pesh merga fighters. Demands to expand the Kurdish zone of control and win the right to exploit oil deposits in Kurdish territory have increased tensions between Kurdish and Arab politicians. The resignation of Rasul and his allies threatens the power base of Talabani, the first Kurdish president in Iraqi history. ""If it is not fixed by Talabani by tomorrow, this could change the entire landscape of Kurdish politics,"" said Hiwa Osman, the Iraq country director of the Institute for War and Peace Reporting. Iraq's three northern Kurdish provinces are scheduled to hold regional elections in May. Talabani is expected to travel to Kurdistan to hold emergency meetings with Rasul and his other former comrades-in-arms. This is not the first time the stout Kurdish leader has faced a rebellion from within the ranks of his followers. Kurdish observers say these disputes usually stem from disagreements over money and power.","5 politicians in Kurdish Iraqi President Talabani's PUK party resign .

"The owners of a Yorkshire terrier measuring just five inches tall and seven inches long believe she may be the smallest in the country. Three-year-old Pagan is so small that she nearly died once when the whippet she lives with yawned and caught the terrier's head in her mouth. Owner Brenda Wheeldon, 72, from Hull, says her pet is too small to use a lead on, so she pushes the dog around in a tiny doll's pram. Pagan the Yorkie is so small she travels around her hometown Hull in a pink and leopard-print doll's pram . Mrs Wheeldon said that when she first got Pagan, the dog was so tiny she took her to the vet because she feared she wasn't growing properly. But she says the vet told her the dog, who eats well but weighs less than three pounds, was perfectly healthy, just small. She said the only health problems the dog has suffered cane when the whippet she lives with yawned and got the dog's tiny head stuck in its mouth. Mrs Wheeldon said: 'The vet was really worried and she was almost put down twice but made a miraculous recovery. 'It's amazing that she's still with us and, although we have to be careful with her head, she's back to normal. Pagan, who is smaller than a chihuahua,  has a wardrobe full of tiny, hand-made dog clothes to keep her warm, and has become quite a canine celebrity due to her diminutive size. Not for sale: Pagan's owner Brenda Wheeldon, from Hull, has been offered up to £1,000 for her but said no . Mrs Wheeldon's daughter Paula Windstanley, 47, said: 'You can't take her to a market on a lead because she'd get squashed. She's too small. 'Everyone always wants to take photographs of her and she loves it.' Mrs Wheeldon said Pagan was particularly popular with men, rather than women, and said she has been offered up to £1,000 for the dog. But she's not selling. Write caption here . She said: 'Pagan is such a character and although some Yorkshire terriers are quite snappy, she usually isn't. 'She also loves children and my two great-granddaughters love her.  She likes to lie back and have her tummy tickled and she always runs upstairs to bed. 'People say I should enter her into competitions and maybe I will - I always watch Crufts.' Mrs Wheeldon added: 'I don't believe I have ever seen a dog smaller than Pagan - she could be the smallest in the country.'","The tiny dog weighs less than three pounds and is smaller than chihuahua .

The GP known as Dr Death wants to set up Britain's first suicide 'support group', it emerged today. Dr Michael Irwin, who was given the name after helping people visit a euthanasia clinic, is launching 'Die-alogue' which will share advice on euthanasia, Swiss suicide clinic Dignitas and end-of-life care. Retired Dr Irwin, who lives in Surrey, said he hoped members of the club, which is due to launch next month in Hove, East Sussex, would help each other travel abroad to commit suicide if necessary. Plans: Dr Michael Irwin, who was given the name after helping people visit a euthanasia clinic, is launching 'Die-alogue' which will share advice on euthanasia, Swiss suicide clinic Dignitas and end-of-life care . The 80-year-old doctor said: ‘The topic of rational suicide should be discussed. I want people to provide one another with financial, moral and emotional support. ‘People could support each other by travelling abroad to the Dignitas clinic. Sometimes the person who wants to go to Dignitas has no one to help them. This group would aim to help that.’ Dr Irwin does not advocate suicide in healthy people but believes those who assist people with a terminal illness should not be prosecuted for doing so. The group will also discuss care plans should a person suffer a serious illness, such as locked-in syndrome or a stroke. Dr Irwin said: ‘Some people want to stay alive - they want all the care they can receive - whereas others do not. This group would help people make these decisions while they can.’ Controversial: Around 150 Britons are thought to have died at Dignitas, which exploits liberal Swiss laws . Dr Irwin told how the idea for the group came from the Brighton and Hove Fabian Society, where he gave a talk recently. 'Some people want to stay alive - they want all the care they can receive - whereas others do not. This group would help people make these decisions while they can' Dr Michael Irwin . He has also been in contact with an 83-year-old dementia sufferer who plans to die at Dignitas. The British man would be the first to end his life at the Swiss clinic purely because of dementia. In 2011 Dr Irwin revealed how a 91-year-old from Eastbourne had contacted him about Dignitas. He did not take her to Switzerland but police officers interviewed him, making no arrest. Dr Irwin has been investigated in the past over assisted suicide – an offence carrying a 14-year jail sentence – but has never been arrested. Around 150 Britons are thought to have died at Dignitas, which exploits liberal Swiss laws on assisted dying. A Sussex Police spokesman said: 'The Suicide Act 1961 states that a person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the suicide of another, or an attempt by another to commit suicide, shall be liable to prosecution. We have an obligation to investigate any specific offence that is alleged to us.'","Dr Michael Irwin: 'Die-alogue' group set to be launched in Hove next month .

"By . Jason Groves, Political Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 20:58 EST, 13 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:00 EST, 14 November 2012 . Imposing boardroom quotas for women would be 'patronising' and wrong, Women's Minister Maria Miller said yesterday. In a major speech on women's role in the economy yesterday, Mrs Miller dismissed a drive by the European Commission to impose a minimum 40 per cent quota for women on company boards. She said more still needed to be done on both equal opportunities and pay, but insisted policy would not be driven by 'political correctness'. Removing barriers: Women's Minister Maria Miller has called for greater support in helping women reach their goals rather than imposing quotas . 'It makes no sense to stifle the achievement and aspiration of 50 per cent of our society. 'It is absolutely essential that we maximise the contribution that women can make to our economy. 'Not because of political correctness, but because of economic reality. Now more than ever, we need to remove barriers to the workplace. 'The way to do this is not through special treatment or regulation like the European Commission's quotas idea, which patronises women and undermines the business case. 'It is about removing the barriers to achieving their goals, and so that women are supported all the way from the shop floor to the boardroom.' Sources in Brussels last night said the EU was poised to abandon its controversial quota plans because of opposition from Britain and other countries. Mrs Miller also unveiled a £2 million scheme to boost childcare and help more women find a job. Grants of up to £500 will be available from next April for people setting up a nursery or childminding business. The money will help cover legal and insurance costs, health and safety training and equipment, while advice and mentoring will also be offered. Mrs Miller hopes £2million scheme will boost female entrepreneurs . Mrs Miller said the scheme would create jobs and help reverse a decline in the number of childminders, which has been identified as a barrier for women wanting to return to work. She said: 'The childcare industry is already a major employer of women, and this scheme will provide huge opportunities for female entrepreneurs to start up and run their own businesses. 'This is an injection of cash designed to stimulate the sector in tough times, the new scheme will provide more childcare places but will also help get up to 6,000 new childcare businesses off the ground.

Too many actors are mumbling their way through lines leaving audiences struggling to understand them as they attempt to 'copy American film stars', according to some of the great and good of theatre. Doing away with the clear and enunciated acting style of yesteryear, some  directors and producers actively encourage 'laidback mumbling', as it is more 'truthful', it has been said. But it has infuriated well established and leading theatre figures, including Edward Kemp, the artistic director of Rada and renowned classical actress Imogen Stubbs. Imogen Stubbs as Lady Torrance in 'Orpheus Descending'. But the established theatre actress says too many actors are mumbling their way through lines leaving audiences struggling to understand them . Mr Kemp is concerned that the new style of delivery could mean audiences are driven away from stage productions of the works of Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde, among others, because they are unable to understand them, the Observer reports. Ms Stubbs is concerned that the muttering is an attempt to imitate American film stars. She leveled particular criticism at Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby, saying: 'You're just longing for it to stop and breathe...They were rather garbling their lines.' Mr Kemp said the problem was with 'education'. Ms Stubbs leveled particular criticism at Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby, saying: 'You're just longing for it to stop and breathe...They were rather garbling their lines' He said Rada had had to change its training programme to adapt to teenagers who did not have the 'faintest notion of basic grammar'. He said he had even encountered a first year student who had achieved an English A-level who had no idea what a noun was, and revealed Rada had to do away with a sight-reading test of a Dickens passage from auditions because it was too painful to listen to. He said older and established actors honed their deliver through the use of pitch, intonation and tempo -  whereas today's actors relied on volume. While Ms Stubbs said that others are terrified of being caught sounding 'like an old-fashioned actor'. Rada is rethinking its voice training as it gets ready to launch its first public festival, which will be held from 29 June until 6 July .","Some directors actively encourage 'laidback mumbling', as it's more 'truthful'

"(CNN)  -- Accused enemy combatant Ali al-Marri was served with an arrest warrant Tuesday and transferred out of U.S. military custody for the first time since 2003, according to the U.S. Justice Department. Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri was a student at Bradley University in Illinois when he was arrested in 2001. Al-Marri's initial court appearance is scheduled for Tuesday. Defense Secretary Robert Gates released the Qatari man to the U.S. Marshals Service in preparation for the hearing. On Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the Obama administration's request to dismiss al-Marri's challenge of the president's unilateral authority to detain him indefinitely and without charges. The high court ruled that al-Marri's case was rendered moot by a decision to indict him on federal conspiracy charges. The court's ruling means there is no resolution of the larger constitutional issue of the president's power to detain people accused of terrorism and other crimes in the United States. The decision by the Obama administration to criminally charge al-Marri after he spent seven years in custody -- more than five years in virtual isolation in a Navy brig in Charleston, South Carolina -- is the latest twist in the ongoing legal saga of the only remaining ""enemy combatant"" held in the United States. Al-Marri had been accused of being an al Qaeda ""sleeper agent,"" but until the indictment had never been charged with a criminal or terrorism-related offense. The 43-year-old man will be sent at some point to Peoria, Illinois, to face a criminal trial. President Obama last month ordered a prompt and thorough review of the ""factual and legal basis"" for the continued detention of al-Marri. He subsequently issued a presidential memorandum ordering Gates to facilitate al-Marri's transfer, saying it was ""in the interest of the United States."" Since his initial arrest on credit card fraud charges in December 2001, al-Marri -- a legal resident of the United States -- had remained in ""virtual isolation in the brig,"" his attorneys said. They were suing the government to improve his jail conditions and were challenging the constitutionality of his detention. The Pentagon asserts al-Marri had trained at a terror camp in Afghanistan, met al Qaeda leaders Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and ""volunteered for a martyr mission,"" according to a government filing with the Supreme Court.","Ali al-Marri due to appear in court on Tuesday; he's charged with conspiracy .

"TOKYO, Japan (Reuters) -- Ordered to sacrifice themselves for the nation by crashing their planes into U.S. warships as Japan vainly battled to stave off invasion in the final months of World War Two, some young pilots instead returned alive. Young pilots from the Japanese Royal Navy drink cups of sake before their kamikaze suicidal attack mission. As a documentary released in Japan on Saturday shows, not all the young men trained for the suicide missions that struck terror into U.S. servicemen faced their almost certain death gladly. ""I wanted to live,"" Kazuo Nakajima, one of the now elderly 'failed cherry blossoms' tells the filmmakers with an embarrassed laugh. ""I didn't want to die."" Japanese-American director Risa Morimoto sought out former kamikaze after discovering her much-loved uncle had been among those prepared to carry out what were called ""special attacks."" Instead of finding the fanatics she had expected, she met a group of gentle, elderly men who confessed their mixed emotions about the past, she says on the film's Web site. One veteran even criticized the emperor, treated as a living god until Japan's defeat, for failing to surrender sooner. The film, ""Wings of Defeat,"" has already been shown to some surviving crewmen of the U.S.S. Drexler, a destroyer sunk by kamikaze near the end of the war. ""They said, 'We were told we were killing madmen. We were lied to,'"" producer Linda Hoaglund told a recent news conference. She and Morimoto have arranged for two 81-year-old U.S. survivors to meet some of the former kamikaze in Japan next week. The film struck a chord with one elderly Japanese man who said he trained in the same suicide unit as one of the pilots in the documentary. ""It was exactly like that. We thought we were fighting and giving our lives for our families and our comrades,"" said Masaaki Kobayashi, 79, after watching the film with a group of his former comrades. ""As soldiers, that was the only thing we could do."" The film's release coincides with controversy over efforts by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other conservatives to shed what they consider a masochistic attitude to Japan's wartime past. Last month, lawmakers from the southern island of Okinawa -- site of a bloody 1945 battle that killed some 200,000 civilians and soldiers -- blasted the government for deciding to tone down school textbook references to soldiers ordering civilians to commit suicide rather than surrender to U.S. personnel in the war. Abe also drew criticism when he denied that the military or government had hauled Asian women away to serve as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers before and during the war, although he has said he stands by a government apology to the women who suffered. The documentary is being shown two months after a feature film on the kamikaze penned by Tokyo's nationalist governor Shintaro Ishihara, celebrating the young kamikaze as heroes. Many Japanese say wartime reality should be taught to a younger generation too young to remember. ""We shouldn't beautify it, but we shouldn't forget it either,"" said a 34-year-old system engineer who watched the film. Vice-Admiral Takejiro Onishi conceived of the the desperate kamikaze strategy when Japan was on the verge of losing the Philippines to U.S. forces. The first attack took place off the coast of the island of Leyte in the Philippines in 1944 and its success inspired Onishi to recruit more young men for suicide missions. Roughly 4,000 kamikaze pilots died and 34 U.S. ships were sunk in the last few months of the war, according to the filmmakers. ""They thought they were doing it for their country, but if you think about it now, they never should have adopted that strategy,"" said one 82-year-old woman, who served as a nurse during the war and cried as she watched the film.

"The Football Association is to start the search for a new top executive after general secretary Alex Horne announced he is to leave the organisation at the end of January. Horne, 42, has decided to look for a new role after overseeing a number of significant projects including the new Wembley Stadium, the national football centre at St George's Park, and securing the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020. Horne, who took up his current post in 2010, told Press Association Sport: 'After 11 fantastic years I have decided to look for a change of direction and I will be leaving the FA at the end of January.' FA general secretary Alex Horne will leave his position in January after 11 years with the organisation . There is likely to be hot demand to be his successor - FA accounts revealed that his total annual salary package was £528,000. Horne joined the FA in 2004 as finance director and, in 2006, was appointed Wembley Stadium's managing director before becoming the FA's chief operating officer in July 2008. He has also been a member of UEFA's competitions committee where he played a significant role in drawing up plans for staging the Euro 2020 tournament, which is being played in 13 countries across Europe. Horne was a leading figure in the development of the impressive St George's Park National Football Centre . St George's Park was opened by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on October 9, 2012 . Roy Hodgson's England senior team trained there during the recent international break .

The United States -- the world's richest nation -- ranked 16th among 97 countries, while Britain was placed 21st.

"The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both hit all-time highs today as investors gave their stamp of approval to the Republican takeover of the US Senate. The Down was up 100.69 points, 0.6percent, and closed at a record 17,484.53. The S&P was also up 0.6percent and closed at a record 2023.57. Energy companies, which have suffered massive losses thanks to cheap oil, led the rally over hopes that the new GOP majority will lead to approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada and the easing of environmental regulations, which business say have become stricter and more cumbersome under President Barack Obama's administration. The president had blocked construction of the Keystone XL pipeline over environmental concerns, but will now face increasing pressure to approve the project. Record highs: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (blue) and the S&P 500 (orange) both hit new highs the day after Republicans took over the Senate . The S&P energy index was the only one of ten primary S&P 500 sectors to be negative for the year, though it rose 1.6percent Tuesday as the strongest group of the day. Equities rose on relief that election results were clear, with the upcoming Senate majority party not in doubt. Investors had been concerned that some close races would be forced into run-offs, an outcome that could have led to weeks of delay in knowing which party would control Congress's upper chamber. 'It had looked like some of the races would be very close and that we might not know who controlled the Senate, but in the end the results were pretty decisive,' said John Carey, portfolio manager at Pioneer Investment Management in Boston. 'That's good news for the industries that had been subject to regulatory issues.' Business is hoping that the new Republican majority could also lead to deals on immigration reform, a reform of the tax code that would cut rates while limiting deductions and reducing red tape that advocates say has piled up since Obama took office.

"Gordon Ramsay faces a £10.8million bill for rent over the next 17 years after losing a High Court battle over one of his London restaurants. The celebrity chef will have to find a further £1.6million in legal fees and outstanding rental payments for the gastropub at the centre of the row. Ramsay’s personal ‘kitchen nightmare’ stems from a bitter dispute with his estranged father-in-law Christopher Hutcheson, who was chief executive of his businesses until he was forced out in 2010. Scroll down for video . Hearing: Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has lost his High Court battle over being held personally liable for the rent on a London pub he bought. He's pictured with wife Tana after giving evidence . Ramsay, 48, accused Hutcheson of using a ‘ghost writer’ machine to put his signature – without his consent – on a 25-year contract for the York and Albany pub near Regent’s Park in north London. Such machines are often used by authors, celebrities and even royalty to sign books, papers and photographs automatically. But Chancery Division judge Mr Justice Morgan yesterday poured scorn on Ramsay’s claim that he had been duped over the agreement to guarantee the pub’s £640,000 annual rent. The superchef accused his father-in-law, Mr Hutcheson (pictured), of forging his signature . In a scathing judgment, Mr Justice Morgan dismissed as ‘entirely implausible’ Ramsay’s assertion that he did not know the full extent of the use of the signature machine. He added: ‘Accordingly, I find that Mr Ramsay knew, long before the entry into the agreement for lease and the lease of the [York & Albany] premises, that the machine was routinely used to place his signature on legal documents. ‘I do not accept his evidence to the contrary. 'I find that when Mr Hutcheson committed Mr Ramsay to the guarantee in the lease of the premises, Mr Hutcheson was acting within the wide general authority conferred on him by Mr Ramsay at all times until Mr Hutcheson’s dismissal in October 2010. ‘Mr Ramsay may now regret the transaction in relation to the premises. 'He may particularly regret his involvement as a guarantor. 'He may consider that Mr Hutcheson did a bad deal. ‘However, on any finding, he is not able to say that Mr Hutcheson exceeded his authority in any respect. ' Mr Ramsay – acting through his agent Mr Hutcheson – is bound by the guarantee in the lease of the premises.’ At the time of the deal in 2007 Mr Hutcheson was very much at the helm of Gordon Ramsay Holdings. He left in 2010 after an acrimonious split with the chef who accused him of plundering £1million from his firm. Last year actor and film director Gary Love – who owns the York and Albany premises – had described the chef’s High Court challenge as an ‘absurd’ attempt to wriggle out of his rental commitments. Ramsay’s businesses won a bidding war to secure the 160-year-old building in the exclusive Regent’s Park area. The chef – who has starred in a number of TV food programmes including Hell’s Kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares – has since turned the historic pub into an upmarket restaurant, bar and hotel. When giving evidence at the court last November Ramsay’s wife Tana claimed both her father and brother Adam had been ‘systematically defrauding’ her celebrity husband. She also told how she remembered the ‘shock on Gordon’s face’ when the couple’s solicitor told them that the lease for the York & Albany included a personal guarantee from him for 25 years. The chef can still ask the Court of Appeal to hear his case – a path which sources close to Ramsay say he may be considering. His legal bill is estimated at around £750,000 while Mr Love is now expected to claim around £600,000 in outstanding rent. In addition, the judge ordered him to make an interim payment to Mr Love of £250,000 within 28 days. The chef’s personal fortune is understood to be around £80million. Last night Ramsay’s spokesman said: ‘We are obviously disappointed but do not regret bringing this issue to court. We are now reviewing the options available to us.’ Dispute: Mr Ramsay claimed that a ghost writer machine was used to forge his signature on the lease for the York & Albany pub (pictured), near Regent's Park .","Gordon Ramsay disputed being liable for rent on London pub he bought .

"Britain has wasted £250,000 of its aid budget trying to bring green electricity to a community of 55 people in the South Pacific. The £1.7million scheme was scrapped after Australian contractors pocketed huge amounts of cash without building any wind turbines on the islands made famous by the Mutiny on the Bounty. A report from the Department for International Development (DfID) admitted officials had failed to ‘rigorously manage’ the Pitcairn Islands’ eco project. Wasted energy: Britain has wasted £250,000 of its aid budget trying to bring green electricity the Pitcairn islands . Population: There are only around 55 people on the islands, making the original scheme cost the equivalent of £31,000 per head . By the time the scheme was abandoned it had slipped three years behind schedule and doubled in initial costs. The UK first took responsibility for the remote volcanic islands after they were inhabited by mutinous sailors from the crew of the Bounty in 1789. Led by Fletcher Christian, they settled there to escape the hangman’s noose after staging a rebellion against Captain William Bligh. All of the rocky outcrop’s inhabitants can trace their roots back to members of the crew of the Bounty. Two years ago the Mail revealed that the . overseas territory received £2.4million a year from British taxpayers – . more than £43,000 per person every year. Mutiny: English sailor Fletcher Christian led the mutiny against Captain William Bligh on HMS Bounty in 1789 . Now, documents reveal £250,000 of the UK’s aid budget has been wasted trying to bring wind power to the descendants of the ship’s mutinous crew. During the fiasco the UK taxpayer ended up having to foot the bill for chartering a ship to take equipment to the islands. But the charter had to be cancelled because the shipment was not ready to transport. Eventually officials from DfID decided to abandon the scheme. Experts are now trying to convince them that a solar-powered generator would be a better option. Critics have questioned why the islands need such an expensive green electricity system in the first place. There are only around 55 people living there – so the original scheme cost the equivalent of £31,000 per head. Now, if DfID gives the green light to the new solar-powered generator, the total cost of the island’s electricity supply will be even higher than the estimated bill for the original project. Aid bosses say the Government has a duty to spend cash on the island, as it is still a British Overseas Territory. Overseas Territories take priority from the aid budget under laws set down in the UN Charter. But the Government has been roundly criticised for ring-fencing the UK’s aid spending in a time of austerity. Foreign aid is one of the few departments not to have faced a cut in funding. A report into the defunct scheme explains: ‘The contractors engaged in 2007 completed the first stages of the project. ‘However, due to continual late . submission dates of key deliverables and escalating costs, which more . than doubled, the time frame stretched by three years.’ Scrapped: The £1.7million scheme was axed after Australian contractors pocketed huge amounts of cash without building any wind turbines, such as these in West Yorkshire (file picture) A DfID spokesman said: ‘Where contracts are not good value for money and are not being properly delivered, we will take action to protect taxpayer money. ‘The UK Government will be working with the Pitcairn Island government in order to assess the current and future energy needs, including green options such as solar power.’ But Robert Oxley, from the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It’s frankly typical of DfID to waste so much taxpayers’ money on a project that delivers so little. ‘One of the consequences of spending up to an arbitrary aid target is that there is little incentive for officials to deliver value for taxpayers’ money. No one has been held to account for the repeated blunders over this project.’","Aid wasted trying to bring green electricity to community of 55 people .

"British commuters are subsidising foreign railways to the tune of tens of millions of pounds a year, campaigners claimed yesterday. State-owned operators in Germany, France and the Netherlands are said to transfer home their profits from UK rail services, helped by taxpayer subsidies and higher fares than in their own countries. Christian Wolmar, an industry expert, said successive UK governments had invited in ‘European wolves’ who were ‘chomping away at the carcass of our railway system’. State-owned operators in Germany, France and the Netherlands are said to transfer home their profits from UK rail services, helped by taxpayer subsidies and higher fares than in their own countries . He said Britain should instead copy the foreign firms by profiting from running trains on the Continent. ‘Why should these companies be making a profit out of our railways that is then exported to help their railways?’ he said. ‘It is clear they operate in their own national interest, and that is to be expected. British Rail in its last years was pretty efficient and pretty well run, and had a very good generation of managers. ‘If we had kept it, we would be out there chomping up bits of French or Italian or German railways, rather than the other way around.’ Germany’s Deutsche Bahn made a pre-tax profit of £697 million in 2012-13, boosted by British arm Arriva . Mr Wolmar pointed out that British commuters generally paid higher fares than counterparts in Europe, with commuters here facing an inflation-busting rise of up to 2.5 per cent from tomorrow. Some season tickets now cost more than £5,000. Some season tickets now cost more than £5,000 . Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said: ‘Hard-pressed British commuters are subsidising the rest of Europe which has wisely decided to keep publicly owned railways. 'This is the economics of the madhouse.’ British taxpayers paid £2.5 billion in subsidies for trains operated in part or exclusively by subsidiaries of foreign state railways in 2012-13, official figures show. Germany’s public-owned Deutsche Bahn made a pre-tax profit of £697 million in 2012-13 – a figure boosted by British arm Arriva. Its franchises received £861 million in UK subsidies over the same period. Berlin’s transport ministry has stated: ‘We’re skimming profit from the entire Deutsche Bahn and ensuring that it is anchored in our budget. British commuters generally pay higher fares than in Europe, with commuters here facing an inflation-busting rise of up to 2.5 per cent from tomorrow . 'That way we can make sure it is invested in the rail network here in Germany.’ But an Arriva spokesman said: ‘No dividend has been paid by Arriva to its parent company Deutsche Bahn. 'Over that time, all profits generated by Arriva have been reinvested across the Arriva Group.’ Keolis – 70 per cent owned by French state rail firm SNCF – runs a series of franchises including London Midland, Thameslink and Great Northern. It paid £37.9 million in dividends to SNCF and its other shareholder, a Canadian pension fund, over the past two years from the profits of its UK operations. Alistair Gordon of Keolis UK said: ‘Like any private sector business part of our earnings after taxation will be returned to shareholders and a portion will be reinvested into our business to fund improvements to our services.’ Dutch state-owned transport firm Abellio runs Abellio Greater Anglia and – with controversial British outsourcing giant Serco – Merseyrail and Northern Rail. Northern Rail has been widely criticised by passengers for its unreliable service and crowded, uncomfortable and outdated trains, which Chancellor George Osborne pledged last month to replace. This franchise alone received £713million in UK subsidies and paid out £36million in dividends in 2012-13. The firm did not respond to a request for comment. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Far from taking money out of the system, these companies are returning billions to the taxpayer and are investing in a host of improvements for passengers, including more seats.’","British commuters subsidising foreign railways with millions a year .

'And besides, can you imaging the great and all-powerful Trump living in Albany and giving up his Apprentice series? The mind boggles.' But Monroe County, N.Y. Republican chairman Bill Reilich told Capital New York on Thursday that Trump had 'spoken to me directly and told me that when he announces his candidacy [for governor], he's prepared to put $50 million in a bank account.' That amount would trump – pun intended – Cuomo's $33 million war chest. 'It takes some effort to amass this. That's occurring, as I understand it, now,' Reilich said. 'As soon as the filming of [The Apprentice] is complete, he's then going to focus toward the May convention.' Trump may have his sights set even higher. Clipping a microphone to his lapel has been a reliable prescription lately for an attack on the Obama White House, and few long-shot presidential candidates can command such a large stage to level his charges. '[Vladimir] Putin has eaten Obama's lunch, and therefore our lunch for a long time,' he said Thursday, complaining about a weak-willed White House that has let Russia run roughshod over parts of the old Soviet Empire. Trump is scheduled to appear at the April 12 New Hampshire Freedom Summit, . an event in the first-in-the-nation primary state that will showcase . more than a half-dozen potential GOP presidential candidates. Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah will . speak, along with former Arkansas governor and Fox News host Mike . Huckabee, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Tennessee Rep. Marsha . Blackburn. His first formal appearance on the . pre-2016 Republican speaking circuit came a week ago at the Conservative . Political Action Conference. But . his message about unemployment and U.S. weakness abroad sputtered . beneath the weight of a headline-inducing gaffe in which he referred to . the 39th U.S. president as 'the late, great Jimmy Carter.' Carter is very much alive. Trump said Thursday on NBC that Republican leaders want him to run against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo 'badly' Trump was on the TODAY show to announce that the June 2014 Miss USA event, which will air on NBC, will be held in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Trump owns the Miss Universe Organization. Miss USA is America's qualifying pageant for that global competition. He called the Pelican State's capital 'a place that really wanted us.' 'We had about 12 places that were fighting for the rights, and we just decided that's sort of the home of pageantry, it's sort of the home of the whole beauty thing. They're terrific people, and they're going to put on a great show.' 'Usually we go to Las Vegas. We never fail in Las Vegas,' he said. 'It's great, but we thought we'd move it.' Trump appeared alongside Miss USA 2013 Erin Brady, who announced that she intended to enter the entertainment industry after her reign is over. He has said he plans to decide whether or not to run for governor by the end of the week.","Trump could face a crowded Republican primary field but would have a huge advantage in name-recognition .

"Jose Mourinho has provided the clearest indication yet that he will recommend Chelsea offer skipper John Terry a new 12-month contract. It is club policy to offer over-30s only one-year deals, and 34-year-old Terry’s existing arrangement expires at the end of the season. The Chelsea captain remains a first-choice member of Mourinho’s squad, forming a formidable partnership with Gary Cahill in central defence. John Terry is set to be handed a new one-year deal by Chelsea . Chelsea’s manager will make his recommendations to the Blues hierarchy regarding Terry’s contractual situation nearer the end of the season. And the Portuguese has given a major hint that Terry will be offered a new deal after claiming the former England captain could play for at least three more years. ‘Every individual is an individual,’ said Mourinho. ‘There are old players at the age of 22. I know some — 22 and old. I know young guys at 36 or 37. John is one of them. I had Javier Zanetti at Inter who was already 37. When the other guys came after a day off from training, he’d run from his home to burn the energy from his day off. I don’t know (how long Terry can play). You never know when. The important thing is that, tomorrow, it’s the next match and he’s in great condition to play.’ Terry is 34 and has been Chelsea debut back in 1998 . John Terry has been part of the Chelsea squad since he was 19 . Mourinho’s second spell in charge at Stamford Bridge has given Terry a new lease of life when it looked as if his Blues career was fizzling out under Rafa Benitez. And the Special One, who also insisted Eden Hazard’s new contract will be settled soon, provided a simple explanation. ‘Our training methodology helps. The way he is taking care of himself is very important too,’ Mourinho said, ‘but the most important thing of everything is to be happy. I read a famous neurologist who said, “We docs always say do some exercise, eat properly, be careful with salt, be careful with this protein, but we forget to tell people the most important thing: be happy.” ‘John had a period here of so many doubts, question marks. Is he still the same player? Can he play at this level? Is he fit? Will he play or be in the stands? ‘Then, suddenly, the happiness arrives and look at him. It’s been a process. When I arrived we played a European Super Cup and he was not playing. At that moment, he was happy but he was not ready for the high level. So it was also a process. But the reality is he played so well last season and this season, too.’ Jose Mourinho is looking for Chelsea to return to winning ways after defeat at Newcastle last week . Meanwhile, Belgium keeper Thibaut Courtois has been ruled out of today’s home match with Hull City with a minor leg injury, paving the way for Petr Cech to make his first Premier League start this season. Insisting that Cech will not be leaving next month, Mourinho said: ‘He doesn’t need to prove anything to me, the club, his team-mates, to supporters. It’s comfortable to know our goalkeeper tomorrow is Petr Cech.’","John Terry made his Chelsea debut back in 1998 .

"James Anderson has dismissed Kevin Pietersen's suggestion that the sacked batsman could play for England again in future should there be changes among the ECB hierarchy. Pietersen's England career has looked over ever since he was sacked following the Ashes debacle last winter, and relations have turned even uglier following the batsman's bitter criticism of the national set-up in his recently released autobiography. But the South Africa-born star - the top runscorer in England's history - has suggested he still wants to play international cricket and could do so should Giles Clarke be replaced as chairman of the ECB. Kevin Pietersen has made a series of damaging claims about England in his recent autobiography . Pietersen's England career reached the end of the road after the sad Ashes whitewash last winter . Anderson, however, poured cold water on that idea. 'I can’t really see a way back after what’s been said,' said England's all-time leading wicket-taker, who was a team-mate of Pietersen's throughout the highly successful period under Andy Flower's leadership, which included three Ashes triumphs and lifting the Twenty20 World Cup. Pietersen has felt aggrieved at the way his international career appears to have ended and used his book, KP: The Autobiography, to heavily criticise the ECB, former boss Flower and some of his former team-mates, most notably Matt Prior. 'It’s been an interesting week or so. It’s sad that all the stuff that’s come out has been about a really successful period of cricket,' said Anderson. 'I loved every minute of that. It’s a shame that this overshadows it. 'He was such an amazing player, one of the best, if not the best batsmen we’ve ever had.' Pietersen alleged that there was a 'bullying' culture in the England dressing room, in which the bowlers forced fielders to apologise for mistakes made and players were afraid to stand up for themselves. James Anderson (centre) celebrates a wicket with Pietersen in happier times for England . Prior, Graeme Swann and Stuart Broad were cited as being the ringleaders of a powerful clique in the dressing room, which Pietersen said made for a fractious team atmosphere. Again, however, Anderson gave Pietersen's claims short shrift. 'The dressing room was a really nice play to be,' he said. 'When you’re in a winning successful dressing room, everyone enjoys being there.' 'What I remember of the dominance of those three was that they chose what music went on the ipod.' Jimmy Anderson was speaking ahead of his appearance on The Clare Balding Show which airs Thursday 16th October at 10:15pm on BT Sport 1.","Kevin Pietersen has claimed he could play for England again one day .

"A Minnesota woman has pleaded guilty to killing her fiance by tying him to an SUV and dragging him along a country road until he died. Jessica Kilde, 33, will be sentenced for second-degree intentional murder in Becker County March 16. Prosecutors say the mother of one from Ogema lashed Richard Baity, 41, to the vehicle using a strap around his neck last August and dragged him down the driveway and onto the road. Guilty: Jessica Kilde, 33, of Minnesota, will be sentenced for second-degree intentional murder in the August killing of 41-year-old Richard Baity . Confession: Kilde (left) has pleaded guilty to killing her fiance (right) by tying him to an SUV and dragging him along a country road until he died . His body was found about 50 yards from his driveway in Maple Grove Township. A criminal complaint says Kilde told authorities she and Baity had a disagreement that night, but that it was nothing serious. Authorities say the two had been drinking and smoking methamphetamine earlier in the day. According to prosecutors, at around 10.30pm on August 15, sheriff's deputies responded to a 911 call about a possible fatality and came upon Richard Baity's lifeless body along East 370th Street in Maple Grove Township, reported the Minneapolis Star Tribune. Evidence at the crime scene suggested that the 41-year-old man had been dragged: there were fresh marks on his neck and a broken strap was lying nearby. Jessica Kilde was then seen behind the wheel of a Ford Sport Trac SUV, which still had a piece of a strap tied to the top of the door frame on the rear passenger side that matched the strap found near Baity's body. An autopsy report by the Ramsey County Medical Examiner’s Office stated that Baity died of ‘multiple traumatic injuries’ and ruled the death a homicide. Police said Kilde and Baity had been drinking and smoking methamphetamine before the fatal incident . Kilde, who according to her Facebook page at one time worked as a personal care assistant, had been engaged to Baity and the two were supposed to get married less than three weeks before his death. The 33-year-old's Facebook wall is filled with posts expressing her love for her husband-to-be. In December, months after Baity's death, his brother Kevin wrote an angry comment on Kilde’s social media page in reaction to an old post announcing their upcoming nuptials. ‘What she did not say is she is going to KILL him,’ Kevin Baity wrote. According to Detroit Lakes Online, Kilde has a long criminal history, which includes a dozen prior arrests on charges ranging from check forgery and domestic assault to DWI and car theft.","Jessica Kilde, 33, of Minnesota, will be sentenced for second-degree intentional murder in the August killing of 41-year-old Richard Baity .

"By . John Hall . A family who claim their five-year-old son developed facial paralysis after doctors dropped him seconds after birth are attempting to raise money for surgery that will allow him to smile. Maddox Perales, from Marietta in Georgia, suffers from Moebius Syndrome - an extremely rare form of facial paralysis that is caused either by a genetic defect or direct trauma. Now that Maddox is preparing to start school, his parents Charlie Perales and Danielle Templer are keen to ensure their otherwise hugely sociable son is able to make friends, so they are hoping to raise $100,000 to pay for him to have facial reanimation surgery. Unable to smile: Maddox Perales, from Marietta in Georgia, suffers from Moebius Syndrome - an extremely rare form of facial paralysis that affects just one in a million babies . Adorable: Instead of expressing emotion using his facial muscles, Maddox uses his hands to force his mouth into a smile - a heartbreaking move that is making his parents concerned about making friends at school . Mr Perales, a military veteran who has served twice in Iraq and once in Afghanistan, says his son was born perfectly healthy but was dropped by a doctor just minutes later. This, he claims, is what led to Maddox developing Moebius Syndrome - a highly unusual form of facial paralysis that affects one in a million children and is caused either by genetics or injury. 'I've been through a lot in the military... It was a lot different feeling when you see your son falling, Mr Perales told USA Today. '[The doctor] told us pretty much that he'd never be able to smile,' Ms Templer added. 'He would never be able to frown, and he wouldn't blink. I remember my therapist saying, 'Don't treat him like he's different.' So I treat him like there's nothing wrong,' she said. Cause: Maddox's father says his son was born perfectly healthy but was dropped by a doctor just minutes later. This, he claims, is what led to Maddox developing Moebius Syndrome . For the most part the disorder does not impact of Maddox's life and he is a hugely bubbly character - happily chatting to his parents, rarely sitting still and always keen to re-watch the DVD of his favourite animated film, Frozen. It is only when Maddox wants to express joy that it becomes obvious he is not like other young boys. Instead of expressing emotion using his facial muscles, Maddox uses his hands to force his mouth into a smile - a heartbreaking move that is making his parents concerned for his immediate future. Later this year Maddox will start school, where he will need to make friends by himself - something his mother and father are worried he will struggle to do with a face unable to convey friendliness. Normal boy: For the most part the disorder does not impact of Maddox's life and he is a hugely bubbly character - happily chatting to his parents and younger brother and always keen to re-watch his favourite film, Frozen . As a result, Mr Perales and Ms Templer have set up a GoFundMe page in the hope of raising $100,000 for Maddox to have facial reanimation surgery. The operation will repair damage to the boy's facial muscles and nerves and will eventually give him his smile back, Ms Templer says. 'Everyone deserves a smile and so I won't stop until my son has a smile on his face too,' she added. 'It's not the desire to make him smile,' Maddox's father said. 'Smiling is just something we do on the outside. It's the desire for him to be happy.'","Maddox Perales, five, suffers from an extremely rare form of facial paralysis .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . This could be the car used by the unknown killer of nightclubber Melanie Hall who was brutally murdered 17 years ago, police revealed today. Melanie, then 25, disappeared on a night out in Bath, Somerset, in June 1996. Her remains, dumped beside a slip road on the M5, were not found until 13 years later. The hospital worker had been battered around the head and her body was wrapped in black bin bags and bound with blue rope. Detectives investigating the murder of Melanie Hall believe this car may be linked to the murder . The car - registration C752 CYE - disappeared from official records around the time of Miss Hall's death . Today, police released this photo of a white VW Golf GTi hardtop that disappeared from official records shortly after Melanie vanished. The vehicle - registration C752 CYE - was last known to be registered on August 7, 1996. Police say they do not know what happened to it since - and are appealing for anyone with information about it. They are particularly interested in sightings around the Bath area at the time Melanie disappeared. They also say the car was linked to the Pentwyn area of Cardiff around the time. The latest developments were announced on Crimewatch this evening. Detective . Superintendent Mike Courtiour said: 'We are very interested in this car . and its possible connection to Melanie's disappearance. 'We are appealing for anyone with knowledge of it to contact us, even after all these years. Hospital worker Melanie Hall, who was last seen in a Bath nightclub in 1996. Her remains were found wrapped in plastic bags bound by tape by the side of the M5 motorway 13 years later . 'Our work into Melanie's murder remains very much active and positive. We are following up a number of leads, of which this missing Golf GTi could be very important.' Last November a 44-year-old man from Bath was arrested and questioned for two days before being released on police bail pending further inquiries. Detectives also searched a property on an estate in the city. His was the fourth suspect to be questioned about Miss Hall’s murder since her remains were discovered. At the time, her father Steve, who lives near Bradford-upon-Avon, Wiltshire, said the development was 'progress'. He said: 'We are hopeful that progress is being made. It is a long and painful process 17 years down the line. 'This would appear to be connected to the appeal we made at the beginning of October, which is great. We are keeping our minds open on these things. ‘The police are keeping us informed and we are hopeful. It is not the first time someone has been arrested in connection with her death but we are remaining positive.’ Steve Hall and Pat Hall pictured at a press conference shortly after their daughter's remains were found . Miss Hall, who worked in a hospital, was last seen in June 1996 after apparently arguing with her doctor boyfriend in a nightclub. Despite a huge police operation, no trace of her was found until 2009 when a workman found parts of her skeleton hidden in plastic bags. He was clearing undergrowth just a few yards off the northbound slip road at junction 14 of the M5 near Thornbury, Gloucestershire, when he found the remains. The find was almost 30 miles from where the psychology graduate was last seen in Cadillac’s nightclub. Five bin-liners contained or covered her remains, including arm and leg bones and her pelvis and skull. Other parts of her skeleton were found partially buried nearby. In the four years since Melanie's discovery, her parents and sister Dominique have issued repeated appeals for members of the public to help police with their inquiries.","Police believe white VW Golf GTi could be linked to Melanie Hall murder .

He says he and his friends attempted to release the baby moose back into the wild several times, but the newborn just kept reappearing and getting dangerously close to the road. Rescuer: Mr Desgroseillers says he tried to release the moose back into the wild several times but it kept following him . Mr Desgroseillers then tried to contact an animal shelter, but it seemed the place was closed. He later learned that he accidentally called the animal hospital next door instead. Not knowing what to do, Mr Desgroseillers decided to take home the moose until the shelter opened the next day. That night the moose slept in Mr Desgroseillers bed and would get up often to cry. 'She slept about half an hour at a time and then she was up for two hours whining so I had a really rough, rough night,' Mr Desgroseillers told CTV News. The next morning, Mr Desgroseillers loaded the little moose into his truck and headed for the shelter - but decided to stop at a Tim Hortons doughnut shop first for some breakfast. The moose caused quite a stir with the early-morning coffee crowd, who came out to gawk and pet the little calf. One woman, Shirley Erkila, took video of her petting the moose outside the coffee shop and called it a once-in-a- lifetime experience. 'I basically felt blessed to be in a position to have crossed a path with that little animal. I felt I need to share that with other people,' Mr Desgroseillers said. The calf is now in the care of the Wild at Heart Animal Refuge Center. The moose slept in Mr Desgroseiller's bed Sunday night, and spent most of the night crying like any new born.

Dr Rod Jouppi, who founded the center, strongly advises anyone in the same position to leave the newborn in the wild - its mother is most likely nearby. 'People sometimes out of the goodness of their hears think they're healing - they're not,' he said. The calf as determined to be a male, and is just five days old today. He weighs 25 pounds and is being cared for round-the-clock by a team of three nurses. They have named him Oliver. 'Only three people can be with him right now because he needs to bond,' said Adeline Charpin, an intern at the wildlife rehabilitation facility in Lively. 'We're doing all we can.'

A woman bit off more than she could chew at a burger restaurant and was left nursing a dislocated jaw. Nicola Peate’s jaw locked while she was eating the triple-patty 'Kids in America Burger' at Almost Famous in Liverpool. Colleagues laughed it off when the incident first happened during a work night out on and after fiance Neil finished the remainder of the burger, the pair made their way home - oblivious to the seriousness of the injury. Nicola Peate tried to eat it with a knife and fork and couldn't - but her big bite caused her jaw to dislocate . But by the time Nicola, 25, arrived at work the next day, the pain had become unbearable. She said: 'I didn’t think I’d dislocated it - you don’t expect it to happen eating a burger. 'But I tried to eat it with a knife and fork and couldn’t. I couldn’t open my mouth fully. 'It felt like I had cramp in my tongue, then I started to get an ear ache and a headache. 'The next morning I woke up and felt really, really ill. The whole side of my head was hurting. 'Then it started to feel like it was in my jaw and I knew I’d dislocated it.' A doctor at the Royal Liverpool University had to manipulate Nicola's jaw back into place . Doctors recommend cutting big bites into more manageable chunks . An x ray in the Emergency Department at . the Royal Liverpool Hospital confirmed Nicola’s fears and a doctor . quickly manipulated her jaw back into place using his thumbs. 'The minute it went back in it was like turning a tap off in my head,' Nicola remembered. 'All the tension just went.' Nicola has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), which means she has hyper-flexible joints that are unstable and therefore prone to dislocation, so she has visited many hospitals over the years. The clinical director of the Royal’s Emergency Department Kathryn Clark said: 'Thankfully, incidents such as this are rare but our staff are very experienced in diagnosing and correcting dislocations. 'I hope that in future, she takes more care when eating over-sized burgers. 'If food is too large, we would recommend cutting it into more manageable chunks, particularly if you have Elhers-danlos syndrome.' A spokeswoman for Almost Famous invited Nicola to enjoy a burger on them - complete with an emergency kit including cutlery and painkillers should she need it. She said: While it’s something that people joke about quite often, this is definitely the first instance of jaw dislocation as a result of an Almost Famous burger we've ever heard of.'","Nicola Peate's jaw locked while she was eating the triple-patty in Liverpool .

"(CNN) -- Is it ""Titanic"" for the faithful? ""Noah,"" starring Russell Crowe and directed by Darren Aronofsky, opened in theaters today, and the critics have plenty to say about the epic. For the most part, it appears the critics appreciate the efforts of both Crowe and Aronofsky -- who is best known for controversial films such as ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""Black Swan"" -- even if they don't think the pair quite pull it off. Jordan Hoffman of Screen Crush says, ""This film's inscrutable oddness -- and the willingness to take chances -- brought me to a place that could not have predicted. During the film's third act I had no idea how this movie was going to end. Seriously. Even more exciting, once the credits rolled, I had to spend some time to work out how I felt. In fact, I'm still thinking about it."" ""Dark"" is how Nathan Adams of Film School Rejects describes the big-budget flick. ""There's a tension that runs through the whole film about who you should be rooting for, or if it's even possible to root for anyone in this situation,"" he writes. ""Noah goes to such dark places over the course of the movie that it's impossible to keep relating to him as a protagonist (sometimes to the point of comedy, intentional or otherwise), and it becomes necessary for the narrative to switch its viewpoint from character to character."" The headline for Alonso Duralde's review for The Wrap reads, ""Darren Aronofsky's biblical 'Waterworld' mostly runs aground."" Duralde says that ""Unlike the thousands of CGI beasts of the land and air who hitch a ride on 'Noah,' Darren Aronofsky's highly-anticipated epic is neither fish nor fowl; in no way is it a straightforward Bible tale (and given the brevity of Genesis' account of the flood, such a thing would be next to impossible) nor is it the sort of unfettered freak-out that fans of 'Black Swan,' 'Pi' or 'The Fountain' would expect from its director and co-writer (with Ari Handel)."" HitFix's Drew McWeeny writes that ""Noah"" ""is not just one of the most ambitious films I've seen this year, it's one of the most ambitious films I've ever seen. It's a movie that is spilling over with ideas and images and emotional explorations of the metaphysical."" Opinion: Is 'Noah' sacred enough? Ty Burr of the Boston Globe says the film is ""equal parts ridiculous and magnificent."" And while noting that Crowe ""turns out to be perfectly cast in the title role,"" Burr writes that ""The parts of 'Noah' that don't work really, truly don't. But the parts that do almost sweep you away in the flood."" As the Washington Post notes, the film has had its fair share of controversy, including complaints that there is a lack of mention of God in the film. Post film critic Ann Hornaday calls it a slightly different take on the biblical story and writes, ""The result is a movie that is clearly deeply respectful of its source material but also at times startlingly revisionist, a go-for-broke throwback to Hollywood biblical epics of yore that combines grandeur and grace, as well as a generous dollop of goofy overstatement. ""Viewers may not agree about what they've seen when they come out of 'Noah,' "" she said. ""But there's no doubt that Aronofsky has made an ambitious, serious, even visionary motion picture, whose super-sized popcorn-movie vernacular may occasionally submerge the story's more reflective implications, but never drowns them entirely."" Likewise, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone cautions, ""My advice: Hold off on burning Aronofsky at the stake till you see Noah, a film of grit, grace and visual wonders that for all its tech-head modernity is built on a spiritual core. The Brooklyn-born Aronofsky and his Harvard roomie and writing partner, Ari Handel -- 'two not very religious Jewish guys,' says the director -- are hellbent on making their Noah relevant for believers and skeptics alike.""","Darren Aronofsky's ""Noah"" opens today .

"(CNN) -- In all the toing and froing that we have seen in recent weeks surrounding match-fixing -- the Europol press conference that announced more than 680 suspicious football matches worldwide and the banning of 33 players and officials for life in China -- one question has been largely overlooked: just how do you actually fix a football game? After all, football is not a sport like cricket with stops and starts. It's a team game with an ebb and flow that should make it very difficult to fix. But according to the European police investigators, the fixers and dodgy sporting people were able to successfully manipulate hundreds of games -- so how did they actually arrange these corrupted matches? In essence, there are three ways and the first is the old stand-by of a dodgy referee. There have always been officials who are willing to corrupt matches. I showed in my book ""The Fix: Soccer & Organized Crime,"" that there is a long tradition in some countries of clubs providing referees with sexual bribes before matches: good-looking young women who suddenly found the men in black irresistibly attractive. The next morning, club officials would drop a gentle word about '""ocal hospitality"" and the official, who was often married, knew that they had to provide a ""well-refereed"" match for the host team. The problem with that method is that it is very difficult for referees to deliver a fixed match. They can give away needless penalties and red cards, but in the end their capacity to actually affect a match is limited. A second method is gathering four or five players in a team to throw a match. The advantage to this scam is that it actually makes identifying a fix very difficult for a spectator. You have six players running around trying as hard as they can; and you have five players pretending to run around trying as hard as they can. This way an outsider finds it extraordinarily difficult to figure out what is going on. All they see is 11 players who may or may not be making mistakes honestly. All of whom are swearing and cursing the moment anything goes wrong. Who is on the fix or even if there is a fix occurring is very difficult to tell. The most pernicious method, and most effective, is when a fixer can get a club owner to fix matches. The Europol investigators spoke about this during their conference. There are dodgy club owners in Europe who will begin a season by looking at the 40 or so games in the league, and think, ""Right we will try to win these 30 matches, and we will lose these 10."" Morally it is a terrible thing to do. Financially, however, it makes excellent sense. Knowing that they will lose those specific 10 matches, the club owners will bet against their team and make more money losing those matches, then in winning all the other games. Last year FIFPro, the umbrella group of professional footballers' unions, conducted a survey where they spoke to over 3,000 European players about their working conditions and the possibility of corruption in the sport. The results were so shocking that FIFPro entitled the results of their survey ""The Black Book of Football."" In the report, players spoke frequently of intimidation and threats to ensure that entire teams fixed matches. And that intimidation was often coming from the owners of the teams. If corruption exists at a club, it makes it very easy to fix a match. A club owner simply has to walk into a dressing room and say, ""Right, lads. Today, you will lose the match. If you do not lose you will not get your salary for the last few months."" In those cases, all the players have to do is make sure the spectators do not notice and they have a successful fix. All this is not to say that every game is fixed. The situation is far better in Europe then Asia. In that continent, there are entire leagues like - the Chinese and South Korean -- that have had to be shut down for months while mass arrests were conducted before the sports could continue. It is to say, though, that unless serious measures are taken the world's game will be very, very badly affected.","Shanghai Shenhua stripped of 2003 and fined .

"All other arguments aside, the West should not militarily intervene in Iraq. Regardless of what might be said by politicians, Iraqi or not, Western intervention to aid Baghdad in the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) does not constitute a solution to the current crisis, nor does it work towards one. Far from it: direct military intervention by a Western state -- even if Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is requesting it -- would dramatically worsen the situation, and ISIS, contrary to what pro-interventionists might say, would inevitably come out on top. While all options might, as John Kerry said this week, remain on the table at this point, some are more ""on it"" than others. Indeed, it seems there is an international consensus that there is no appetite for Western ""boots on the ground"" (besides a very limited presence to secure national assets). If there were to be any intervention,  therefore, it seems likely it would take the form of ""targeted strikes"" from the air -- be they via drones, jets or missiles. And we are told that in that case, the focus would be exclusively on ""ISIS strongholds"" in order to ""minimize civilian casualties."" Removed from the rhetoric of politicos, though, Western intervention would bolster the propaganda efforts of ISIS, for any attack would inevitably kill or injure Muslim civilians, regardless of how well it had been planned or how good the intelligence behind it was. This would be good news for ISIS. Indeed, the group actually relies on its ability to attribute civilian casualties to its enemies. By doing so, it bolsters the skewed jihadist narrative of international politics and presents an opportunity to exaggerate the non-existent ""Crusader threat"" and defend the group's false legitimacy. In short, the more civilians that die, the more events in Iraq can be internationalized, and the wider the appeal of ISIS can become. This effect would be grossly amplified if there were deaths at the hands of the U.S. or the UK. After all, one of the central tenets of the jihadist narrative is the so-called ""War on Islam."" Through this much abused paradigm, any international involvement in a conflict involving Muslims is used by jihadists to fortify their ever-tenuous relevance in the modern world. And even were we to set aside all of the above, we still could not in any way justify intervening against ISIS in Iraq but not against Assad in Syria. Rightly or wrongly, this would be read by the region's most vulnerable as incontrovertible evidence that the West will only intervene when its own economic prosperity is at stake. Why else would it defend the rights of civilians here and not against Assad after his apparent use of chemical weapons? The West must ignore Baghdad's plea for military assistance. We must not play into the jihadists' hands. Instead, we must focus on humanitarian assistance for refugees and diplomatic pressure on al-Maliki to force him into profound and far-reaching reforms. In the long term, the only solution there can be is a political one: Iraq's economically and politically marginalized Sunnis need to be brought back into Iraq's decision-making process. But even if it is not our place to carry out military action, this is not to say that military intervention is categorically inappropriate. Indeed, if the Iraqi national army cannot pull itself together, I would argue it is absolutely necessary. However, it must be at the hands of a Sunni Muslim-majority country, in order to diffuse the narrative of Western armed forces once again attacking Muslims. If a country like Turkey or Jordan acts against it, ISIS's ""War on Islam"" rhetoric would not have anywhere near the same impact. Leaving its operational and strategic capacity to regional players, the West's focus needs to be on ISIS's ideological heart. We need to undermine its greatest rhetorical asset: that Muslims, worldwide, are under attack by the ""Crusading"" West. This can only be achieved with a policy of restraint.","Cooper says Western military intervention would play into ISIS hands .

The disclosure comes as Subway has suffered from an onslaught of bad publicity since a food blogger petitioned the chain to remove the ingredient. The ingredient, azodicarbonamide, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use as a bleaching agent and dough conditioner. It can be found in a wide variety products, including those served at McDonald's and Starbucks and breads sold in supermarkets. But the petition gained attention after it noted the chemical was also used to make yoga mats. Subway says an ingredient dubbed the 'yoga mat' chemical will be entirely phased out of its bread by next week . The ingredient, azodicarbonamide, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use as a bleaching agent and dough conditioner but the chemical is also used to make yoga mats and shoe rubber . Tony Pace, Subway's chief marketing officer, told the AP in a phone interview that the chain had started phasing the ingredient late last year and that the process should be complete within a week. Subway is privately held and doesn't disclose its sales figures. But it has apparently been feeling pressure from the uproar. 'You see the social media traffic, and people are happy that we're taking it out, but they want to know when we're taking it out,' Pace said. 'If there are people who have that hesitation, that hesitation is going to be removed.' He repeated that Subway was 'happy to invite consumers back in who might've had hesitation.' Subway, which has about 26,600 U.S. locations, had said soon after the petition surfaced in February that it was already in the process of removing the ingredient. At the time, however, the company wouldn't provide details on a timeline, prompting some to say that the chain didn't really have a plan to remove the ingredient. Pace stressed that the removal wasn't a reaction to the petition and that the changes were already underway. The company also provided a statement saying it had tested the 'Azo-free bread' in four markets this past fall. 'We're always trying to improve stuff,"" Pace said. For instance, he noted that the chain has also reduced sodium levels over the years and removed of high-fructose corn syrup from its bread.

The trend has prompted numerous food makers to adjust their recipes, even as they stand by the safety of their products.

"(CNN) -- The 2014 Tour de France will start in Northern England for the first time, organizers of cycling's most prestigious race announced Friday. The first two stages of the 101st edition of the Tour will take place in the county of Yorkshire, with Leeds the host city of the Grand Depart. The third stage will move south with the finish in London, which successfully hosted the start of the 2007 Tour de France. British riders dominated this year's Tour as Bradley Wiggins recorded a memorable victory with his teammate Chris Froome in second place, while sprinting star Mark Cavendish claimed three stage wins. Wiggins went on to claim the gold medal in the men's time trial at the 2012 London Olympics, as millions crammed the roadside to watch his heroics. Christian Prudhomme, the director of the Tour de France, said this had been a major factor in their decision. ""Since the resounding success of the Grand Depart in London in 2007, we were very keen to return to the United Kingdom, . ""Bradley Wiggins' historic victory last July and the enormous crowds that followed the cycling events in the streets of London during the Olympic Games encouraged us to go back earlier than we had initially planned. ""Yorkshire is a region of outstanding beauty, with breathtaking landscapes whose terrains offer both sprinters and attackers the opportunity to express themselves,"" he added. Yorkshire is the biggest county in England and is the home of three notable former Tour de France riders in Brian Robinson, the first Britain to win a stage of the Tour de France in 1958, Barry Hoban, who won eight stages and Malcolm Elliott, the first British rider to hold the green points jersey in the three-week race. The region is likely to reap an economic benefit from hosting two stages, with an estimated two million people watching the equivalent legs of the 2007 race in the British capital and the southern county of Kent, bringing $141 million in extra revenue, according the the main backer of the start, Transport for London. Gary Verity, chief executive of Welcome to Yorkshire, the agency behind the county's bid, said they were proud to have been selected. ""It will mean less than two years after hosting the Olympics the British public can look forward to another of the world's biggest sporting events coming to the country, "" he said. Since its inception in 1903, the Tour de France has become one of the top global sporting events with millions of fans lining the 3,500km route to cheer on the peloton.","2014 Tour de France will start in Northern England .

Legal action: PC Kelly Jones has dropped the case brought against a man who dialled 999 . A police tsar has warned that Ministers must clamp down on a compensation culture fuelled by  no-win, no-fee lawyers, after a woman officer who tried to sue a crime victim finally dropped her claim. PC Kelly Jones launched a compensation bid against the owner of a garage where she tripped while investigating a suspected burglary, in a case that caused outrage when revealed by The Mail on Sunday. Last week PC Jones withdrew her legal bid although her ‘union’, the Police Federation, maintained she only ever wanted to recover income lost through her injury. In the wake of her climbdown, the elected Police and Crime Commissioner in her force area said the case marked a new low in the compensation culture that has ‘infected’ the police and other public services. Stephen Bett, the independent PCC for Norfolk, said: ‘This mindless no-win, no-fee compensation culture is being driven by greedy lawyers. It’s rife. Everybody seems to believe they can make a fast buck. ‘This case of a PC who suffered an injury answering a 999 call was driven by lawyers. 'It was ridiculous and it should give Westminster the ammunition it needs to legislate against them. ‘They should be told that if they fail, as they did in this case, they’ll be given a hefty bill for costs. It would act as a deterrent.’ Fall: PC Kelly Jones (right) launched her legal action in March this year after injuring her wrist at Steve Jones' garage (left) when answering a 999 call . Mr Bett fears the case has tarnished the reputation of the police. He said: ‘The actions of this PC degrade what huge numbers of police officers do every day – running the risk of being stabbed or hit by a car. ‘The officer involved faced a huge amount of opprobrium for her actions, but she has raised questions over the genuine and vital compensation awards made to officers who have been badly hurt in the line of duty.’ PC Jones, 34, a mother of two from Thetford, Norfolk, was called to a service station in the town in August 2012 and hurt her leg and arm in a minor fall. In March this year she launched her action against garage owner Steve Jones seeking tens of thousands of pounds in compensation. After she dropped her claim, Mr Jones said he was delighted, describing it as a ‘victory for common sense’. Scene: PC Jones tripped over at this petrol station owned by Steve Jones while investigating a break-in . The woman with a conviction for theft who sued the police for refusing to make her a constable has been sacked from her civilian police job after a row involving her own colleagues. Rachida Sobhi, 43, became embroiled in an argument with litter wardens after she was issued with an £80 on-the-spot penalty for dropping a cigarette butt near her home. The uniformed enforcement officers from Kingdom Security, employed by Bromley Council in South London, called the police. Miss Sobhi, a Metropolitan Police Community Support Officer, paid the fine after the dispute in December but her bosses at Scotland Yard hauled her before a disciplinary hearing. The panel concluded she had behaved badly towards the law enforcement officers and sacked her. Miss Sobhi had been part of the safer neighbourhoods team in the Kelsey and Eden Park areas in Bromley. She was employed despite her decades-old criminal record for theft, but took legal action when chiefs would not give her a job as a PC. Despite the latest development, Miss Sobhi is still pursuing her landmark claim against the Met and it will go before a fresh employment tribunal preliminary hearing on October 18.

"Something ELSE to worry about?! Ear lobe surgery is on the rise (seriously) First there were cankles. Then there was back fat. Last week we were told about swoobs, mere moments after we'd come to terms with our big fat thutts. But it seems the beauty industry hasn't yet run out of body parts they want to make us hate, then yearn to rip up and rebuild, stuffed full of collagen and Botox. Well, not quite yet. And the object of their contempt now? Our poor little earlobes. Yes, try as they might to hide way up high behind hair and earrings, even these adorably plump dinky danglers are not safe from the surgeon's knife. While most of us probably hadn't noticed our ears dangling lower than usual (or ever considered it much of a problem), cosmetic clinics are adamant that as we age our earlobes can begin to sag and grow longer, developing wrinkles and creases. And luckily for us girls, experts say this condition is generally only present in females, and is often made worse by the use of earrings over the years. However, with ear accessories such as the use of stretching tapers growing ever more popular with men, there is an increasing number of cases of male earlobe droop. One clinic is even offering . an earlobe rejuvenation treatment, claiming that with the application . of dermal fillers such as Juvederm and Restylane you can now . 'revolumise and restore your earlobes to give them a more youthful . looking appearance'. Experts use a hyaluronic filler, . such as Juvaderm, Emervel or Restylane, to create this tissue-expanding . earlobe effect. And while Botox notoriously wears off after about four months, the clinic claims that the use of dermal filler in the earlobe tightens the lobe for far longer than when used in other areas, mainly due to the lack of wear and tear or any muscle movement in the area being treated. Regency Aesthetics in London offer the £195 treatment, and describe it as the ideal 'lunch-time earlobe lift' - and proclaim you can, thank goodness, even wear your earrings . immediately after treatment with no swelling or bruising. Speaking . about the new treatment, Dr Rikin said: 'Women come to us to subtly . enhance their look and opting for treatments such as Earlobe Rejuvenation . enables them to give the appearance of true youth in the places that . matter.' Time to ditch the bling? Experts say this condition is generally only present in females and is often made worse by the use of earrings over the years, especially big, heavy ones favoured by the likes of Kim Kardashian . Body image and wellbeing expert Katie Lowe of Fat Girl PhD said: 'I'd love to think that this is some kind of practical joke thrown out by the beauty industry, but it's nowhere near April Fool's Day yet - so I can only assume this is real. 'It's comical, really - unless anyone actually falls for it. Every time these cynical surgical types - who are quite clearly looking to make a quick buck out of people's insecurities - publicise a treatment like this, they're just perpetuating a ""perfection at all costs"" myth, and making people think negatively about a part of their body that nobody should ever, ever worry about. 'When I'm trying to work out how to show my true youth in a place that matters, I can safely say my earlobes are (and should be) categorically the bottom of the list. 'It's absolutely ridiculous, and I hope people see it that way - and spend their lunch times having a bite to eat, rather than an over-priced, ridiculous beauty treatment!'.

"Five men from Yemen were freed from the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after more than a dozen years of captivity. Four of the men went to Oman: Al Khadr Abdallah Muhammad Al Yafi, Fadel Hussein Saleh Hentif, Abd Al-Rahman Abdullah Au Shabati, and Mohammed Ahmed Salam.

Pledge: President Barack Obama came into office pledging to close the detention center on the U.S. base . The release is the latest in a wave that have alarmed congressional opponents of closing the detention center. The men had been cleared for release since at least 2009 but the U.S. has balked at repatriating Guantanamo prisoners back to Yemen, where the government is battling an al-Qaeda insurgency. All five were captured in Pakistan and detained by the U.S. as suspected al-Qaeda fighters. None were ever charged with a crime, the Miami Herald reports. U.S. officials later determined it was no longer necessary to detain them but have struggled to find other countries willing to take them in. The men are all in their 30s and 40s, including one who was 17 when he was sent to Guantanamo. President Barack Obama came into office pledging to close the detention center on the U.S. base but was blocked by Congress, which barred transferring any prisoner to the U.S. for any reason and imposed restrictions on sending them elsewhere. Congress eased the restrictions on transfers abroad in December 2013 and the Obama administration has stepped up the releases in recent months. There are now 122 prisoners at Guantanamo, including 54 who have been approved for transfer. Of those cleared to leave, 47 are Yemeni and will likely have to be resettled in other countries, given the security situation in their homeland. 'We are committed to closing the detention facility. That's our goal and we are working toward that goal,' said Ian Moss, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department on Guantanamo issues. Prisoners: There are now 122 prisoners at Guantanamo, including 54 who have been approved for transfer . The recent releases have angered some members of Congress, who have argued that Guantanamo is necessary to detain terrorism suspects. Republican senators on Tuesday proposed restrictions that would bar transfers to Yemen for two years and suspend the transfer of men previously classified as high-risk or medium-risk. 'Now is not the time to be emptying Guantanamo,' Sen. Kelly Ayottee said at a news conference during which she warned of fresh terrorist threats.","Five men from Yemen were freed from the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after more than a dozen years of captivity .

The adverts look like Instagram pictures posted by friends, but have 'Sponsored' written in the top right-hand corner. Adverts can be hidden from a feed by clicking the 'More' button, which consists of three small circles. Users can give feedback to companies about they liked or disliked a particular advert. The first brands to sign up to the scheme were Adidas, Ben and Jerry's, Burberry, General Electric, Lexus, Levi's, Macy's, Michael Kors, PayPal and Starwood. The company said that advertisers has seen positive results ‘well above the ad industry’s average for performance’. Instagram was acquired by Facebook in 2012 for $1bn and has over 200million users across the globe. The company said that it is ‘methodical and deliberate’ about choosing which brands pop up in users’ feeds. There are strict rules that advertisers have to adhere to, such as no text to accompany images and no product shots. Instead, images should capture ‘moments’. In short, the adverts are designed to look like they are posted by your friends. Adverts being rolled out in the new regions are expected to follow the same format as those shown in the U.S. And, if their introduction also follows suit, global Instagram users will initially rubbish the decision to introduce adverts, before accepting and even liking them, as seen with their U.S. counterparts.

"Former England manager Fabio Capello used a word associated with homophobic abuse in a radio interview in which he also defended racist comments made by Arrigo Sacchi. Capello had been asked if he thought criticism of current La Liga champions Atletico Madrid for an over-physical approach was justified and he replied: 'I don't agree that they are violent. Football is not for mariquitas.' The Spanish word mariquitas is the diminutive of marica which is an offensive terms used against gay people. Capello could argue in this context a closer translation would be 'football is not for fairies' but many took to social media to condemn the comments made on Spain's Onda Cero radio station. Fabio Capello has come under fire after using the derogative term for gay people during his radio interview . In the same interview Capello defended Sacchi over comments from the former Italy boss earlier this week. Sacchi had said toTuttosport: 'Italy has too many foreign players. Look at the Viareggio tournament, I would say there are too many black players.' He later claimed his record as a coach demonstrated he was not a racist. 'What he said is not racism,' said Capello. 'We just need to have more Italian players in our youth academies, [players] with an Italian identity. We also have black players who are Italian but he was referring to the youth teams that have eight or nine foreign players in them.' Capello's comments include him talking about Spanish dictator Francisco Franco in a good light . Capello is no stranger to controversy. In 2006 after his first spell as Real Madrid coach he returned to Italy telling newspaper La Repubblica that he missed the combination of: 'Latin creativity and the rigorous order that Franco left behind' in Spain. The comments horrified those who had suffered under the dictator during his 36-year-reign. Capello was paid £6million a year by the Football Association as England manager but was sacked after four unproductive years. He is currently Russia's head coach but his time in charge has been marred by appalling results and problems over unpaid wages.

"By . Jason Groves, Political Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 16:27 EST, 27 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:27 EST, 27 July 2012 . Ministers were shamed into witholding a £16million aid payment to Rwanda last night following mounting criticism of their support for a regime accused of serious human rights abuses. The Department for International Development (DFID) confirmed that the payment had been blocked indefinitely while officials investigate evidence that Rwanda has been fuelling a bloody civil war in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo. The move is a major embarrassment for the Government, which has been a staunch defender of the Rwandan government and its controversial president Paul Kagame, who was due in London last night for the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. Bloodmoney? Aid payments from the UK to Rwanda have been blocked while officials investigate evidence that Rwanda has been fuelling a bloody civil war in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo . David Cameron and International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell have publicly defended Kagame, despite mounting allegations of human rights abuses within both Rwanda and its neighbours. Tony Blair is also an enthusiastic supporter of Kagame, and has described him as a ‘visionary leader’ and a ‘great friend’. Accusations: Rwanda's controversial president Paul Kagame . Kagame’s regime is heavily dependent on . foreign aid, which accounts for a third of its annual budget, and . Britain is the tiny East African country’s biggest foreign donor. This year it is due to give £75million. The Dutch government suspended its entire aid programme to the country earlier this week, and Washington has also frozen military support. Now, apparently stung by criticism that they were ‘turning a blind eye’ to human rights abuses, UK ministers have also decided to act. Carina Tertsakian of the campaign group Human Rights Watch said the Government’s support for Kagame’s regime was ‘becoming embarrassing’. Welcoming the suspension of aid, she said: ‘DFID has provided almost unconditional support to Rwanda, despite abundant evidence of human rights violations inside Rwanda, and Rwanda’s persistent interference in armed conflict in neighbouring Congo. ‘We hope that this signals a long-overdue shift in UK policy on Rwanda, and that the Government will now take a strong stand not only on Rwanda’s role in fuelling the deadly conflict in Congo, but on severe restrictions on freedom of expression inside Rwanda. Rwanda remains a country ruled by fear, in which opposition parties are not allowed to function, and people end up in prison simply for daring to criticise the government.’ Mr Mitchell, who visited Rwanda last week, said he had delivered a ‘frank’ message to Kagame about alleged human rights abuses. A DFID spokesman said the aid payment . had been delayed while Mr Mitchell considers whether Rwanda is meeting . its commitment to respect human rights, a key element in any British aid . programme. Tony Blair described Kagame as a 'visionary leader' and a 'great friend' while David Cameron has publicly defended him, despite mounting allegations of human rights abuses . Two years ago the United Nations published a damning report alleging appalling war crimes by the Tutsi army in 1995, which Kagame led. But supporters of President Kagame insist that his record has to be seen in the context of his country’s war-torn recent history. Kagame disputes the UN findings.","Major embarrassment for the Government, .

"Supersonic skydiver Felix Baumgartner has been found guilty of punching a Greek lorry driver in the face in a road rage incident in his home town of Salzburg, Austria two years ago. Baumgartner, who last month broke the world record altitude for a parachute jump in the Red Bull Stratos project, had appealed against the conviction for assault but a three-judge appeals panel today upheld the verdict. Baumgartner, 43, was fined 1,500 euros but escaped jail for the assault on September 30, 2010. Convicted: World record sky diver Felix Baumgartner was found guilty of assaulting a Greek lorry driver in his home town of Salzburg, Austria two years ago in an appeal hearing held today . Record breaker: Just last month, Baumgartner, 43, set a new record for the highest parachute jump when he fell from a height of 24 miles at a speed of 834mph . The victim, named only as Dimitrios P, 38, for legal reasons, told Austrian media that the punch came 'out of the blue' and left 'blood everywhere'. He said: 'I was waiting at a roundabout and there were about four cars in front of me. He didn't want to wait and overtook us all and then of course got wedged on the roundabout. 'The other driver that was involved was his photographer - and he felt that he could also do the same and followed Mr Baumgartner, at which point I decided to have a work with the photographer. 'Mr Baumgartner decided that it was his job to get involved and he tried to claim I had attacked him and it was self-defence, but this is madness. 'There were two of them. The reality is that he punched me full in the face with his fist and left me with a cut. Falling to earth: Baumgartner, seen here during his record jump, punched the Greek lorry driver in the face following an argument, leaving 'blood everywhere' Flashpoint: The assault happened when Baumgartner overtook the lorry, which was queuing at a roundabout . 'There was blood everywhere. I never tried to conceal anything at the court - I admitted that I had tried to kick him but it was only in retaliation. 'He was just acting the tough guy and showing off and making himself the hero, but he isn't a hero at all.' He added that he was glad people could see what Mr Baumgartner, a former boxer, was really like. Dimitrios said that after hitting him, Mr Baumgartner returned to his car and drove off. In the original trial the court chose to believe the version of events put forward by the Greek man rather than that of Baumgartner and the German photographer. Charged: Baumgartner, who didn't attend the appeal hearing because he is on a speaking tour, was fined 1,500 euros but escaped a jail term . Baumgartner was not present during today's court hearing as he is currently on a tour talking about his adventures. On October 24, he jumped from a helium balloon at an altitude of 39km (24 miles), reaching an estimated speed of 1,342km/h (834mph) and breaking the sound barrier during his descent, the first person to do so. In the process, he established new records for the highest manned balloon flight, the parachute jump from the highest altitude and the greatest free fall velocity.","Baumgartner, 43, fined 1,500 euros by judges in appeal hearing, but escapes jail term .

"For District Attorney Sam Sutter, prosecuting fallen NFL football star Aaron Hernandez carries a kind of pressure unprecedented in his six years of service. ""Probably my career ... will be defined more by this case than all of the other things we've done,"" the top law enforcer in Bristol County, Massachusetts, told CNN. ""To that extent, there is added pressure. I can't say in any way that we shirk from it. We welcome it."" A crush of cameras and journalists follows Hernandez, the former New England Patriots tight end, each time he appears in court, including Thursday, when a grand jury indicted him on a first-degree murder charge in the execution-style shooting death of friend Odin Lloyd. Hernandez, who is being held without bail, has pleaded not guilty. His attorney, Michael Fee, calls Hernandez an innocent man and says ""there has been an incredible rush to judgment in this case."" According to a biography on his office's website, Sutter has worked to solve old homicides and ""has employed a series of new and aggressive strategies to attack the problem of gun violence."" He was elected in 2006 and re-elected four years later. The Democrat lost a bid for Congress in 2012. Neither Sutter nor Fee can speak to the evidence because of a court-imposed gag order. ""We have won 14 out of our last 15 murder trials,"" Sutter said. ""I think that's a pretty darn good record."" The next step in Hernandez's case is his arraignment, during which he'll be informed of the crimes he is charged with. Hernandez also faces five weapons charges. Co-defendant Ernest Wallace, who was allegedly in the car with Hernandez the night Lloyd was killed, also was indicted. He was charged with being accessory after the fact to murder. The grand jury also has indicted Tanya Singleton, Hernandez' cousin, for contempt of court. She's charged with refusing to testify before a grand jury, despite being granted immunity. Lloyd's body was found June 17, riddled with five bullets in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez' luxury home in North Attleborough. From there, it's roughly a 20 minute drive to the New England Patriots' Gillette Stadium. Authorities have said Hernandez, Carlos Ortiz and Wallace picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment. Sources have told CNN that Ortiz, who is facing a weapons allegation, is cooperating with authorities. Sutter won't say whether Ortiz is getting a special deal. ""Mr. Ortiz is charged with a serious crime,"" Sutter told CNN. ""Whether or not he's indicted remains to be seen, but right now, he's not getting a pass."" In search warrant affidavits for her home, investigators allege Singleton helped Wallace escape by buying him a bus ticket to Florida. Sutter said Singleton's refusal to testify is ""definitely unusual."" ""We'll see what she does. But I'm not gonna comment on her position, her defiance,"" Sutter said. Singleton's lawyer, Peter Parker, declined comment to CNN. His client has pleaded not guilty. CNN legal analyst Paul Callan suggested that Singleton's decision may indicate she's either extremely loyal or may be worried about something. ""Her refusal of immunity is very surprising,"" he said. As the case moves to Massachusetts Superior Court, Hernandez continues to be held without bail. No trial date has been set.","Former NFL player is charged with first-degree murder, weapons charges .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo equaled the Spanish league scoring record with two more goals in Sunday's 3-1 victory at Villarreal. The Portugal captain took his tally in La Liga to 38 ahead of next weekend's final match at home to relegated Almeria, with Real's title hopes having ended in midweek. His closest rival is Lionel Messi on 31, but the world player of the year was rested for Barcelona's 0-0 draw against lowly Deportivo La Coruna ahead of the May 28 Champions League final against Manchester United. Barca, who clinched the title on Wednesday with two matches to play, were presented the La Liga trophy in front of their home fans after a low-key match. Barcelona crowned Spanish champions after Levante draw . Ronaldo is now level with the 1951 effort of Athletic Bilbao's Telmo Zarra, which was matched by Real's Hugo Sanchez in 1990, after scoring nine times in the last three matches. Both against Villarreal came from free-kicks, with the first soon after Marcelo's 17th-minute opener and the second in time added on at the end of the match. It took him to 51 goals in all competitions this season, one behind Messi's Spanish record, while Real have now netted 94 times to Barca's 92 in La Liga. Fourth-placed Villarreal, who reduced the deficit through Ruben Cani six minutes after halftime, will have to go through the Champions League qualifying round next season. Valencia clinched third place for the second time in a row with a 0-0 draw against local rivals Levante to secure a group-stage place in Europe's top tournament. Athletic Bilbao, Atletico Madrid and Sevilla will battle for the two Europa League places next weekend, with all three clubs on 55 points. Bilbao were held 1-1 at home by 10-man Malaga, while Sevilla beat Real Sociedad 3-1 and Atletico won 2-1 against relegated Hercules in manager Quique Sanchez Flores' final home game in charge of the 2010 Europa League champions. Six clubs will battle to avoid filling the final relegation spot next week, with Zaragoza on 42 points, Deportivo and Getafe on 43 and Mallorca, Sociedad and Osasuna on 44. Robinho double helps champions Milan rebound . In Italy, deposed champions Inter Milan secured second place with a round to play after a 1-1 draw with Napoli that ensured the home team will finish third and enter the Champions League draw at the group stage. Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o put Inter ahead with his 21st league goal this season, while Colombian defender Juan Camilo Zuniga equalized on halftime. The battle for a berth in the competition's qualifying draw will go to the final round after Udinese won 2-0 at Chievo to reclaim fourth place from Lazio. Sixth-placed Roma's Champions League hopes ended with a 2-1 defeat at Catania, leaving the side three points behind capital rivals Lazio. Seventh-placed Juventus lost 1-0 at Parma, so must beat Napoli next weekend and hope Roma lose to Sampdoria in order to qualify for the Europa League. Sampdoria dropped out of the top flight just a season after qualifying for the Champions League following a 2-1 defeat at home to Palermo. The club finished fourth in 2009-10 but followed Brescia and Bari in going down to Serie A. Lecce survived after a 2-0 win at Bari put the club five points clear of Sampdoria.","Cristiano Ronaldo's double gives Real Madrid forward 38 league goals this season .

A child was sick for 48 hours after her mother inadvertently fed her baby milk from Tesco that was ten months out of date. Jerri Lee gave two-month-old daughter Milan a bottle of organic milk she had bought on the way home from work. But within moments the baby was sick and then remained ill for two days. Photographer and model Miss Lee checked the bottle as Milan had never been sick before and had been healthy since she was born. To her horror she found that the milk she had just given her was from a box of six small bottles whose sell-by date had expired ten months earlier. Miss Lee, who has appeared in The Only Way is Essex, said: ‘You don’t know what could have been in that bottle. ‘They expire for a reason – who knows what harm it could have done? She is not a sicky baby but she was sick continuously over a 48 hour period. I was absolutely disgusted, the bottle was nearly a year old, she was only two-and-a-half months old, it’s awful. ‘It is milk for a newborn, so it could have been so much worse, with an immune system that has no back up. It could have been so dangerous.’ Miss Lee said she took Milan to her doctor who confirmed her daughter had been made sick by the milk. Scroll down for video .

She messaged the HiPP helpline where staff told her there was nothing dangerous in the product and it could not do any lasting harm to her baby. Miss Lee added: ‘I rang NHS Direct straight after that where I was told to keep an eye on Milan and check her throughout the night.

A tiny book of psalms from 1640, believed to be the first book printed in what's now the United States, sold for just under $14.2 million on Tuesday, setting an auction record for a printed book. The Bay Psalm Book, which was auctioned at Sotheby's in Manhattan, had a pre-sale estimate of $15 million to $30 million. A copy of John James Audubon's 'Birds of America' was the previous record-holder, selling for $11.5 million at Sotheby's in 2010. Only 11 copies of the Bay Psalm Book survive in varying degrees of completeness. The book sold at Sotheby's was one of . two owned by Boston's Old South Church, which voted to sell it to . increase its grants and ministries. Scroll down for video . Described as 'the world's most valuable book', this Bay Psalm Book, which is the first book ever printed in what is now the United States, sold at Sotheby's for just under $14.2 million . With a pre-sale between $15 to $30 million, the book was published in Cambridge, Mass., by the Puritan leaders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1640 . Samuel Adams was a member and Benjamin Franklin was baptized at the church, which was established in 1669. 'This is enormous for us,' said the Rev. Nancy Taylor, senior minister of the church. 'It is life-changing for the ministries we can do.' The book was bought over the phone by American businessman and philanthropist David Rubenstein, who plans to lend it to libraries around the country. The sale price included the buyer's premium. In April, Taylor called the book 'spectacular' and said it is 'arguably one of the most important books in this nation's history'. The church owned five copies of the 6-inch-by-5-inch book. One is now at the Library of Congress, one is at Yale University and one is at Brown University. The . book was published in Cambridge, Mass., by the Puritan leaders of the . Massachusetts Bay Colony just 20 years after the Pilgrims landed at . Plymouth. It was supposed . to be a faithful translation into English of the original Hebrew psalms - . puritans believed selected paraphrases would compromise their . salvation. The 1,700 copies were printed on a press shipped from London. 'Arguably one of the most important books in this nation's history', the book was bought over the phone by American businessman and philanthropist David Rubenstein, who plans to lend it to libraries around the country. A yellowed title page, adorned with decorative flourishes, reads: 'The Whole Booke of Psalmes, Faithfully Translated into English Metre.' At the bottom, it says: 'Imprinted 1640.' Historians believe an almanac may have come off the press before the Bay Psalm Book. But the chief of rare books and special collections at the Library of Congress, Mark Dimunation, has said the almanac was more of a pamphlet or a broadsheet than a book. No copy of the almanac exists today. Dimunation noted that in the Americas, in general, books were printed in what is now Mexico as early as 1539. 'American poetry, American spirituality and the printed page all kind of combine and find themselves located in a single volume,' Dimunation said of the Bay Psalm Book. The last time a copy came on the auction block, in 1947, it sold for a record auction price of $151,000, surpassing auction prices for the Gutenberg Bible, Shakespeare's First Folio and 'Birds of America.'. The auction record for any book goes to the Leonardo da Vinci Codex Hammer, a personal notebook of scientific writings and diagrams.

"If you've a Batman fan in your life and you don't know what to buy them for Christmas, it would be hard to do better than this: a life-size, fully-functional Batmobile. Costing £90,000, which is considerably less than the £2.3million paid for the original TV Batmobile earlier this year, this replica with a straight six, fuel-injected modern Jaguar 3.2 litre engine with automatic transmission is practically a bargain. The jet black machine with functional flame-thrower at the back is based on the Batmobile driven by Michael Keaton’s caped crusader in the 1989 blockbuster, and will be one of the star lots when it goes up for auction in Weybridge, Surrey, at the end of the month. The Batmobile replica comes complete with flame-thrower and is expected to sell for £90,000 at auction . The road-legal car has its own flame-thrower and hydraulic suspension that can raise it nine inches . Impressive spoilers: This Batmobile was inspired by the car in the 1989 Batman film directed by Tim Burton . Built in the UK on custom chassis, the rear-wheel drive Batmobile comes complete with a fully operational flame thrower and hydraulic suspension which can raise the car by a further nine inches. It is claimed the car will hit 60mph in less than five seconds, although the visibility has been compared to that of a fighter jet. The replica, which took a year to build, was inspired by the 1989 Batman rather than the recent Christopher Nolan trilogy. In the film, Bruce Wayne’s alter-ego goes up against Jack Nicholson’s Joker character, who wreaks havoc on the people of Gotham City. The car will go up for sale at the Historics car auction on 30 November, and is expected to sell for between £70,000 and £90,000. Edward Bridger-Stille, from Historics, said: 'The car is like a dream for any Batman fan. It brings traffic to a standstill with people wanting to be photographed by it. Where do you put your latte?

"It's always been Match Of The Day 2's job to be the more rock n' roll version of its Saturday night, big arena counterpart. The quirky use of music, voiceovers and graphics likes to play with convention. And on Sunday night, they really pushed the boat out by inviting Manchester City's most famous fan-with-a-band to take the middle seat in pundit corner. Musician and Manchester City fan Noel Gallagher made his first appearance on Match Of The Day 2 . Jermaine Jenas (left), Gallagher (middle) and Mark Lawrenson (right) appeared on Sunday night's show . In fact, the trio sitting opposite Mark Chapman looked like they could just as easily be about to share their thoughts with us on the latest floor-fillers from the hit parade. Jermaine Jenas, to Noel's right, would make a perfectly good ex-boy band member. While Mark Lawrenson to his left looked like he could be about to take the Bay City Rollers back out on the road again. But as Chappers pointed out, it was Noel's 'fan's eye view' that he was there for. Which included being filmed on a very successful trip to see his team take Newcastle United apart at The Etihad. After we'd seen Gallagher leaping about in the stands, Chapman asked him back in the studio if he missed being just in amongst the fans? The 47-year-old was in good spirits on the BBC's football highlights programme . Gallagher wasn't impressed with Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho's appeared continued dig at refeeres . 'You sign too many autographs', replied Noel, clearly as someone wanting to keep his eye on the action. 'Although he did add '(there's) champagne in the director's box...and they've got these heated seats.' Having appeared to be something of the angry and cynical young pop star, Noel seems to have turned into a musician and grown-up who has no trouble keeping a twinkle in his eye nowadays. We saw that working well last November in his little Manchester derby-day battle with Gary Neville. And once again here he proved to be insightful, knowledgeable and witty. He warmed up for his contribution to the show by eulogising 'the Brodge' - better known to you and me as Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. Gallagher joked that if he was the referee he'd send Wayne Rooney (right) off before he put his boots on . Gallagher referred to Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers as 'the Brodge' on Sunday night's programme . 'One should never underestimate the Brodge' was Noel's prophetic advise about him and his resurging Liverpool team, before proclaiming 'power to the Brodge!'. This he did as part of a theme that he was to pursue throughout the night. Namely, have a pop at United. Because Gallagher was all about Liverpool staying in the top four, so as to keep Manchester United out of it. He then went on to point out, quite reasonably, that managers should take some responsibility in the issue of how to improve refereeing. He also said he wouldn't mind having a go on the whistle himself. But mainly, it would seem, because 'Rooney (would) be getting sent off before he put his boots on'. He was also quite happy to offer to sit alongside Sir Alex on the show should he be required to do so. I imagine a call was put into the Ferguson household immediately. There were also a few words to be had about Jose Mourinho, particularly for his 'digging out of referees'. But he did still concede that he thought it was going to be Chelsea's title, if only 'by two or three points, though'. Which must have been particularly galling for him. Because when Chappers asked him - at the end of a most entertaining programme that he fully contributed to - if seeing his team win the Champions League was his ultimate ambition, Noel pondered for a moment and replied 'if I'm honest, I'd like to win the Premier League more'. Which would be definitely, then, Noel? No, maybe?","Noel Gallagher was a pundit on Match Of The Day 2 on Sunday night .

"CLICK HERE to read Sam Peters' full match report from Twickenham . England’s players showed solidarity with their cash-strapped opponents at the final whistle as they gathered for a silent prayer on the Twickenham turf. Captain Chris Robshaw and his team-mates formed a circle with Samoa — who had threatened to boycott the game in a row over pay and governance with their union. ‘That is the brilliant thing about the rugby community,’ said Robshaw. ‘You support each other. They could have pulled out, so we’re extremely grateful they honoured the game.’ England and Samoa players united after the game to show their solidarity at Twickenham . Chris Robshaw led players in a show of appreciation to Samoa for allowing the game to go ahead . The Samoa team had threatened to strike ahead of the game after problems with their governing body . 'We want to thank all the Samoan guys for the way they played, we know they've got a lot of issues at the moment and all the England guys are really appreciative of the spirit and the way the game was played today,' he told Sky Sports 2. 'I think it was a great spectacle, even if it was a bit loose at times, but all the English team are very grateful.' Another thing the English players will be grateful for is the win after a torrid run of five defeats on the bounce was finally brought to an end. Bath's George Ford (centre) impressed on his full international debut at fly-half . Jonny May uses his blistering pace to open the scoring for England in the first half . All of those defeats, of course, came against the two top ranked teams in the world in New Zealand and South Africa, but Robshaw admitted it was great to just get back to winning ways. 'It was great to get a win. It's a results business and we know there was a few errors out there and we were a little bit loose with the ball, but it was great to play a game here at night and the crowd were absolutely fantastic,' he added. Despite looking disjointed at times England still managed to run in three tries, with Jonny May dotting down twice and Mike Brown crossing over after a delightful offload from Anthony Watson. Mike Brown (centre) crosses over to get England back to winning ways after a dismal recent run . May crosses the line to score his second try in England's 28-9 defeat of Samoa . One of the biggest positives was the performance of new fly-half George Ford, who played a key role in May's first try with a loop around Owen Farrell and then set up Brown's touch down with a well-worked cross-field kick to Bath team-mate Watson. Speaking in front of the Sky cameras after his first senior start for England, the 21-year-old, who also kicked over 13 points, said: 'I think we got there in the end. The start was very scrappy. Obviously, Samoa are a very physical team and they came flying at us. 'We probably didn't adapt to that quickly enough I suppose and with the rain coming down we should have gone for field position.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- How does a man from an unassuming Dutch village go to being loved in South Korea, adored in Australia, revered in Russia and admired in England? Guus Hiddink, the Russia and Chelsea coach, has had much to smile about in his 22-year managerial career. By being an exceptional football manager, for one. Enjoying success around the world -- at different levels with different players in different cultures -- has made Guus Hiddink one of the most admired bosses around. Born in rural Varsseveld, near the German border, in 1946, Hiddink's early years were unremarkable. While playing semi-professional football, he spent 10 years as a gym teacher at a school for children with learning difficulties. Most of his playing days were in the midfield of De Graafschap, a smallish club with no history of winning silverware. He later spent two years playing in America before returning to retire at De Graafschap. Watch CNN's exclusive interview with Hiddink » . Little, then, to suggest that here was a man who would achieve so much in his later career. But great players seldom become great managers. His first steps in that direction came at De Graafschap, Holland, where he was assistant manager before moving to the same role at Dutch giants PSV Eindhoven.  See key moments from Hiddink's career » . By 1987, at the age of 40, he was in charge of PSV and led them to their 1988 European Cup win, a feat unthinkable today. He almost reached the final again in 2005 during his second spell in Eindhoven. Hiddink's keeper at PSV, Hans van Breukelen, revealed some of the manager's methods. ""He's very interested in people and immediately tries to create a family environment,"" he told Britain's Sun newspaper. ""I can vividly remember him smoking and having a cup of coffee with his players. I don't know if he still smokes, but he was a chain smoker at PSV."" Hiddink's resume includes stints in other high-pressure jobs such as Fenerbahce, Valencia and Real Madrid, but it's on the international scene where his shrewd tactical mind, organizational skills and motivational prowess grabbed attention. Semifinalists with Holland at the 1998 World Cup, he took over South Korea in 2001 and led the co-hosts of the 2002 World Cup to the last four. No Asian country had ever gone as far in a World Cup before and he left the job a national hero. He agreed to coach another underdog in the shape of Australia in 2005 and led them to the 2006 World Cup. There, the Socceroos had eventual winners Italy rattled for much of their second-round match before succumbing to a late, controversial penalty. Hiddink took Russia to Euro 2008, where they were beaten by Spain at the semifinal stage. Naturally his hometown Varsseveld wanted to capitalize on Hiddink's huge global popularity. The ""Guuseum"" was built in his honor, which for a time was particularly popular with South Koreans on a pilgrimage to see from where their idol hailed. Chelsea were in the doldrums when he arrived on a short-term deal in January as a favor to his comrade, Roman Abramovich, the club's billionaire owner. And the Hiddink magic has worked again, giving the Blues direction to a season that was drifting under previous boss Luiz Felipe Scolari. But the straight-speaking Dutchman is loyal to the project he has in charge of the Russian national side and insists he will leave Chelsea at the end of the season regardless. Sure of himself but free of ego, Hiddink knows what he wants. And, as he's repeatedly proved, he knows how to get it too.","Born in 1946, Hiddink has become one of the best managers in the world .

As summer ends and the air turns colder, the skies are filled with birds flying south for the winter - and this year they were joined by another winged creature of a more ethereal nature. But the eagle that appeared over Filton in Bristol this morning was not there to prey on the smaller swallows and swifts on their annual migration. Bird-lover Andrew Winter, 54, had taken a break from the office when he spotted the cloud formation that resembled a bird hovering over an industrial estate. Swooping: The wispy cirrus cloud that resembled a bird was photographed over Filton in Bristol this morning . Mr Winter, 34, said: 'It was uncanny. I'd popped outside for a quick cigarette break and looked up and there it was. 'I ran back into the office and told everyone, but they didn't believe me. 'One joker asked me if I was cirrus - which of course I was.' Cirrus clouds form at very high levels in the atmosphere - above 20,000ft. The extremely cold temperatures at these levels mean the clouds are made up of ice crystals, meaning they appear thin, wispy and white. Birds including swallows and swifts usually migrate from the UK in September and October, travelling thousands of miles to Africa, Arabia and the Indian sub-continent. They can travel more than 200 miles in a day at a maximum flight speed of 17-22mph. Icarus wings: The 'bird' appeared to be on a final descent like the figure from Greek legends who died when the wax holding together his home-made wings melted when he flew too close to the sun . Flight of fancy: Andrew Winter rushed back to the office to tell his colleagues - many of whom did not believe him . The bird-shaped cloud was just one of several amazing formations that have been spotted by keen photographers and cloud-spotters. Clouds shaped like continents have been seen in recent months, as have others looking like animals such as dolphins. Thanks to smartphones, more people are able to snap the beautiful images before they disappear. Meanwhile, flocks of birds are also known to form themselves into cloud-like formations. The annual murmuration of starlings in the skies over Scotland involves thousands of the birds taking to wing to perform a mating ritual. In the display that only occurs during winter months, the starlings use their amazing sense of spatial awareness to fly in a way that deflects predators.

The Coldstream Guard was severely wounded and left disfigured, with burns to his face and body, when an enemy shell pierced his tank in April 1945 - the last month of the war. He was evacuated to the pioneering plastic surgery unit at East Grinstead, West Sussex - known as the Guinea Pig Club - where he spent three years in and out of hospital recovering alongside Battle of Britain Spitfire pilots. But undaunted by his injuries, he periodically volunteered with the British Red Cross civilian relief teams in Hamburg, West Germany, in 1947 and 1948. He joined the Young Conservatives in the final year but it was not until 1970 that he was elected as an MP - after two failed attempts in 1964 and 1966.

Robert Boscawen on the right in the boat wearing the black hat, taking part in Wells moat boat race . In 1944, Britain's normally cautious Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery proposed a bold gambit to bust through German lines at Arnhem, in Holland. He suggested British and American parachute formations drop miles behind enemy lines to create a path for the British armored forces. The Allied commanders hoped to cross the Rhine, outflank the German defenses protecting the Ruhr industrial region, and bring about the collapse of the Third Reich. It was a daring plan but the final river crossing at Arnhem could not be held by the outnumbered British paratroopers. The offensive failed to achieve its objective. Conservative parliamentary candidate for the Wells constituency James Heappey, paid tribute to the esteemed politician. He said: 'It is with great sadness that I learned of the death of the Bob Boscawen.

"Deep in the remote deserts of southern Jordan, not far from the border with Saudi Arabia, lies Wadi Rum one of the world's most stunning natural wonders. Nicknamed the Grand Canyon of the Middle East, the rugged desert area covers 720 square kilometers and comprises geographical wonders from narrow gorges to towering cliffs and massive caverns. It has provided a backdrop for science-fiction films like ""Red Planet,"" starring Val Kilmer, and Ridley Scott's ""Promotheus."" But perhaps the most famous foreigner to traverse through Wadi Rum, and put this desert on the world map, was British army officer T.E. Lawrence. Imortalized by Peter O'Toole in  the 1962 movie ""Lawrence of Arabia"", fittingly parts of the Hollywood classic were filmed in the area. But long before Hollywood celebrities and tourists descended on this UNESCO World Heritage site, its red sands have, for centuries, been the home of nomadic Bedouin shepherds. With scorching sunshine by day, cold winds at night and little to no water, the Bedouins' desert life has been all about survival. ""Most people believe that the Bedouins are living a romantic life, but in fact, it is a very tough life,"" says Yousef Zreagat, Jordan's tourism expert. Hundreds of thousands of foreigners visit Wadi Rum each year. They hire either a four-wheel drive vehicle or a camel to explore the government-protected desert. Some stay overnight in Bedouin camps, where they can enjoy traditional Bedouin meals. Famed for their hospitality, the Bedouins often invite visitors to their tent homes to share mint tea or cardamom coffee, while sitting by the fire under a starry night sky. Bedouin life in Wadi Rum is increasingly intertwined with the tourism business.  Attayak Zalabia, 45, works as a tour guide and runs a camp for visitors. At his camp site, Zalabia often prepares home-cooked traditional dishes, like zarb, marinated sheep cooked under the desert sand -- the so-called ""sand oven"" -- for his guests. It is prepared fresh, with the meat sourced from Zalabia's own flock of sheep. ""You need to choose younger sheep, or young goats,"" he says. ""The meat is softer than old sheep."" Zalabia's forefathers were among the tribesmen who fought along Lawrence in the 1916-1918  Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. But today's Bedouins are facing a new battle: preserving their culture and identity. Young boys, like Zalabia's son Zeid, prefer playing video games to tending camels and hunting, much to the chagrin of the older generation. But Zalabia insists the 10-year-old should learn the ways of the desert. ""If children grow up in the city, you sometimes find them soft,"" he says. ""And Bedouins like the boys to be strong for the desert.""","Wadi Rum, nicknamed the Grand Canyon of the Middle East, is a Unesco World Heritage site in Jordan .

"Sergio Aguero and Alexis Sanchez are inspiring awe with freakish regularity. For the Argentine, it is rocket shots from all angles. For the Chilean, it is his uncanny knack of scoring at just the right time. On Wednesday night, each delivered again. Aguero took his Premier League tally to 14 goals with a double of sheer beauty at Sunderland; Sanchez reached nine with a late finish to claim victory over stubborn Southampton. Both have South American flair in spades, but it is each player’s steely resolve to win games for their team which is most impressive. Both Sergio Aguero and Alexis Sanchez (right) have been key for their teams this season . Aguero has scored 45 per cent of Manchester City’s goals in the Premier League this season. Sanchez’s strikes account for 41 per cent of Arsenal’s total. Each forward has directly won nine points through their contributions so far (goals and assists) – and are single-handedly raising their clubs up the division, as these tables show. City slump six places to eighth with Aguero out of the equation. Erase him from Manuel Pellegrini’s selections and there would be no four-goal demolition of Tottenham translating a defeat to victory, no winner against Manchester United, no rescue mission at Queens Park Rangers. Arsenal plummet even further minus Sanchez – eight places to 14th. As much as his tenacity and technique are a joy to behold, his empirical importance is what Arsene Wenger will value. He has salvaged draws from defeats against Leicester, Manchester City, and Hull – won the game at Sunderland and set his side on the path to late victory over Burnley. Sergio Aguero scored twice for Manchester City against Sunderland on Wednesday night . Aguero’s qualities are well-established – it is more than two years since Aguerooooo won the title for City – but his level right now, at 26, is approaching the heights climbed only by the best this country has seen. For impact and ingenuity, he is matching the likes of Luis Suarez, Thierry Henry and Cristiano Ronaldo. Sanchez has taken to English football with an ease that is not necessarily guaranteed by a large transfer cheque. Aged 25, he is still on an upward curve, making his £30million fee last summer appear ever more a bargain as each defining goal hits the back of the net. Even after only 14 Premier League games, it is clear the final finishing positions of City and Arsenal will be determined by the form and fitness of two men measuring 5ft 8in and 5ft 7in. Size doesn’t matter, goals do. Sanchez scores Arsenal's winner against Southampton at the end to secure all three points . Sanchez celebrates as he netted his ninth goal of the season . Diego Costa has scored 11 goals for Chelsea since joining from Atletico Madrid in the summer . P.S. Diego Costa, on 11 goals, separates Aguero and Sanchez in second at the top of the scoring charts. He has stormed into this league but is not as individually important as the other two. Without his goals and assists Chelsea would still be first, such is their supremacy and spread of contributors. Five points fewer, but still No 1.","Sergio Aguero has scored 14 goals for Manchester City this season .

"A yacht carrying around £40million of cocaine headed for the UK has been seized after a dramatic chase off the Caribbean island of Martinique. The vessel - SY Hygeia of Halsa - was boarded by French customs and two men from Jersey have been arrested after officers discovered around 250kg of the Class A drug. It followed an investigation involving the Metropolitan Police, their French counterparts and officials from the National Crime Agency (NCA). The SY Hygeia of Halsa (pictured) was intercepted as it began a transatlantic crossing and found to be carrying cocaine with a street value of around £40 million . Two men from Jersey, aged 57 and 42, were arrested and could face prosecution by the French authorities . They had been following a London-based organised crime group, with connections to the Caribbean, suspected of being involved in the large-scale importation of class A drugs. Officers accosted the UK-registered ship  off the island of Martinique on Monday as it began a transatlantic crossing. Two men, aged 57 and 42, were arrested and now face possible prosecution by the French authorities. Hank Cole, the NCA's head of international operations, said: 'Together we have stopped a huge consignment of cocaine close to source. 'We have no doubt that without this intervention the drugs would have ended up on the streets of the UK where, after being cut, they would have had a likely potential value of between £30-40 million.

Detective Superintendent Neil Thompson said: 'It is clear that the drugs recovered would have been distributed throughout the streets of London and beyond, generating further criminality and fuelling gang activity. 'If you deal in drugs in any scale we will find you, we will arrest you, and you will face the consequences of your actions.' This is the second significant seizure of Class A drugs on a sailing vessel destined for the UK in recent weeks.

"(CNN) -- An Oklahoma judge entered not guilty pleas Monday for two men accused of killing three people in a shooting spree in a predominately African-American neighborhood in Tulsa this month, according to an attorney for one of the suspects. Jake England and Alvin Watts face murder and hate crime charges in connection with the April 6 shootings that also left two people wounded. They appeared before a judge via a video link from jail to hear the charges against them, said Clark Brewster, England's attorney. Neither of the men, who are being held without bond, spoke. Watts was assigned a public defender, Brewster said. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for May 30. Authorities say England and Watts went into a largely African-American section of Tulsa shortly after midnight and gunned down apparent strangers at four locations. Two men and one woman died after being shot in the chest, while two others were shot and survived. All the shooting victims are black. Police have identified Watts and England as white, though a probable cause affidavit released Friday noted England was co-owner of a truck that had Cherokee Nation license plates. England confessed to shooting three people, while Watts admitted to police that he shot the other two, both of them fatally, according to police documents. On Friday, Tulsa County District Attorney Tim Harris filed, against both men, three counts of first-degree murder tied to the deaths of Bobby Clark, 54, Dannaer Fields, 49, and William Terrell Allen, 31. They also face two counts of shooting with intent to kill related to the two people who were wounded, according to the press release from the district attorney's office. In addition, the men face five counts of malicious harassment. The district attorney notes that, according to Oklahoma law, that charge infers that a person has acted ""maliciously and with the specific intent to intimidate or harass another person because of that person's race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin or disability."" The charge is equivalent to a hate crime under Oklahoma law, according to Partners Against Hate, a joint project of the Anti-Defamation League, the Leadership Conference Education Fund and the Center for Preventing Hate nonprofit groups. If found guilty on the murder charges, England and Watts could be sentenced to death or to life in prison. The maximum sentence for each charge of shooting with intent to kill is life in prison. First Assistant District Attorney Doug Drummond said in a press release that the prosecution is likely to decide whether to seek the death penalty after the preliminary hearing is complete. CNN's Carma Hassan contributed to this report.","Jake England and Alvin Watts face murder and hate crime charges .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:19 EST, 13 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 09:27 EST, 13 January 2014 . The driver of the train that derailed in New York last month, killing four people and injuring dozens more, had consistently been working a demanding overtime schedule in the years leading up to last month’s fatal derailment, payroll records have shown. William Rockefeller, who has been suspended without pay since the crash, worked an average of 762 overtime hours per year in 2010, 2011 and 2012, according to MTA data. On the basis that Metro-North drivers work a typical 40-hour work week of five eight-hour shifts, that's the equivalent of working a sixth day every week for three years straight. William Rockefeller, who has been suspended without pay since the Metro-North crash in early December, has worked an average of six days a week for the past three years . The reliance on overtime scheduling along the Metro-North line has been described as ‘shocking’ by U.S. Rep. Eliot Engel,  a Democrat who represents the Bronx district where the train derailed. As well as requesting payroll records for Rockefeller, NBC New York also requested information for 20 of the highest paid Metro-North engineers in 2010, 2011 and 2012. They found that one train operator worked 1,183 overtime hours in 2011, which works out to an average of 23 hours of overtime every week. Another top overtime earner made a staggering $71,000 in overtime on top of $98,000 in regular pay in 2011. That works out to 1,222 overtime hours in a single year or the equivalent of working eight days a week. Horrifying: The high-speed train derailment that killed four people has led the MTA to adopt several new safety measures . The records show that Rockefeller earned almost $45,000 in overtime pay in 2012, almost double the $23,000 average for Metro-North engineers that year. Union rules allow the most senior Metro-North train operators to have first claim on overtime hours, but this can lead to a handful of veteran engineers working extreme loads of overtime, while others get relatively few extra shifts. Engel has said that he will ask the federal government to make recommendations on reforming overtime rules for train operators. ‘It may be that people will have to be hired, because obviously if there are shifts people are working - all kinds of hours, day-in, day-out, month-in, month-out, year-in, year-out – it’s not good for anybody,’ he said. An MTA spokesman stressed to NBC that Metro-North fully complies with hours of service rules enforced by the Federal Railroad Administration. Union rules allow the most senior Metro-North train operators to have first claim on overtime hours, but this can lead to a handful of veteran engineers working extreme loads of overtime . Rockefeller claims he fell into 'a hypnosis-like daze' when his train ran off the rails along a curve on the outskirts of New York while travelling at 82 mph at the beginning of December. His lawyer Jeffrey Chartier said the engineer experienced a nod or ‘a daze,’ almost like road fatigue or the phenomenon sometimes called highway hypnosis. He couldn't say how long it lasted. What Rockefeller remembers is ‘operating the train, coming to a section where the track was still clear - then, all of a sudden, feeling something was wrong and hitting the brakes,’ Chartier said. ‘... He felt something was not right, and he hit the brakes.’ He called Rockefeller ‘a guy with a stellar record who, I believe, did nothing wrong.’ ‘You've got a good guy and an accident,’ he said. ‘... A terrible accident is what it is.’ Rockefeller ‘basically nodded,’ said Anthony Bottalico, leader of the rail employees union, relating what he said the engineer told him. ‘He had the equivalent of what we all have when we drive a car,’ Bottalico said. ‘That is, you sometimes have a momentary nod or whatever that might be.’ In the wake of the crash, investigators quickly determined that the deadly train derailment was not caused by any technical problems with the train itself as the driver had originally claimed.","Pay records show William Rockefeller had worked the equivalent of six days a week for three years .

Michele Bachmann has released a family portrait styled like the poster for Downton Abbey. The former Republican presidential candidate posted the picture of her family on her Twitter account but gave no explanation for why they were dressed in black tie attire or when the photo was taken. And considering the acclaimed series' fourth season premiered last Sunday, the reference is either five days too late for the first episode or two days too early for the second. Best guess: Congresswoman Michele Bachmann posted this family portrait on Thursday . The Bachmann's imitation of the Crawley family looks like a fair interpretation but two key components are missing: any staff and a grand manor house in the background. Instead of taking their unusual portrait in front of their Minnesota home, the politician's family apparently decided that the January temperatures were not befitting the bare arms that the ladies had as a result of their sleeveless gowns. Mrs Bachmann stands next to her husband Marcus and is flanked by their five children- Lucas, Harrison, Elisa, Caroline, and Sophia. The eighth person in the photo is Christine Griffin, who is dating Lucas. Inspiration: A large staff and massive estate were two of the missing parts in the Bachmann's version . Though Mrs Bachmann shared the photo on Twitter yesterday, it was actually her daughter Sophia who posted it originally to her Facebook profile with the caption 'Bachmann Abbey'. Many commentators praised Sophia's posting, saying that it was 'fantastic' and hilarious, while the comments were much more harsh on Mrs Bachmann's Twitter post. Some likened it to the promo photos for Keeping Up With The Kardashians, RuPaul's Drag Race, My Strange Addiction, Will & Grace, and American Horror Story.","Congresswoman Michele Bachmann shared this family portrait on Thursday .

"By . Chris Pleasance . John David Martinez, 68, was caught by police in just five hours after robbing a bank without a mask, wearing a T-shirt with his first name on it, and driving his own car to the crime scene . When robbing a bank, most thieves opt for a balaclava or at least a pair of tights over their heads to protect their identity. But one clueless criminal in Denver was caught by police after holding up a branch of Wells Fargo without a mask - while he was also wearing a t-shirt with his first name written on the front. As an added help for detectives, 68-year-old John David Martinez even drove a car registered in his name to the stick-up. The poorly-planned raid happened on Tuesday at 9am when Martinez drove his silver Honda sedan to a branch of Wells Fargo bank in Denver, Colorado, at around 9am before walking inside and speaking to a female teller. After she greeted him, Martinez said: 'This is a robbery, give me the money.' According to ABC 7News Denver, Martinez handed her a dark zip-up bag and asked her to fill it with notes, before asking her to pass it to another teller who did the same. It is claimed Martinez then took the bag back, walked out of the bank, and drove away in his Honda. He was arrested just five hours later by police who ran his number plate through a computer, got his driving licence photo and matched it to CCTV from the bank. Investigators also showed the pictures to the bank tellers, who confirmed it was the robber, before tracking Martinez' car to a Ramada Inn less than two miles away on the other side of town. After being arrested, Martinez told officers that he and his wife had been kicked out of their house three weeks prior and had moved into the hotel at the start of this week. He told detectives that he had woken up before his wife, left the room without waking her, and then used his car to drive to the bank and rob it. Martinez said he had been kicked out of his home three weeks before robbing this branch of Wells Fargo and was living in a hotel with his wife. He didn't tell her about the crime, and insisted he had borrowed the cash . When he arrived back at the hotel he said his wife was awake. Deciding not to mention the robbery, he instead told her that he had borrowed the money. Martinez was booked into Denver jail on investigation of felony robbery involving $20,000 or more, according to the Denver jail website. Martinez has prior arrests for assault with a deadly weapon, forgery, criminal impersonation, DUI hit and run and resisting arrest, according to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation.","John David Martinez, 68, arrested after robbing a bank in Denver .

"By . Alex Ward . Sometimes a bargain can be too good to be true. But frying pans that appeared online for the price of £0.00 were the exception to the rule after the company selling them gave hundreds away for free. A computer glitch at ProCook, based in Gloucester, led to the pricing blunder for the non-stick Fusion pans which normally sell for £18. Cookware company ProCook gave away 600 frying pans after incorrectly advertising them online for £0.00 . Word about the amazing offer spread quickly online and between last Friday night and Saturday afternoon six hundred customers placed orders, some ordering as many as forty pans. Retailing at £18 each, the multiple orders would have cost ProCook £50,000 to honour but the company decided to send each customer who ordered during the glitch one pan as a gesture of goodwill. Company spokeswoman Sarah Savory-Smith said: ‘We were not legally bound to supply the pans for nothing but we have decided to send one pan to each person who ordered them as a gesture of goodwill. Goodwill: The company sent each customer who ordered the 28cm non-stick frying pan for free . ‘Some people tried to order more than one, in one case there was an order for forty but we are certainly not doing that. ‘We don’t yet know how this error occurred. Suddenly on Friday night the price of these pans went down to zero. Tesco in particular has been badly hit by price glitch mistakes in the past. Just before Christmas last year a glitch at the chain's tills meant . shoppers could buy Terry's Chocolate Oranges for just 29p – a saving of . almost 90 per cent on the list price of £2.75. The mix-up happened because tills couldn't handle two simultaneous . promotions on the chocolates – a three-for-£5 offer and a . buy-one-get-one-free deal. Earlier that year, Tesco suffered yet again for a till blunder in June . 2011, when customers were walking away with 24 cans or bottles of . leading brands of lager for only £4. The promotion was supposed to offer a saving of £4 on two cases of 12 . drinks such as Carling, Fosters and  Budweiser, which normally sell for a . total of £20. But when shoppers reached the till, they were being charged only £4 instead of £16. And Tesco, again, earlier that month was caught out on another beer deal glitch. A deal offering three boxes of various alcoholic drinks for £20 was going through the tills at three for £11. ‘Luckily some of our staff were very vigilant and noticed this quickly on Saturday and were able to put it right. ‘The 28cm Fusion pan is one of our most . popular products and news about this apparent giveaway offer spread . amazingly quickly across the world thanks to various bloggers.’ An online petition of angry customers helped force M&S to honour orders for Panasonic 50 inch 3D plasma televisions after shoppers snapped up the sets for just £199 following a pricing blunder earlier this year. High street giant Next has been left red-faced after listing a pair of sofas worth £1,198 on its website for just £98. Online shoppers were delighted when they discovered the blunder, which reduced the cost of the sofas by £1,100 instead of the intended £100. But the retailer fell back on small print in its terms and conditions which it says allows it to cancel orders before they are dispatched for delivery. Next was quick to spot the error and corrected the price after just a few hours in January this year. Amazon was once blitzed by bargain hunters after it mistakenly priced music album downloads for 29p in 2009. Many customers, tipped off by consumer websites, bought scores of downloads before Amazon realised it was selling entire albums for less than the price of some of its singles. It is understood that more than 30 different albums were priced at 29p for four hours.","ProCook was forced to give away 600 frying pans after a pricing glitch online advertised it for £0.00 .

By the time he was in the grind of the fourth set, Wawrinka was talking directly to a fan who was bothering him, turning toward the Arthur Ashe Stadium stands and saying: 'Shut up, man! Seriously, shut up.' Once his mind was back on the tennis, Wawrinka was fine. Wawrinka said afterwards: 'It was comfortable, because I was playing really good tennis. I think I was serving big. I was moving really well and taking the ball early, dictating every point. That's why it (looked) like - not easy, but it (looked) good for me.' Onward bound: Wawrinka will now meet Slovenia's Blaz Kavcic, who upset 30th seed Jeremy Chardy . Bellucci, a left-hander, was ranked as high as No 21 in 2010, but arrived in New York with a record of only 11-10 this season. He entered the match with a 5-19 record against opponents ranked in the top 10, including 0-9 on hard courts. But after a poor start, he began giving Wawrinka some trouble. Bellucci finally earned his first break point of the match in the fourth game of the third set. He converted the chance on a 10-stroke exchange, stumbling as he flubbed a shot that clipped a net cord, then righting himself to deliver a backhand lob winner that landed on the baseline for a 3-1 lead that helped him take that set. Wawrinka called that 'one bad game.' Flair: Thomaz Bellucci returns the ball between his legs during the second round match . And then, making things really interesting, Bellucci went up a break at 2-1 in the fourth set. But Wawrinka was able to break back to get back on serve. At 5-4 in the fourth set, Wawrinka held two match points, but Bellucci saved them to hold serve there and get to 5-5. With a chance to force a fifth set, though, Bellucci faltered in the tie-breaker. 'I tried to focus more on my game and not on what he was doing,' Wawrinka said in an on-court interview. 'Tried to make him work a lot. I was playing a little bit smarter at the end of the match.' Wawrinka made a real breakthrough at Flushing Meadows last year, eliminating defending champion Andy Murray and getting to his first major semi-final in the 35th Grand Slam tournament of his career. He has now reached the third round of the US Open for the fourth time in the past five years. Wawrinka's next opponent is 92nd-ranked Blaz Kavcic of Slovenia, who eliminated 30th-seeded Jeremy Chardy of France 6-2, 6-7 (6-1), 6-3.

"(CNN) -- North Korea fully reopened its border to South Koreans on Tuesday, without explaining its reversal, the South's Unification Ministry said. Cross-border gates between North and South Korea were closed on March 9. The communist nation shut its border on March 9, calling 12-day U.S.-South Korean military exercises a threat to its safety. But on Tuesday, North Korea normalized visits by South Korean workers and cargo trucks to an industrial complex jointly run with the South, Yonhap said. ""The North Korean side sent us a letter of approval this morning,"" the news agency quoted Unification Ministry official Lee Jong-joo as saying. The letter did not explain the North's reversal, Lee told Yonhap. Two batches of workers, totaling 287 people, crossed the border into North Korea on Tuesday, according to the Unification Ministry. More than 300 were scheduled to return at the end of the workday. North Korea had partly opened its border Monday, allowing nearly 300 South Koreans to return home. Many of the South Koreans work at the industrial complex in the North Korean border town of Kaesong. The border closing was part of a recent series of aggressive moves by North Korea, which included cutting the last remaining communications channel between North and South; saying that the North could not guarantee the safety of South Korean passenger jets in its airspace during the annual joint military exercises; and threatening to retaliate if a ""satellite"" launch from its northeastern coast was intercepted, saying interference would ""mean a war."" U.S. and South Korean officials have said that North Korea appears to be preparing to test-fire its long-range missile, the Taepodong-2, under the guise of launching a satellite into space. The missile is thought to have an intended range of about 4,200 miles (6,700 kilometers) that, if true, could give it the capability of striking Alaska or Hawaii.","NEW: North Korea fully reopens its border to South Koreans without explanation .

"Doha, Qatar (CNN) -- An international donors conference on reconstruction and development in Darfur ended Monday with donors pledging nearly $3.7 billion toward ""recovery, reconstruction and development of Darfur during six years."" The bulk of the pledges come from a commitment made by the Sudanese government to contribute $2.65 billion. The state of Qatar announced that it pledged $500 million, and the European Union said it would commit $35 million. The United States, which currently is the biggest donor to Darfur through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), said it would not make any new financial commitment and expressed concern over the deteriorating security situation in Darfur. The 40 countries participating in the conference overwhelmingly expressed support for the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur as a base for peace in Darfur. Violence broke out in Darfur, a region of Sudan, in 2003 when non-Arab rebel groups took up arms against the central government in Khartoum, accusing it of neglect and discrimination. In response, the government of Sudan unleashed a massive counterinsurgency using militias known as the janjaweed. The violence that followed has led to the deaths of 300,000 people, according to United Nations figures from 2008. The Sudanese government says that 10,000 have died. The International Criminal Court as a result indicted Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide allegedly committed in Darfur. One rebel group, the Liberation and Justice Movement signed a peace agreement with the Sudanese government in 2011 known as the Doha Document for Peace, but progress on the deal has been slow. Three other rebel groups have refused to sign the document. On Sunday, a splinter group from the Justice and Equality Movement, the largest Darfurian rebel group, signed a ""final peace agreement"" with the Sudanese government.","Violence broke out in Darfur, a region of Sudan, in 2003 .

"The troubled inquiry into historic child abuse is facing fresh criticism after it emerged that panel members were told what to say to MPs by a long-serving Home Office official. Experts and abuse survivors were given a 23-page document advising them how to answer ‘difficult questions’ when they appeared before a high-profile committee, prompting fears that the huge Government-ordered investigation is not independent. It can also be revealed that the woman in charge of administration for the inquiry was seconded from the Home Office, where she has worked for 36 years – even though the department is at the centre of many of the allegations of cover-ups and VIP paedophile rings. Police watchdog Dru Sharpling (left) and academic Jenny Pearce were emailed a 23-page document outlining key kessages, key facts, and a chronology to use when they were quizzed by Labour MP Keith Vaz (right) Last night critics said it was yet another blow to the reputation of the inquiry, which has barely begun work more than six months after it was announced. Baroness Butler-Sloss and Fiona Woolf both had to quit as chairman over conflicts of interest, with the replacement due to be announced this week. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We are concerned that members of the secretariat, who have been seconded from the Home Office, have told witnesses what to say.’ He led the questioning of police watchdog Dru Sharpling and academic Jenny Pearce when the panellists appeared before his committee last month to discuss the turmoil. Internal emails now reveal that the two witnesses had been given detailed ‘key messages’, ‘key facts’ and a ‘chronology’ to learn, as well as instructions on ‘difficult questions’. It is just the latest blunder to hit the inquiry, after Fiona Woolf (left) and Baroness Butler-Sloss (right) were forced to resign as chairman over possible conflicts of interest . The email was sent by Angela Kyle, ‘head of secretariat’ for the inquiry, who is effectively running its administration. She has been a Home Office employee since October 1978, a time when the department was allegedly giving funding to the Paedophile Information Exchange. The late Leon Brittan was criticised for failing to outlaw PIE when he was Home Secretary in the 1980s and for not taking action on a dossier of alleged high-profile child abusers. Responses given by panel members to the Home Affairs Committee on January 16 matched the answers suggested in advance by Mrs Kyle, including those on questions on whether the panel was going to be disbanded and who should chair the inquiry. A spokesman for the inquiry said: ‘There was no coaching of panel members, but advice was legitimately given.’","Dru Sharpling and Jenny Pearce given document before being grilled .

"Jessica Devins, a photographer and graphic designer from Minneapolis, Minnesota, came up with a lovely way to announce to her husband that they were expecting. Posing in a pizzeria photo booth, a tradition that tracks back to their first date, Jessica had planned the ultimate surprise - several months in the making. In order to truly trick her man and ensure he wouldn't be suspicious, the mum-to-be had started taping her iPhone to the front wall of photo booths to capture video of their silly faces months earlier. Jessica Devins came up with an adorably unique way to announce to her husband that the pair are expecting . In a pizzeria photo booth, Jessica snuck in a newborn-sized 'Baby' beanie to tell her husband the big news . It all starts when her husband asks which face he should make for the photo capture, to which his wife replies coyly, ‘Smiling first, I don’t know. Just wing it.’ Then, as the couple grin for the camera, she sneakily holds up a knit baby hat for all to see. As her husband goes in for the next pose, she turns the hat, which reads ‘Baby’ across it towards him. Photo booths are of special significance to the couple, who have been posing in them since their first date . To ensure her man stayed clueless, she began filming their photo booth snaps with her iPhone months earlier . Her husband's response was appropriately heartwarming, complete with tears, kisses and incredulous smiles . ‘For real?’ he asks, seemingly shocked, as she laughs and nods.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Shiite Houthi rebels have overrun a tribal stronghold in northern Yemen after weeks of fighting that has left scores dead, tribal leaders said Sunday. Leaders of the Sunni Hashid tribe said Houthi fighters managed to break through their defense lines in the al-Khamri district in Amran. ""Al-Ahmar tribesmen were surrounded by hundreds of Houthi militants who attacked using heavy artillery for seven continuous hours starting last night,"" said Ali Al-Suraimi, a leader within the Hashid tribe, referring to Hashid tribal leaders. ""Hundreds of additional Houthi fighters reinforced those attacking the al-Ahmar fighters. They easily outnumbered the al-Ahmar tribesmen and this was key for the Houthis' success on the ground."" He said the Hashid tribesmen had evacuated their stronghold on Sunday morning. ""The Hashid tribes are expected to regroup, and this is far from over,"" Al-Suraimi said. Another Hashid tribal leader echoed this. On Friday, at least 42 people were killed and more than a dozen injured in clashes between Houthi militants and Hashid fighters in Amran province, which is about 30 miles north of the capital, Sanaa, and seen as a linchpin to controlling the region, officials said. President Abdurabu Hadi has dispatched a committee to discuss a cease-fire with Houthi leaders and persuade them to leave the area, according to state-run media. Cease-fire talks . Cease-fire negotiations were already under way to put an end to the fighting that has plagued Yemen since late last year, spurred in part by a power vacuum left by the departure of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Tensions between the rebel Houthis and the Hashid tribe, which includes Sunni tribesmen and conservative Islamic Salafists, began to rise last October, when the Houthis blamed the Hashid for standing behind the killing of one of their members. At least 240 people from both sides have been killed since the beginning of January in the fighting. Hundreds of civilians have evacuated their towns in Amran. Yemen is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, believed by many analysts to be the most dangerous affiliate of the terror network. Separately on Sunday, Yemeni officials said armed tribesmen kidnapped a German national in Sanaa. Kidnapping has long been a problem in Yemen, with tribes often using foreign nationals as bargaining chips in their dealings with the central government. But the past 24 months have proven even more dangerous for foreigners.

"Yeosu, South Korea (CNN) -- An unassuming town on the southern tip of South Korea is an unlikely place for one of the world's most advanced buildings. Until August 12 the city of Yeosu is hosting Expo 2012 and among the new buildings containing educational displays on ocean conservation is the Korea pavilion. It stands out as one of the most technologically advanced, if aesthetically underwhelming, of them all. Korean architecture firm Samoo Architects & Engineers designed it to resemble the Korean 'Taegeuk' -- the yin and yang symbol of balance -- but inside the structure that concept of harmony is taken even further. At a cost of around $19.5 million it combines the latest in hydrogen fuel cell technology, photovoltaic solar panels and geo-thermal energy to provide power, cooling and heating, making it carbon negative --taking out more CO2 from the atmosphere than it produces. Korean firm Hyundai provided the fuel cells that are key to the company's development of next generation hydrogen-fuelled cars, while architects from Samoo say that other engineering elements, like the seawater thermal pipes, are there to demonstrate their potential future use. While Expos have long been associated with experimental and iconic architecture -- the World's Fair of 1889 gave Paris the Eiffel Tower -- not much of it has stood the test of time. The Korea pavilion however will be one of the few structures that remains on the site once the Expo has ended. Another is the Theme Pavilion that tests architectural and engineering limits in a different way from its national namesake, by being as low-tech as possible. The Austrian architects were not even sure that the structure could even be built. ""The biomimetic principles (of the building) had not been built before on that scale,"" said Kristina Schinegger of Soma Architects. One vast side of the building is covered with reinforced fiberglass ""gills"" that can be opened and closed to either provide shade or ventilation. ""Really it's based on material performance; it's not a mechanism moving but the material itself, transforming,"" said Schinegger. ""It's an idea deduced from plants, how you can configure the geometry and how you can use certain characteristics (of the building) so you use less energy."" German renewable energy engineers Transsolar installed the solar panels on the roof and have designed a seawater heat exchange system that will provide additional cooling and lead to 80% of the building's energy originating from renewable sources. As well as the importance of eco-friendly elements, Schinegger says that the spirit of adventure and experimentalism, in keeping with the history of Expos, was a key part of the design process. ""The architectural scene (at Expos) at least is something where you can really see things that are being tried out. The task is not to make an envelope for a function but to do something that is an experience in itself,"" she says. ""On the one hand the architect has to do less, but on the other side much more. It has to be extraordinary, which is why architects love Expos.""","Expo 2012 in South Korea is site of cutting-edge experimental buildings .

Scroll down for video . Disappeared: Twenty-three-year-old yeshiva student Aaron Sofer has been missing since Friday when he went on a hike with a friend in the Jerusalem Forest . 'A physically, mentally and emotionally healthy young man does not go missing for 72 hours,' Dov Hirth, a spokesman for the family told the Jerusalem Post on Monday. 'The family is not satisfied with the way the search and rescue operation has been handled thus far.' Hundreds of officers and volunteers joined the search for Sofer since the alarm was first raised on Friday after he split from his friend while they were climbing in the Beit Zayit area of the Jerusalem Woods. 'The fact of the matter is we have a young man missing for no apparent reason, and it was on page 1 of all the newspapers and then the coverage just stopped,' said Hirth to the Jerusalem Post. 'This needs to continue to be a major story.' Aaron Sofer, 23, disappeared on Friday while hiking in the Jerusalem Forest with a friend who reported him missing . Last month, three Israeli's were indicted for the sickening murder of Muhammad Abu Khdeir, 16, whose burnt body was found near to where Sofer disappeared. 'This area is bordered by Jewish communities and by Arab communities, so it is very concerning,' said Meir Lichtenstein who is a member of the Lakewood Council in New Jersey, the Sofer's home town. Indeed, concern is rising amongst the Jewish community back in the United States. 'It’s scary to think what possibly could be the ramifications,' said neighbor Tzvi Meth to CBS Local.

"Sir Bradley Wiggins has announced that he has set up his own cycling team in a bid to win gold on the track at the Rio 2016 Olympics. The 2012 Tour de France winner has assembled a nine-man squad, composed entirely of British riders, and will be funded by Sky but known simply as ‘Wiggins’. Sir Bradley Wiggins is launching a new cycling team for young British talent called 'Wiggins' He is expected to make his debut for his new team in June when he tries to break the individual world hour record at the London Velodrome. ‘The whole idea of the team was to facilitate our ambitions for Rio and winning gold there,’ Wiggins told Sky Sports News. ‘It’s track-based and we have got a lot of the guys from the track programme in there so that we can stay and race and train together all year round and get exactly what we need in terms of achieving the end goal, which is winning the team pursuit in Rio.’ The team, endorsed by British Cycling, will be sponsored by Wiggins' long-time support Sky . The switch means Wiggins, who will be 36 by the time of the Rio Games and who has suggested he will retire afterwards, will not ride in the Tour de France again. Wiggins’ new team-mates include the cream of Britain’s young talent, such as Owain Doull and Jon Dibben, as well as more experienced riders such as Andy Tennant and Steven Burke, who should all be in the reckoning for the four-man team pursuit squad for Rio. Wiggins has three medals — bronze, silver and gold — in this event from the Sydney, Athens and Beijing Olympic Games, but the competition for Rio will be fierce, with no guarantee that he will make the final four. Wiggins, the 2012 Tour de France winner, says cycling has given him 'everything' and he wants to give back . ‘It’s not a given that Brad will be in the team in Rio,’ Shane Sutton, British Cycling’s technical director, said recently. ‘But when Brad gets a focus it’s very hard to knock him off track.’ The four-time Olympic champion, 34, will continue to race for Team Sky, where he has had a fractious relationship with team-mate Chris Froome, until April and his final outing will be at the Paris-Roubaix Challenge. Wiggins, who was ninth last year, believes he can be the first Brit to win the tough one-day Classic over the cobbles known as the ‘Hell of the North’. ‘Cycling has given me everything,’ he said. ‘Now I want to build something to inspire kids and to reach all those people who might be on the fringes of the sport. ‘My message is simple: if I can do it, then so can you.’ Referring to his bid to beat Matthias Brandle’s individual hour record, Wiggins added: ‘The next 12-year-old might come along that may be inspired by watching the hour record like I was inspired watching Chris Boardman win the gold in Barcelona.’ Sir Bradley Wiggins was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace in 2013 .","Sir Bradley Wiggins will launch team 'Wiggins', sponsored by Sky .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona booked a place in the European Champions League semifinals after convincingly beating AC Milan 3-1 on Tuesday, but the victory didn't come without its controversies. Inevitably, it was Barcelona's Lionel Messi who was center stage, scoring two first-half penalties -- his 50th and 51st in the competition -- that set the Catalan club on their way following the 0-0 draw in Italy last week. Milan, however, will bitterly contest both spot kicks. The first saw Messi win, and then convert, a penalty in the 11th minute after Luca Antonini clipped the diminutive striker's heels. Milan equalized through Antonio Nocerino, briefly putting the Italians through on away goals if the score stayed that way. But a second penalty was awarded after veteran Italy international Alessandro Nesta was controversially adjudged to have tugged Sergio Busquets' shirt. In the end Andrei Iniesta's second-half goal -- inevitably set up by Messi -- gave the home side a comfortable buffer and left Pep Guardiola's team on course to defend their title. The coach said both spot kicks were warranted, and came after a first leg in which Braca were denied a penalty despite Alexis Sanchez being brought down. ""They were penalties. We didn't complain in the away leg and we won't complain now,"" Guardiola said. ""Grabbing players in the area should be penalized and they are penalties. On television, it's a penalty."" The victory sets up a semifinal date with either Chelsea or Benfica, who play Wednesday, but all eyes will be on a possible ""dream final"" between Barcelon and Real Madrid in Munich on May 19. Not everyone wants to see an all-Spanish final. Bayern Munich ran out convincing 4-0 aggregate winners against French side Marseille after winning 2-0 on Tuesday at the Allianz Arena, where the final will take place. Two first-half goals from Ivica Olic put the tie beyond Marseille, giving the German side hope of enjoying home advantage next month. The Croatian striker started the match as Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes could afford to rest top scorer Mario Gomez and Dutch winger Arjen Robben, who both scored last week. Unless Cypriot underdogs APOEL Nicosia can overcome a three-goal deficit at Real Madrid on Wednesday, Bayern will likely face Jose Mourinho's side in the semifinals.","Barcelona beat Milan 3-1 to secure a Champions League semifinal spot .

"Cedar Rapids, Iowa (CNN) -- The Iowa caucuses are 16 months away, but judging from the way potential presidential candidates are visiting this state, you'd think they were next week. But White House hopefuls are taking advantage of the fact that next week is the first competitive Senate election here in decades. They're coming to campaign with the candidates early and often. Hillary Clinton's Wednesday with the Democratic Senate candidate Bruce Braley was about electing Bruce Braley. She talked almost exclusively about his bona fides, and the problems with his Republican opponent. But just the fact that she was here, helping her fellow Democrat, will score points with the local leaders and hard core party voters she will need to back her in 2016 -- especially since Iowa was the beginning of the end for her candidacy eight years ago when she came in third in the Iowa caucuses. Although this time around Clinton doesn't appear to have as much competition, other Democrats with 2016 buzz have been here too -- from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley to Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. On the much more wide open and chaotic GOP side, Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst can barely go a day without a White House hopeful next to her. The day we were with her it was Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who broke his own rule of not picking sides in GOP primaries to endorse Ernst early on, and he's been here several times since to campaign with her. ""How Iowa goes, the Senate will go. The Senate Majority may very well be decided here in Iowa this year,"" Rubio told us in an interview during one of his three campaign stops with Ernst. And though he too was careful to make his public remarks about the Senate race, helping Ernst win, pressing the flesh with Iowa voters who are used to getting to know their presidential candidates is undeniably helpful. Rubio said he has visited Iowa three or four times this midterm election year, (but who's counting) and he's hardly alone. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul have all made multiple visits to the Hawkeye state in 2014 alone. Even South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who said recently he might consider running for president, campaigned with Ernst last week despite the fact that he's on the ballot in his own state Tuesday. Paul had the good fortune of being chosen by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a powerful GOP force, to appear straight to camera in their new closing television ad here. ""If you're a freedom loving, liberty loving voter I urge you to get out and vote for Joni Ernst this Tuesday,"" Paul says in the ad. But sometimes testing the waters can be treacherous. Though Rubio received several warm greetings with not-so-veiled references to his presidential ambitions, one voter, Jan Larson, was looking for someone else -- and told him so. Larson stopped Rubio when he was working the crowd in Williamsburg, Iowa, to ask about Mitt Romney. ""Can we convince Mitt to run?"" Larson asked Rubio. ""I don't know you'll have to ask him,"" Rubio responded with a smile. ""I did,"" Larson said. CNNs Adam Levy contributed to this report.","White House hopefuls have spent recent weeks stumping for Iowa congressional candidates .

"By . Louise Eccles . UPDATED: . 02:31 EST, 13 February 2012 . It is often seen as one of the more civilised sports. But two British badminton stars could be accused of ungentlewomanly conflict after a war of words in the run up to the Olympics. Glaswegian Imogen Bankier, 24, and Bolton-born Jenny Wallwork, 25, are both competing for one mixed doubles spot this summer. Feud: Olympic badminton rivals Imogen Bankier (left) and Jenny Wallwork (right) have been serving up insults on Twitter as they compete for a place at the Games . The flare-up started on Wednesday after Miss Bankier watched TV highlights of the English National Championships. She tweeted: ‘Just watched the English nationals… why can English people not serve?!’ She insisted it had been ‘meant in a light-hearted way – not to offend’ after Gabby White, Miss Wallwork’s women’s doubles partner, called her ‘sour’. Two days later, Miss Wallwork launched her own attack, making a thinly veiled reference to her rival’s injury record. Gets heated: Bolton-born Miss Wallwork hits back at Miss Bankier's claims that the English can't serve (top) to which the Glaswegian tells her not to say something she will regret . ‘So the one with the ‘lighthearted banter’ is injured AGAIN!,’ she said. ‘I’d go for the ropey serve any day ;-) #banter’, and ‘Could have guessed to be honest, your [sic] usually crippled. #weak.’ The Scotswoman responded that the meaning of banter was ‘playful, intelligent, original’, adding ‘calling me a cripple… none of the above. #jog on #bored.’ She also warned her rival to not to ‘say something you regret’, followed by the word ‘spite’. Undeterred, Miss Wallwork retaliated: . ‘Slating English players none of the above either. I suggest u keep your . ‘banter’ to yourself or ‘jog on’ back to Scotland.’ Vying for 2012: Miss Bankier (left) and mixed-doubles partner Chris Adcock (right) are 14th in the world rankings . Rivals: Miss Wallwork (left) and her partner Nathan Robertson are 18th in the world. The team ranked highest in May is likely to be selected for the Olympics . Miss Bankier and her mixed doubles partner Chris Adcock are currently 14th in the world and have the edge over Miss Wallwork and her partner Nathan Robertson, in 18th place. Whichever team is ranked higher in May, is likely to be selected for the GB squad. The Glasgow-born player, who is sponsored by a whisky firm, has previously spoken out against the Badminton World Federation’s plan to force female players to wear short skirts. The BWF claimed the move was aimed at ‘raising badminton’s profile and that of women players’, but she hit back, saying: ‘I will fight to make sure this dated and simply sexist rule does not happen.’ She started playing badminton at the age of nine in what she describes as ‘very competitive Bankier family games in the back garden’. Her competitor Miss Wallwork has also played badminton since she was a child. Her mother, Jill, played for England, while her father Brian was a badminton coach. When Miss Wallwork paired up with Mr Robertson, 34, in 2008, he joked that he had ‘upgraded to a younger model’ after his long-term doubles partner Gail Emms retired from the sport.","Glaswegian Imogen Bankier: 'Why can English people not serve?!'

"To the world, he was known as ""Chespirito.""  Roberto Gomez Bolanos gained fame as a comedian, but he was also a writer, actor, screenwriter, songwriter, film director and TV producer. The legendary entertainer died Friday at the age of 85 at his home in Cancun, Mexico.  A native of Mexico City, Gomez Bolanos had been living in the resort town for the last few years due to health problems. He leaves behind his wife, Florinda Meza, also an actress and comedian, and six children from a previous marriage. Gomez Bolanos' death was confirmed by Televisa, the Mexican media conglomerate where he spent most of a career that spanned more than four decades, mainly on television. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto expressed his condolences.  ""Mexico has lost an icon whose work has transcended generations and borders,"" the President said on his Twitter account. According to his official biography, Gomez Bolanos got his nickname from a film director who, after reading something he'd written, dubbed him ""a little Shakespeare."" The term was later adapted to the more Spanish-friendly Chespirito.  The fact that he was only 5 feet 2 inches tall (1.6 meters) reinforced the nickname. Fellow actor and comedian Edgar Vivar called Gomez Bolanos ""the best writer of Spanish-language television."" Vivar, who played several Chespirito's characters, said that part of Gomez Bolanos' genius was ""that he wrote (TV shows) based on the individual actor's or actress' acting ability,"" which allowed for better and funnier comedy situations. His son Roberto Gomez Fernandez, also a TV producer, said his father had ""an extraordinary knowledge of human nature in many respects,"" which allowed his TV shows to be translated into multiple languages without losing their comedic impact. ""His ultimate intention was to entertain audiences in a wholesome way,"" Gomez Fernandez said of his father, who never used profanity or situations not appropriate for children on his shows or movies. Gomez Bolanos was born in 1929.  According to his official biography, his father was a painter, sketch artist and newspaper illustrator.  Though trained as an engineer, Chespirito never worked as one, choosing instead to write for TV and radio shows and screenplays starting in the mid-1950s. By 1968, Gomez Bolanos was already writing for his own show, and by 1971, he had developed two of his most famous TV characters. In ""El Chapulin Colorado"" (""The Red Grasshopper""), Chespirito dressed in a red bodysuit and wore vinyl antennae.  A parody of superheroes like Batman and Superman, the Red Grasshopper had certain powers, like the ability to shrink. ""El Chavo del Ocho"" (""The Boy from Number Eight"") was an orphan boy from a working-class Mexico City neighborhood. By 1973, both TV series were popular throughout Latin America. ""While the parents of my friends went to work building houses or to hospitals or attorneys' offices, my dad would dress in all red, wore antennae and went to work,"" Gomez Fernandez said. ""It was kind of normal to me.  As I grew up, I started to realize how relevant his work was."" Televisa said Chespirito's TV shows ""were watched in Mexico, just like they were watched in Brazil, Thailand or Russia.""  According to Televisa, ""El Chavo del Ocho"" has been dubbed into 50 languages. Chespirito's last show was produced in 1995, but his catchphrases and sayings continue to be part of Mexican culture. El Chapulin Colorado has also been profiled in the American TV series ""The Simpsons."" His first message on Twitter on May 28, 2011, was ""siganme los buenos,"" or ""follow me, those of you who are good,"" a phrase that he constantly used on his shows and that many people still use in Mexico and elsewhere.

"By . Mark Prigg . Music lessons as a child could improve your brainpower for life, researchers have revealed. Researchers found that children who undertook early musical training were better at quickly processing and retaining information and problem solving. Musically trained children had to have played an instrument for at least two years in regular private music lessons. Researchers found that children who undertook early musical training were better at quickly processing and retain information and problem solving: This image shows functional MRI imaging during mental task switching: Panels A and B shows brain activation in musically trained and untrained children, respectively. Panel C shows brain areas that are more active in musically trained than musically untrained children. Gaab and colleagues compared 15 musically trained children, 9 to 12, with a control group of 12 untrained children of the same age. Musically trained children had to have played an instrument for at least two years in regular private music lessons. On average, the children had played for 5.2 years and practiced 3.7 hours per week, starting at the age of 5.9. The researchers similarly compared 15 adults who were active professional musicians with 15 non-musicians. Both control groups had no musical training beyond general school requirements. The controlled study using functional MRI brain imaging was undertaken by researchers at Boston Children's Hospital. 'Since executive functioning is a strong predictor of academic achievement, even more than IQ, we think our findings have strong educational implications,' said Nadine Gaab, who led the research. 'While many schools are cutting music programs and spending more and more time on test preparation, our findings suggest that musical training may actually help to set up children for a better academic future.' Executive functions are the high-level cognitive processes that enable people to quickly process and retain information, regulate their behaviors, make good choices, solve problems, plan and adjust to changing mental demands. Gaab and colleagues compared 15 musically trained children, 9 to 12, with a control group of 12 untrained children of the same age. Musically trained children had to have played an instrument for at least two years in regular private music lessons.

The researchers say 'our findings suggest that musical training may actually help to set up children for a better academic future' The researchers similarly compared 15 adults who were active professional musicians with 15 non-musicians. Both control groups had no musical training beyond general school requirements. Since family demographic factors can influence whether a child gets private music lessons, the researchers matched the musician/non-musician groups for parental education, job status (parental or their own) and family income. The groups, also matched for IQ, underwent a battery of cognitive tests, and the children also had functional MRI imaging (fMRI) of their brains during testing. On cognitive testing, adult musicians and musically trained children showed enhanced performance on several aspects of executive functioning. On fMRI, the children with musical training showed enhanced activation of specific areas of the prefrontal cortex during a test that made them switch between mental tasks. These areas, the supplementary motor area, the pre-supplementary area and the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, are known to be linked to executive function. 'Our results may also have implications for children and adults who are struggling with executive functioning, such as children with ADHD or [the] elderly,' says Gaab. 'Future studies have to determine whether music may be utilized as a therapeutic intervention tools for these children and adults.""","Could boost calls for more music training in schools .

"(CNN)  -- Richard Strandlof said he survived the 9/11 attacks on the Pentagon. He said he survived again when a roadside bomb went off in Iraq killing four fellow Marines. He'd point to his head and tell people he had a metal plate, collateral damage from the explosion. Richard Strandlof says he didn't mean to cause harm when he lied about being a military veteran. Crowds ate up his story. He canvassed Colorado appearing at the sides of politicians. Inspiring and seemingly authentic, he spoke on behalf of veterans at the state Capitol. It turns out the whole thing was a lie. He wasn't at the Pentagon. He was never a Marine. He never served his country. He never graduated from the Naval Academy. He claimed his name was Rick Duncan. He formed a group called the Colorado Veterans Alliance, and the FBI is now investigating whether he embezzled money as a result.  Watch Strandlof defend himself » . Where was he on 9/11, the day he said he witnessed heroism firsthand? ""I was in San Jose, California, watching it in horror on TV with a few other people,"" Strandlof told CNN's Anderson Cooper. He was at a homeless shelter at the time. Strandlof denies being a pathological liar. He says he suffered from ""some severely underdiagnosed mental illness"" and that he got caught up in the moment around ""people who are passionate and loved what they did."" He told CNN he had put on a ""production, which I'm sorry for."" ""Hopefully the people that I hurt can in some way gain closure from that, and I myself don't know what I can do short of leaving them alone and not being in their lives, to make that happen,"" Strandlof said. He said he's not sure exactly how he's hurt people. ""It's not for me to say, and time will tell,"" he said. Hal Bidlack, a former Air Force lieutenant colonel, is one of those people. He ran for Congress as a Democrat and had Strandlof appear with him. Bidlack isn't too happy. ""Once one lie fell apart, the whole series of things ... just cascaded into an ocean of lies,"" he said. Bidlack was at the Pentagon when it came under attack on September 11, 2001. He now realizes that Strandlof stole portions of his own story. ""Now that we know he's a lying fraud,"" Bidlack said, ""I think he was just parroting my own story back to me."" ""There are an awful lot of things that he kept straight to try to fool an awful lot of people for an awful long time."" Doug Sterner has catalogued hundreds of people claiming to be military veterans who never served in the military. He says it's typical for those perpetuating the hoaxes to claim mental illness. ""I don't buy that,"" Sterner said. ""What he was doing was looking for a cause to promote himself. I see this repeatedly. I've had a hundred cases just this year like Rick Strandlof's. ... What they're doing is building a kingdom of self and feeding their own ego."" Sterner has pushed for a federal database listing the names and citations of all decorated military veterans to help put an end to such cases. He said Strandlof has robbed true veterans of their veracity. ""Doing good does not take away from the bad that he did,"" he said. ""Because of Rick Strandlof, the next global war on terrorism veteran that speaks in a school or talks to the media or gets involved in politics is going to be questioned."" According to the Denver Post, Strandlof came to authorities' attention first in 1997, when he was sentenced to five years on forgery and bad-check charges. With the FBI now investigating him for fraud, he told CNN he's innocent. ""We did not take money to use on non-veterans projects. I did not enrich myself on this. I did not gain any money from this,"" he said. That's not the point, said Sterner. ""The one thing he robbed from every veteran that comes out now is credibility.""

"Carrow Road was stunned when Charlton executed a textbook smash and grab — scoring an 86th-minute goal to deal Norwich a first league defeat since the opening game of the season. Only a tiny corner of Charlton fans were united in song after a shot by Johnnie Jackson from distance was deflected off Russell Martin and beyond John Ruddy’s outstretched arm. Ruddy had only been tested once before that. ‘We’re staggered that we’ve lost,’ said Norwich manager Neil Adams. ‘We did enough to win two or three games. Except for not scoring a goal, we did everything right. I couldn’t criticise anything. Charlton captain Johnnie Jackson (left) celebrates his goal as John Ruddy sits dejected on the turf .

Attendance: 25,983 . ‘We made chances, had penalty appeals turned down and to make it even more disappointing we’ve been done and not even come away with a point. It’s a cruel game.’ Tempers spilled over after the final whistle with several players embroiled in a fracas. Charlton manager Bob Peeters dragged 17-year-old Karlan Ahearne-Grant, who was making his debut, away from a skirmish with Norwich captain Martin. ‘You don’t see him picking on Andre Bikey,’ said Peeters afterwards, referring to his defender who is built like a rugby prop forward. ‘They pick on the little one.’ Adams turned toward the dugout, hands on his chest and head tilted to the skies in through the second half when Nathan Redmond was denied, then Wes Hoolahan’s follow-up shot was cleared on the line by a scrambling Rhoys Wiggins. He must have wondered what his side had to do to win this game. They played elegant football and tested keeper Stephen Henderson several times but the Charlton defence stood resolute. Steven Whittaker of Norwich City (left) flicks the ball away from Rhoys Wiggins . Bradley Johnson shouts as his goal is disallowed for a foul on Charlton keeper Stephen Henderson . Carrow Road on Tuesday night, during Norwich's Championship game against Charlton . Adams protested after referee Michael Russell waved away a second-half penalty appeal for what seemed an obvious handball by Bikey. Earlier Russell had disallowed a goal, probably correctly, for a push on Henderson by Bradley Johnson before Martin poked the ball into the net. Norwich’s best opportunity to establish a lead came after only three minutes when Hoolahan played a tremendous ball to release Lewis Grabban. The striker had only the keeper to beat but his low shot to the left was palmed away by Henderson. Hoolahan again found Grabban in space soon after but he shot wide from distance. Charlton, one of only five sides in English football still unbeaten this season, owe much of that record to experienced defensive duo Tal Ben Haim and Bikey, who made several crucial tackles. ‘They were excellent,’ said Peeters. The former Belgium international striker said he was not considering promotion yet for Charlton. ‘If you look at the budget we have and the budget Norwich have they are very different. I was playing two 17-year-olds (Joe Gomez and Ahearne-Grant).

"Olivier Giroud is set to make his long-awaited come back from injury in the crunch clash against Manchester United. And manager Arsene Wenger has designs on pairing the Frenchman with £15million striker Danny Welbeck to form a potentially prolific strikeforce in the not too distant future. Giroud has missed three month after sustaining a freak ankle injury in the 2-2 draw against Everton at the end of September. Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud has regained fitness and is in contention to face Manchester United on Saturday . That 2-2 draw with Everton back in August was the last time the France striker appeared in an Arsenal shirt . But, as Sportsmail revealed last week, the striker is set to be named in Arsenal's squad to face Louis van Gaal's men at the Emirates Stadium. 'He (Giroud) is three or four weeks ahead of schedule. Originally we planned to have him back for competition at the beginning of next year, so he is one month ahead. 'We relied on Welbeck, and on Alexis Sanchez as well, but we have Giroud back, we have Theo Walcott back. 'Slowly they will integrate into the team again and give us different options.' Giroud's return poses a selection dilemma for Wenger given he plays with a lone striker, theoretically meaning he could be forced to choose between Welbeck and Giroud on match days. The pair have trained with each other just twice due to Giroud's long-term injury. And Wenger is keen to analyse how the pair gel as a conventional strike pairing in training, feeling it is a tactic that could be benefit his side this season. Giroud returned to training ahead of schedule having suffered a serious leg fracture back in August . However, Welbeck is expected to start as the lone striker against the club he left on transfer deadline day, with Giroud on the bench. Wenger has also revealed Mathieu Debuchy (ankle) and Laurent Koscielny (achilles) will make their returns next month. 'Koscielny and Debuchy are doing well, they are out on the field [working] again. We have to see now,' said the Arsenal boss. 'Usually field work is three weeks away from full group training, then there is fitness. It looks straightforward for Debuchy. It's not inflammation, it's just repairing surgery. Mathieu Debuchy and Gunners team-mate Giroud watched the ATP World Tour Finals in London last week .

"Michelle Smart, pictured, allegedly threatened her boyfriend with a gun after he rebuffed her sexual advances over Valentine's Weekend . A South Carolina woman was arrested over Valentine's Weekend after she threatened to shoot her boyfriend who fell asleep after spurning her sexual advances. Michelle Smart, 29, of Spartanburg, South Carolina, is alleged to have threatened Ryan Rucker with his own gun after he refused to have sex with her. Deputies from Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office arrested Smart following the incident on February 15. Smart told police that she had 'attempted to make some sexual advances toward Mr Rucker' but he 'pushed her off him'. She claimed that Mr Rucker had punched and kicked her several times and she was forced to flee the house and sat in a truck outside the $78,000 home. Smart told deputies that her boyfriend had threatened to shoot her, but she did not wish to make a statement. However, according to Deputy Castillo, he and several deputies knocked on the door of the house. In a statement, Deputy Castillo said: 'Mr Rucker came to the door and was not visibly upset. Mr Rucker explained that he was asleep when Ms Smart made sexual advances on him. He stated that he pushed her off and the tow started arguing. 'Mr Rucker stated that the argument escalated and that he followed Ms Smart outside. He stated that Ms Smart got into the truck and that she would shoot him because she has the gun.' Mr Rucker told deputies that he went back into the house because he was in fear for his life, although he did not wish to make a formal complaint against his girlfriend.' According to Deputy Castillo: 'Ms Smart continually was changing her story throughout the investigation. She advised that Mr Rucker had gone walking away when in fact he was inside the house. She stated that she thought he had the gun, and tournd out that the gun in question was in her presence the entire time. 'For these reasons, Ms Smart's account became less believable throughout the investigation.' Deputy Castillo said he arrested Smart for Criminal Domestic Violence of High and Aggravated nature. Deputy Castillo said he recovered Mr Rucker's Ruger hand gun and six bullets and placed them into evidence.

"If an airline loses or delays your bag, can you trust it to let you know how much money you're entitled to? One passenger says don't count on it. She's suing Delta Air Lines for breach of contract, alleging that the carrier leaves fliers in the dark about the compensation they're entitled to when their bags vanish. The U.S. Department of Transportation requires airlines to pay up to $3,300 per passenger if bags are ""lost, damaged, delayed or pilfered"" on a domestic flight. But lawyers for Susan Miller say Delta ""uniformly and systematically"" ignores this rule and often tells passengers they are only entitled to $25 to $50 a day in expenses. Delta has not responded to a request for comment, but it's not the first time the company has faced this complaint: Last year, the DOT fined the airline $100,000 for failing to comply with the government rule. Miller, a Florida resident, says she flew on Delta from Miami to Las Vegas in November of 2010. When she arrived at her destination, Miller discovered that the airline had lost her baggage, leaving her without any warm clothes or essentials, according to a class action complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in Southern Florida earlier this month. Miller then had to spend more than $315 to buy replacement toiletries, medication and other items, but when she raised the issue with Delta, she was told nothing could be done to help her, the court documents say. The bag turned up a couple of days later, her attorney David  Tucker said. DOT spokesman Bill Mosley declined to comment on this specific case, but said in general, carriers are not supposed to limit compensation when passengers are forced to buy essentials after their bags are delayed. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood has echoed this sentiment in the past. ""Travelers should not have to pay for toiletries or other necessities while they wait for baggage misplaced by airlines,"" LaHood said in a 2009 memo warning airlines not to improperly limit reimbursements. A few weeks after her flight, Miller made a claim with Delta for her expenses, which was ""rejected and/or ignored,"" her lawyers say. ""What happened to (Miller) happens every day to Delta passengers whose bags are delayed,"" the complaint alleges. ""Such tactics allow Delta to pocket millions and millions it would have had to pay out if it had abided by its contracts with passengers."" Miller is suing on behalf of herself and other Delta passengers who have found themselves in a similar situation. The class action is asking for a jury trial to award direct, compensatory and punitive damages.","Passenger says Delta lost her bag, then did nothing when she spent $315 for necessities .

"(CNN) -- Burt Reinhardt, a television pioneer who helped lead the evolution of 24-hour news coverage as president of CNN, died Tuesday at 91, according to family members. Reinhardt died in Georgia, according to his daughter, Cheryl Reinhardt. She said he had been suffering complications following a series of strokes earlier this year. Cable News Network founder Ted Turner remembered Reinhardt, who stayed away from the limelight, as an influential, if taciturn, executive. ""We both wanted to run a great news organization,"" Turner said. ""He just did a masterful job. He got the stories covered, but he did it within the budget."" After a stint as a vice president, Reinhardt served as CNN president from 1983 to 1990. He later was vice chairman of the organization until his retirement in 2000. Former CNN chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour said Reinhardt was a leader who made the trains run on time. ""He had a steely demeanor, but had a heart of gold,"" said Amanpour, who said Reinhardt hired her as a producer-reporter in New York after she pleaded her case. ""I'm not sure CNN would be here without him,"" said Turner, who launched CNN in 1980. His colleague was an ""integral part of getting the whole operation going and keeping it going. He ran it close to 20 years."" A native of New York, Reinhardt filmed U.S. Army Signal Corps combat footage during World War II, including Gen. Douglas MacArthur's historic return to the Philippines. Reinhardt later served as news editor for Fox Movietone News, according to his daughter. He also was vice president for United Press International Television News and executive vice president at Paramount Pictures, where he nurtured the development of home video. ""I tell people that in my opinion, he's probably the most important and powerful news executive you've never heard of,"" said nephew Harlan Reinhardt. Amanpour said Reinhardt's past as a World War II photographer helped. ""I realized there and then that this wasn't just an executive in a suit. It's a man who's been there. This is a man who's one of us. This is a man who was in the field who covered the wars and so he knew what it took to run a news operation like CNN and keep it afloat when everybody was digging its grave."" Reese Schoenfeld, who was the first president of CNN and was replaced by Reinhardt, said Reinhardt's work was pivotal to the growth of the network. ""He was a person of integrity and a great newsman,"" said Schoenfeld. ""I'm not sure that I would've had the financial discipline or the capability of doing that nearly as well as Burt did and it really saved the company -- it's the only reason CNN exists today."" Tom Johnson, who replaced Reinhardt as CNN's third president, said he developed an unusual relationship with him over the years. ""I will never forget that after Ted Turner and I reached an agreement that I would become the new president of CNN in 1990, I asked Ted, could I retain Burt Reinhardt as vice chairman of the company,"" Johnson said. ""Most new CEO's coming in do not wish to have the former CEO around. But I just felt I needed - I needed Burt."" Johnson also credited Reinhardt for steering the news organization through trying financial times. ""I'm sure a lot of people will talk about Burt's fiscal responsibility. but I think what set Burt apart from everyone else who has been at CNN was that he was quietly strong,"" said Jim Walton, president of CNN Worldwide. ""And behind the scenes, this man has integrity and he's very competitive, but he wants to do things the right way. He's fair, but firm and he treated everyone with respect."" Reinhardt helped solidify the CNN logo as a strong symbol. The logo, now commonly known as a ""bug"" in broadcast jargon, is almost always on the television screen during CNN's news coverage. This idea was the brainchild of Reinhardt. Reinhardt, who grew up in the Bronx, is survived by his wife, Diana Shaw; children, Cheryl Reinhardt of Chapel Hill, North Carolina; Gary Reinhardt of Provincetown, Massachusetts; and one grandchild. He was predeceased by son, Barry, and his identical twin, Sheldon. CNN's Richard Roth, Katie Silver and Brian Vitagliano contributed to this report.","Burt Reinhardt was a key CNN executive during the network's crucial early years .

Theodore Roosevelt: ""When they call the roll in the Senate, the senators do not know whether to answer 'present' or 'not guilty.'"" John F. Kennedy, when asked how he became a war hero: ""It was absolutely involuntary. They sank my boat."" Ronald Reagan: ""I have left orders to be awakened at any time in case of national emergency -- even if I'm in a Cabinet meeting."" Bob Dole, on the Senate: ""If you're hanging around with nothing to do and the zoo is closed, come over to the Senate. You'll get the same kind of feeling and you won't have to pay."" Bill Clinton, on the White House: ""I don't know whether it's the finest public housing in America or the crown jewel of the American penal system.'' George W.

"Jambalo, Colombia (CNN) -- The bodies of two pilots who were aboard a Colombian Air Force plane when it crashed Wednesday in a rebel zone in southwestern Colombia were retrieved Thursday. The plane had been supporting troops fighting rebels in the mountains near the town of Jambalo in Cauca province. Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia rebels said they shot down the plane; government officials said the crash may have been caused by mechanical failure. Firefighters found the remains of one of the plane's pilots at the crash site; FARC rebels had removed the body of the other pilot and turned it over to the Red Cross. After the handover, a group of about 10 FARC rebels attacked army positions, firing homemade mortars called tatucos from atop a mountain upon which a 30-foot wooden cross had been erected. The firefight lasted for about 20 minutes, before the guerrillas escaped. There were no reports of casualties. The plane had been flying over the area in order to provide security for Wednesday's visit by President Juan Manuel Santos to the nearby town of Toribio. Santos was there to meet with villagers over their demands that both government soldiers and members of the FARC leave the area. He has seen his ratings among Colombians drop in recent weeks because of the widespread perception that the security situation has gotten out of control during his leadership.

"A Texas woman who has been on death row for eight years following the 2004 death of her girlfriend's son will be executed tomorrow. Lisa Ann Coleman, 38, of Arlington, Texas, was found guilty of capital murder in the death of nine-year-old Davontae Williams, who had been beaten and bound, and whose body bore more than 250 scars when officials discovered him on July 26, 2004. He had also been starved, weighing a mere 35 pounds at the time of his death. Tragic end: Lisa Ann Coleman (left) will be executed tomorrow after being convicted of capital murder in the 2004 death of her girlfriend's son, Davontae Williams (right) Coleman's girlfriend, Marcella Williams, was also charged with capital murder and is currently serving a life sentence after reaching a plea deal in her son's death. Prosecutor's in Coleman's case used the charge of kidnapping to justify asking for the death penalty. According to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, they argued that Coleman 'did not allow Davontae to have visitors, kept him from visiting others by restraining him and told people he was not at the apartment when he was there.' The young boy's ultimate cause of death was malnutrition. Paramedics who arrived on the scene after it was reported the child was having trouble breathing found him dressed in nothing but bandages and a diaper, and reported that the boy had clearly been dead for several hours. A jury deliberated for just three hours in June 2006 before recommending the death penalty. Williams, who was just 14-years-old when she gave birth to Davontae, had been investigated by Child Protective Services seven time between 1995 and 2002. In 2002, they lost track of  the family. Life in prison: Davontae's mother, Marcella Williams (above) is serving life in prison after reaching a plea deal in the death of her son, who weighed just 35 pounds when he succumbed to malnutrition . Death row: Coleman's mugshot at the time of her initial arrest back in 2004 . Coleman’s appellate attorney, John Stickels, filed a clemency application in August asking that Texas governor Rick Perry commute her sentence to life in prison, but a board voted unanimously earlier this week to not recommend commutation. 'What she’s really guilty of is being a black lesbian,' Stickels said. 'If she is executed, it will be because of her sexual orientation. Her sexual orientation played a role in the state choosing to seek the death penalty and in her getting the death penalty.' According to The Austin Chronicle, four witnesses who lived in the same apartment complex as Williams and Coleman report seeing Davontae around the neighborhood unrestrained and in good spirits just days before his death. These witnesses all submitted affidavits on Coleman's behalf to help her attorneys as they attempted to appeal her case by questioning the legitimacy of the kidnapping charges. Coleman will be will be the sixth woman put to death in Texas since 1982, and the ninth person this year. The last woman to be executed in Texas was Suzanne Basso, who received a lethal injection on February 5, 2014.","Lisa Ann Coleman, 38, will be executed tomorrow for the death of nine-year-old Davontae Williams .

"Energy firms have robbed the average family of £145 over the past year by failing to pass on a sharp fall in wholesale prices, it is claimed today. The estimate, by consumer group Which?, equates to a total extra cost of £2.9billion. The figures paint a damning picture of the Big Six energy companies, which stand accused of lining their own pockets while customers struggle to pay bills. The firms – British Gas, SSE, Npower, E.on, EDF and Scottish Power – have announced small price reductions in recent weeks, ranging from £9 to £35 a year. Energy firms including British Gas have been  accused of lining their own pockets while customers struggle to pay bills . However, the wholesale price of gas has fallen by 28 per cent compared with a year ago, while the price of electricity is down by 15 per cent. Just last week, energy regulator Ofgem published average profit margin figures for the major suppliers, showing an increase of almost 50 per cent in the past year. The watchdog is so concerned that energy firms are failing to pass falling prices on to customers that it has ordered a wide-ranging investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). While this could change how energy firms operate in the long term, Ofgem is unable to force them to cut bills immediately. Which? tracked wholesale prices and energy bills to establish whether customers were getting a fair deal. A spokesman said: 'We analysed the costs to suppliers of buying wholesale energy since 2013 and compared this against what consumers have paid for wholesale costs through energy bills in the same period. Big Six energy firms have robbed the average family of £145 over the past year by failing to pass on a sharp fall in wholesale prices, it has been claimed . 'We found that the failure of retail prices to align with wholesale costs has cost consumers £2.9billion over the last year, an equivalent of £145 per household on standard tariffs.' Which? found that a raft of sharp price rises by firms on gas just before winter 2013 were not justified by any change in the wholesale cost. It said customers' bills have since remained high, despite continuing falls in what the firms are paying. Its figures suggest recent price cuts on gas of between 1.3 and 5.1 per cent should have been much higher – between 8.8 and 10.3 per cent – while firms could have also cut electricity prices by up to 10 per cent. The group has submitted its findings to the inquiry being carried out by the CMA and to the Treasury, which is also investigating. Which? wants the CMA to set up a new regime that will allow Ofgem to establish a 'price to beat'. This would be a gas and electricity tariff it considers fair to consumers, while also allowing the energy firms to make a decent profit. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'Our analysis places a massive question mark over how suppliers have been setting prices over the last two years. They now need to explain to their customers why bills don't fall further in response to dropping wholesale prices.' Energy firms have attempted to blame Labour for the fact that recent price cuts have been smaller than customers would like. Ed Miliband pledged to freeze prices until 2017 should Labour win the General Election, making firms reluctant to reduce tariffs. Energy UK, which speaks for the energy firms, said bills are now falling. Chief executive Lawrence Slade said: 'The Which? calculations are based on very many assumptions and do not reflect the cheaper deals we are seeing. 'Because energy companies buy ahead to fix prices and to plan … the gas and electricity we are using today has already been paid for.'","Energy firms have 'robbed' the average family of £145 over the past year .

"The father of murdered backpacker David Miller has said his son died a hero, trying to help fellow victim Hannah Witheridge. Ian Miller said last night that his ‘wonderful boy’ was probably killed attempting to save the 23-year-old. ‘It has become clearer and clearer that it is quite likely David was stepping in to help a girl who was in trouble,’ the 57-year-old, from St Helier in Jersey, said. ‘That would be absolutely in his character.’ Scroll down for video . Ian Miller said his ‘wonderful boy’ was probably killed attempting to save fellow victim Hannah Witheridge . He spoke as it emerged Miss Witheridge may have been raped by two local men before she was killed on Koh Tao island. But Thai police said they ‘still believe sexual jealousy is at the heart of this crime’. Colonel Kissana Phathanachareon cited ‘fresh evidence which could lead to a new suspect who may have had a relationship or one-night stand with Hannah or one of her friends or David’. The Bangkok Post last night reported police had narrowed their inquiry to two suspects – a Thai national and a Burmese worker. Father Ian Miller said it would be 'absolutely in his character' to try and save a girl who was in trouble . The bodies of students David Miller and Hannah Witheridge were found last Monday on Sairee Beach, Thailand . Dressed in a pink top and white skirt, Hannah Witheridge looked happy and relaxed as she strolled past fruit stands and in and out of bars . David Miller was seen walking past the same spot at a different time with two friends. He is wearing a blue and grey t-shirt and grey shorts . Police are hunting this man filmed running frantically away from the beach on the night of the murders . The bodies of the students, who were staying in the same apartment complex, were found last Monday on Sairee Beach. Miss Witheridge, from Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, was bludgeoned with a hoe found nearby while Mr Miller, 24, was battered with an unknown ‘metal weapon’. DNA from Miss Witheridge’s body came from two Asian men – but did not match any of 12 suspects. It is claimed she may have spoken with her attackers before being dragged to her death, with Mr Miller killed after coming to her aid. Officers said it appeared one killer had left his blue shorts at the scene, putting on Mr Miller’s ‘better quality’ beige pair. Last night James Isaacs, a tourist, claimed two British women were recently mugged by a Thai motorbike gang at the spot where the bodies were found. Mr Miller, a businessman, said the family has not been kept informed by Thai police. He added: ‘We have had very little information here about how they are getting on there. We know they are busy but we haven’t got any inside track.’ What can the DNA tell us? DNA found on Miss Witheridge’s body is thought to be from two Asian men. One of the men’s DNA was found on a cigarette butt. What about CCTV? Mr Miller and Chris Ware were filmed leaving a bar at 12.55am. Mr Ware told police they returned to Ocean View guesthouse. Mr Miller went out again at 1am to buy cigarettes, he said. Another friend said Mr Miller ended up in AC nightclub with Miss Witheridge and a friend. What happened next? CCTV shows Mr Miller walking towards Ocean View alone. There is no more footage of Miss Witheridge. She may have walked on the beach and met her killers. Police do not know if she saw Mr Miller or if he heard her scream. What were the weapons? The killers appear to have found a garden hoe and a metal bar lying near the beach. The metal bar has not yet been located by police. What mistakes have Thai police made? The island was not locked down quickly after the bodies were found. Crime scene was not taped off, and full statements not taken from friends. Many conflicting statements by police. Chances of finding killers shrinking rapidly.","The father of murdered backpacker David Miller has said his son died a hero .

"On February 1, deadly riots at a football match in Port Said plunged Egypt into mourning and despair. The national league was canceled and the future of one of African soccer's traditional powerhouses seemed bleak. However, a tiny bit of that gloom lifted just weeks later when Ahmed Hassan made history by making his 179th international appearance -- a new world record that gave a glimmer of hope in a time of turmoil. But, as he prepares to continue the Pharaohs' rebuilding phase, Hassan says that Egypt -- a country where sport and politics are inextricably linked -- faces a long road to recovery before it can resolve its problems and move out of a ""dark tunnel."" ""The whole country is suffering from a lack of ethics, as well as a general lack of security, and this is causing problems in all facets of life,"" the 36-year-old told the official website of world football's governing body FIFA. ""There is no doubt that football will bounce back but the whole country has to make it out of this dark tunnel. Stability will only return when all members of the community, whether they be players, fans, referees, journalists or security staff, recognize their role, stick to it and respect the role of others."" American is coach, protester in Egypt . Hassan's landmark appearance came on February 27 in a friendly against Kenya in Qatar. The Egypt team has not been able to play at home since the riots, which killed 74 people after a game between top-tier clubs Al-Masry and Al-Ahly. More lives were lost as fighting spread across the country. Hassan, who has returned to the national squad for Thursday's friendly against Nigeria in Dubai, was deeply moved by the tragedy. An outspoken figure against football hooliganism, Hassan took to the streets the following day in protest against the clashes. ""It's depressing to see the sport that everybody loves become a source of such sadness but, ultimately, what happened was a result of fanaticism,"" he said. ""I have to say that the media also played a large role by stirring up the fans' aggression instead of attempting to calm things down."" Hassan captained Egypt to Africa Cup of Nations titles in 2006, 2008 and 2010 -- his fourth overall. But the Pharaohs' form has plummeted in recent years, failing to qualify for the 2012 edition of the tournament. Hassan said the Arab uprising last year, which saw Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak overthrown in a wave of protest, was a factor in the team's fall in fortunes. ""We're all part of this country and anything that goes on affects us, so naturally our concentration levels drop and we cannot remain focused when such turmoil is happening at home. On top of that there's the fact that we couldn't play for a very long time with the league being suspended for almost four months,"" he said. Hassan said Egypt had taken for granted its ability to qualify. ""After being on top for all those years, we simply underestimated our opponents, but we have learned our lesson well and we have learned it the hard way."" Hassan carved a successful football career in Europe for 10 years, before returning in 2008 to play for Al-Ahly and, now, that club's fiercest rival Zamalek. Both teams, like Al-Masry, are supported by militant fan groups known as ""ultras."" ""It is a great thing if they stick to supporting their teams within the reasonable and ethical limits, but once it crosses the line and turns aggressive or becomes a vehicle for something completely beyond football then it becomes unacceptable and can lead to disasters,"" Hassan said. ""All over the world, ultras support their clubs using organized cheering which can be very entertaining, and this is what we as players like to see in the stands, but if they cause violence in the stadiums then no, we cannot tolerate that.""","Most-capped player in history,  Ahmed Hassan, says Egypt is suffering from a lack of ethics .

"Colombo, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- A day after a simmering dispute over the location of a new mosque in Sri Lanka's capital escalated into an attack by a Buddhist mob, the government says the issue has been resolved. The incident happened Saturday night in Grandpass, a northern sector of Colombo, which is home to a large Muslim population. Police officials say at least five people were injured in the violence, including two police officers. Police commandos and riot squads were moved into the area, and police reimposed a curfew for a second night Sunday. Colombo's Muslim mayor called it a ""dastardly attack,"" and told CNN that this was the latest in a string of such incidents. ""We appeal to the government to ensure such attacks do not recur since the right to worship is enshrined in our Constitution,"" said A.J. Mohamed Muzzamil. ""The government should bring the perpetrators of this attack"" to justice immediately, he added. The U.S. Embassy in Colombo also expressed its concern. ""This incident is particularly troubling in the light of a number of recent attacks against the Muslim community in Sri Lanka,"" the embassy said in a statement. ""Targeting any place of worship should never be permitted and we urge calm from all sides. We call for prosecution of perpetrators in this attack and an end to religious based violence. The right of all Sri Lankans to practice the religion of their choice should be protected."" The rumblings of trouble began about a year ago, when the mosque opened. It was built to replace an older place of worship about half a mile (800 meters) away, which had been earmarked for demolition in line with city development work. The new mosque was just a thousand feet away (300 meters) from a Buddhist temple, and many Buddhist worshipers had objected to the proximity. Their grievance came to a head Saturday night, just a day after Muslims celebrated the end of Ramadan. Dozens of local Buddhists took to the streets to vent their anger. But after holding talks with Muslim leaders and the clergy on both sides, the government announced Sunday that the dispute had been sorted out. Technology Minister Champika Ranawaka, who is also the general secretary of a Buddhist nationalist group, told reporters that the new building would cease to function as a mosque. Instead, the mosque will move back to its original position, and the demolition order will be rescinded. Extensive restoration will be carried out on the building. However, the area remains under tight security. Muslims make up about 7% of Sri Lanka's population of 20 million, the majority of whom are Buddhists.

"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 10:10 EST, 20 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:29 EST, 20 December 2012 . A wife-from-hell was slapped with a long ASBO after she kept her neighbours awake for three years because she was constantly nagging her husband. Julie Griffiths, 43, breached a noise abatement order a staggering 47 times in three months this year and was warned she could face jail if she does not calm down, a court heard. It came after residents living near her £75,000 mid-terraced home in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, were put through hell as she constantly 'screamed' at her 'sweet-natured' husband Norman, 63. ASBO: Noisy Julie Griffiths outside her home where she shouted at her husband so much it kept the neighbours up for three years . Mrs Griffiths was first served the notice in 1999 but she was fined £500 when she breached it again in 2010. Stoke-on-Trent Magistrates Court heard her behaviour persisted over the next two years and environmental health officers installed monitoring equipment in a neighbour's home this July. Yesterday Griffiths pleaded guilty to failing to comply with the requirements of a noise abatement notice. Staffordshire Magistrates Court imposed a five-year ASBO which prohibits her from engaging in behaviour which causes or is likely to cause a nuisance, disturbance, harassment or alarm to her neighbours. She was warned she could go to jail for five years if she breaches the antisocial order, fined £500 and told to pay £250 costs and a £15 victim surcharge. Lisa Hall, prosecuting for the Borough Council, said it was 'by far the worst' noise case an environmental health officer had ever had to deal with. She added that the noise abatement notice was breached 47 times between July 4 and October 22 this year. Steve Lee, defending, said Griffiths, a factory worker, became over-tired after working 12-hour shifts on four consecutive days and sometimes had to 'let off steam' to her husband of 23 years. Hellish: Residents of this street in Stoke have spoken of just how noisy Mrs Griffiths is and how patient her husband Norman must be . He added: 'She accepts her voice got so loud it would have disturbed the neighbours. 'She doesn't mean to do it. She comes across as an emotional woman and vents frustration by shouting and screaming. 'She does not go round committing violence, it is simply shouting within the confines of her own home. 'She realises now that she has to keep it down.' The five-year ASBO means Griffiths must not: create noise audible to neighbouring properties, shout, scream or bang on internal doors, or contact or communicate with her neighbours. After the case Councillor Tony Kearon, said: 'This is a great result for the council and, in particular, for Mrs Griffiths' neighbours who have suffered this woman's appalling behaviour at first hand over a very long period. 'Our message is clear - we are here to support our communities. 'If you are experiencing problems, come to us for help. We will not tolerate anti-social behaviour.' A council spokesman added: 'Many of the incidents concerned Griffiths screaming at her husband on a regular basis.' Neighbours yesterday said living next door to Griffiths had 'been hell.' One, who did not want to be named, said: 'Everyone in the street is sick to the back teeth of her. 'Everyone just feels so sorry for her husband Norman who is the sweetest man you could ever meet. 'He must have the patience of a saint.'","Julie Griffiths breached a noise abatement order 47 times in three months this year just by 'screaming' at her partner Norman .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- On the same day yet another death was reported in China's bird flu outbreak, the World Health Organization warned the H7N9 virus was one of the most lethal that doctors and medical investigators had faced in recent years. ""This is an unusually dangerous virus for humans,"" Keiji Fukuda, WHO's assistant director-general for health, security and the environment told a news conference in Beijing Wednesday. ""We think this virus is more easily transmitted from poultry to humans than H5N1,"" he added, referring to the bird flu outbreak between 2004 and 2007 that claimed 332 lives. ""This is definitely one of the most lethal influenza viruses that we have seen so far."" As investigations continue into the possible sources of infection, Fukuda warned that authorities were still struggling to understand the virus. The WHO said China must brace for continued infections. Fukuda's warning came as Taiwanese health authorities said they've confirmed the first human case of H7N9 in Taiwan -- one they said was imported from China. A 53-year-old Taiwanese man who worked in eastern China was confirmed to have H7N9 on Wednesday, the Taiwanese Centers for Disease Control said. His condition was described to be severe. He had been traveling back and forth regularly between China's Jingsu province and Taiwan, health officials said. ""According to the case, he had not been exposed to birds and poultry during his stay in Suzhou (in Jingsu province) and had not consumed undercooked poultry or eggs,"" the Taiwanese CDC said. Taiwanese health officials said they are screening travelers arriving from China for signs of H7N9. Fukuda, meanwhile, said WHO officials ""are at the beginning of our understanding of this virus."" ""(The situation remains) complex, difficult and it is evolving,"" he said. So far there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, the authorities say. ""We do want to note, however, that if limited person-to-person transmission is demonstrated in the future, this really will not be surprising,"" Fukuda warned, adding that it was critical to remain vigilant, monitoring the virus's spread and mutation. ""We are not sure that the clusters were caused by common exposure to a source of the virus or were due to limited person-to-person transmission,"" he said. ""Moreover we have not seen sustained person-to-person transmission."" While some elements of the outbreak have baffled investigators -- specifically why the virus tends to target an elderly demographic and the fact that it is asymptomatic or mild in some cases and lethal in others -- authorities have claimed some significant victories in the fight against a pandemic. Anne Kelso, the director of a WHO-collaborating research center, said researchers had seen a ""dramatic slowdown"" in human cases in Shanghai after the city's live poultry market was shut on April 6. Describing the finding as ""very encouraging,"" she said evidence suggests the closure of live poultry markets is an effective way to stop the spread of the virus. The joint inspection team from China's National Health and Family Planning Commission and the World Health Organization also found that, so far, no migratory birds have tested positive for the virus, taking another worrying route of transmission out of the equation. It said the H7N9 virus is only being found in chickens, ducks and pigeons at live poultry markets. WHO officials said there are already efforts underway in other countries to develop a vaccine after Chinese officials admitted international help would be needed with this. Meanwhile, the National Health and Family Planning Commission said in its daily update on H7N9 cases that a total of 109 H7N9 cases have been reported within mainland China, including 23 deaths. Most cases have been confined to Shanghai and neighboring provinces in eastern China. CNN's Ivan Watson and Feng Ke in Beijing contributed to this report.","NEW: First H7N9 bird flu case in Taiwan has been reported, health officials say .

"JENA, Louisiana (CNN) -- Mychal Bell, the sole defendant who remains behind bars from the group of teens known as the ""Jena 6,"" will not be released Friday, a court decided. Mychal Bell, 17, is accused with five others of beating Justin Barker in a school fight. Bell, 17, has been in jail since his arrest more than nine months ago. It was not immediately clear what happened in court Friday, where Bell's attorneys had planned to push for his release. ""It is our understanding that the judge refused to give bond or bail to Mychal Bell today,"" the Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist who traveled to Jena for Thursday's rally, said in a written statement. A source inside the court said the issue of bond was not discussed at the hearing. Attorneys did not immediately comment. The proceedings, involving a juvenile, are not open to media. Bell's mother left the courthouse in tears. ""We'll be back,"" shouted one Jena 6 supporter outside the courthouse Friday. With thousands of demonstrators converging on the small town Thursday to decry what they call ""unequal justice,"" the state's 3rd Circuit Court of Appeal ordered a bond hearing for Bell within 72 hours. It was set for Friday morning.  See highlights from the march » . Also on Friday, the FBI said it was looking into an online posting by a neo-Nazi white supremacist group that published the home addresses of all six of the African-American teenagers, as well as the phone numbers of some. The group said on its Web site it is calling on followers to ""let them know justice is coming."" Bell is the only one of the six teenagers to stand trial so far. District Attorney Reed Walters tried him as an adult and won convictions on two charges. Walters has said he believes Bell was the instigator of the alleged beating of classmate Justin Barker. Last week, the appellate court vacated Bell's battery conviction, saying he should never have been tried as an adult. He was 16 at the time; 17 is the legal adult age in Louisiana. A district judge earlier this month tossed out Bell's conviction for conspiracy to commit second-degree battery. On Tuesday, a three-judge panel said it was ""premature"" to consider releasing Bell. The district attorney will determine whether to refile the charges in juvenile court, a defense attorney said. Bails for the Jena 6 had been set at between $70,000 and $138,000, and all but Bell posted bond. The judge has refused to lower his $90,000 bail, citing the teen's record, which includes four juvenile offenses -- two simple battery charges among them. Bell and five other defendants were arrested in the alleged beating of Barker, who is white, at their high school on December 4. The incident followed months of racial tension, sparked originally when three white teens hung nooses from an oak tree the day after a group of black students violated an unofficial rule among students that only whites sit in that area.  See timeline of how events unfolded » . Prosecutors originally charged all six black students with second-degree attempted murder and conspiracy. Walters reduced charges against at least four of them -- Bell, Robert Bailey Jr., Carwin Jones and Theo Shaw -- to battery and conspiracy. Bryant Purvis awaits arraignment. Charges against Jesse Ray Beard, 14 at the time of the alleged crime, are unavailable because he's a juvenile. Civil rights leaders and other demonstrators call events in Jena a sign of unequal justice in the 21st century. The white kids who hung the nooses were briefly suspended from classes but faced no punishments from the legal system. Donald Washington, U.S. attorney for the Western District of Louisiana, told CNN that the FBI and other investigators thought the noose incident bore the markings of a hate crime, but a decision was made not to press charges because the case didn't meet federal criteria. The students were under 18 and had no prior records, and no group such as the Ku Klux Klan was found to be behind their actions. Authorities estimated about 15,000 to 20,000 protesters came out Thursday to Jena -- a town of about 3,000, according to the 2000 census.

"By . Steve Hopkins . Two vulnerable single mothers were exploited by a cruel conman who pretended that he was terminally ill and had served in Afghanistan as a marine. David Andrews has been jailed for 20 months for taking advantage of Heather Neal and Melanie Poynter before stealing from their children and selling their possessions on. Norwich Crown Court heard how the fraudster won the sympathy of the two women by spinning a series of yarns about his past at a time when they were particularly defenceless. Victims: Melanie Poynter, left, and Heather Neal, right, were exploited by conman and thief David Andrews . Andrews, 32, became . involved with Miss Neal, 37, of Spixworth, Norfolk, in . June 2012, telling her that he was suffering from cancer. He . persuaded her to take him for treatment at the Norfolk and Norwich . University Hospital - even though there was nothing wrong with him. While she waited in her car for him outside the hospital he would simply wander around the corridors to waste time and make her think he was seeing a doctor, the court heard. He later stole an iPad belonging to her daughter and sold it. Fraud: David Andrews told 'lie after lie' to 'weedle his way' into the single mother's lives . Andrews then targeted Miss Poynter, 33, of Cromer, Norfolk, and started a relationship with her. He . told her that he was a former Royal Marine who had shot children in . Afghanistan and was therefore suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Andrews stole and sold an iPod, DS Lite and Xbox Connect belonging to Miss Poynter's daughter, while she was in hospital receiving treatment for a serious kidney condition. The iPad contained the only pictures and video Miss Poynter had of her daughter taking part in the Olympic Torch relay in 2012. Andrews, from Walcott in Norfolk, admitted two counts of theft and fraud by false representation. Judge . Stephen Holt said Andrews had told 'lie after lie' and had managed to . 'wheedle his way' into the lives of the women who were struggling to . bring up their children. He . said: 'The lies you told were quite incredible. The bigger the lie, the . more likely people are to believe it. In my view what you did was . utterly despicable. 'This is one of the worst types of case, on its facts, of this particular offence that I've come across.' Prosecutor Chris Youell said: 'Essentially he was living a lie, creating a back story to ingratiate himself to these women.' Both victims read out victim statements in court, despite being reduced to tears by the crime. Miss . Neal said Andrews' lies were 'constant' and told how her daughter was . 'really upset' by the theft - thinking at first that a stranger had burgled their . house. She added that she now finds it 'very hard' to trust men. Devastated: Miss Poynter and Miss Neal said that Andrews' crime had damaged their ability to trust others . Deceit: Andrews claimed to have been a Royal Marine, like the men seen here on a training exercise . Richard Wood, who defended Andrews, admitted that the offences were of a 'very unpleasant character' and 'wholly unacceptable'. He said Andrews might need 'professional help'. After the hearing, Miss Poynter described Andrews as 'evil'. Sergeant . Kevin White of Norfolk Police said Andrews followed the same pattern in . manipulating both women and may have done it to others. He urged anyone else affected by Andrews to contact police.","Heather Neal and Melanie Poynter were both exploited by David Andrews .

"(CNN) -- An Iranian human-rights activist and Nobel laureate has joined the legal team of an Iranian-American journalist convicted of spying and jailed in Iran. Shirin Ebadi, a civil rights leader in Iran, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003. Shirin Ebadi, who won a Nobel Peace Prize in 2003, took up the case of Roxana Saberi at the request of Saberi's family, her father, Reza Saberi, told CNN Wednesday. Ebadi heads the Center for Defenders of Human Rights in Iran. Saberi, 31, was sentenced Saturday to eight years in prison after a one-day trial that was closed to the public.  President Obama, as well as other U.S. and international officials sharply denounced the decision. The Rev. Jesse Jackson has offered to travel to Iran to help seek Saberi's release. ""If our voices are heard in Iran today, I would be anxious to travel with a delegation to Iran, if we are permitted, and make an appeal for her freedom,"" said the longtime civil rights activist, according to his Rainbow PUSH Coalition. Jackson, 67, spoke Tuesday at a peace conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. ""Whenever we've brought people out of captivity, whether in Syria, Cuba, Iraq or Yugoslavia, or Liberia, it's always opened a diplomatic door to reduce tensions,"" he said. Saberi's attorneys said they will appeal her conviction. Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Hashemi Shahroudi ordered the head of Tehran's Justice Department to make sure the appeals process is quick and fair. Jackson has offered in the past to help release American hostages, most recently in 2005. At that time, he said he was willing to use his role as a religious leader to help secure the release of Roy Hallums, who was kidnapped along with five others in Baghdad in November 2004. Hallums was freed in September 2005 when U.S.  troops raided the farmhouse where he being held outside Baghdad. In 1984, Jackson secured the release of a Navy pilot held in Syria. In 1991, he helped secure the release of 500 ""international guests"" held in Iraq. And in 1999, he persuaded Yugoslavia to release three U.S. soldiers held there during the Kosovo conflict. Obama has called for Saberi's release, saying he is ""gravely concerned with her safety and well-being.""  Watch how U.S.-Iranian relations are complicated » . ""We are working to make sure that she is properly treated, and to get more information about the disposition of her case,"" Obama said Sunday. ""She is an American citizen, and I have complete confidence that she was not engaging in any sort of espionage."" Iranian officials initially said Saberi was held for buying a bottle of wine. The Foreign Ministry later said she was detained for reporting without proper credentials. Saberi, who comes from North Dakota, has been living in Iran since 2003, said the Committee to Protect Journalists, a journalists' advocacy group. She has freelanced for National Public Radio and other news organizations, and was writing a book about Iranian culture. Iranian authorities revoked her press credentials in 2006, but Saberi continued to file short news items without permission, the journalists' group said. Saberi was detained in January, although no formal charges were disclosed. On April 9, word emerged that Saberi had been charged with espionage. ""Without press credentials and under the name of being a reporter, she was carrying out espionage activities,"" Hassan Haddad, a deputy public prosecutor, told the Iranian Students News Agency. Authorities also said Saberi had confessed. Her father said he thinks she was coerced into making damaging statements. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.","2003 Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi offers to help in Iran .

The horrific accident forced the full closure of the westbound carriageway at junction 26 in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire where the Mercedes truck collided with the white Audi A5. The occupants of the Audi, a 46-year-old man and a 43-year-old woman, both believed to be from Bishop Auckland, Durham, died at the scene after the truck overturned onto the back half of their car. Deadly drive: Both occupants of the white Audi died at the scene after they collided with a truck on the M62 westbound at 5.50am today . Overturned truck: While police are investigating the circumstances that led to the Audi being crushed under the truck, the truck driver was sent to hospital for minor injuries . The road closure, which has now been in place for more than 10 hours, is causing massive traffic delays with gridlock reported in Birkenshaw, Liversedge, Heckmondwike, Mirfield and Ravensthorpe as a result. A police spokesman said that the road closures are expected to continue until later today while they investigate the cause of the crash. While police do not know exactly how the crash happened, long skid marks and scattered debris at the scene of the accident suggest that speed played a factor in the fatal collision. The truck driver, a 43-year-old man from North East Lincolnshire, Yorkshire was taken to hospital for minor injuries. The Major Collision Enquiry Team (MCET) is appealing for witnesses to assist with their investigations. Sgt . Garry Alderson of MCET said: ‘Clearly this was a very serious incident . which has sadly resulted in the deaths of the man and woman travelling . in the Audi. ‘We are . conducting a full collision investigation at the scene and obviously . this will take time given the seriousness of the incident. ‘I . would advise drivers to avoid the area if at all possible while . recovery work is underway and would ask anyone who saw the incident or . either of the vehicles described shortly beforehand to contact the Major .

"Researchers . have taken a step closer to creating ‘cyborg insects’ that could carry out . spying missions - with biofuel cells that run off their own bodies. A . team has created the implantable power packs that use the insects’ own body . chemistry to fuel robot attachments fixed on to them. The . breakthrough brings us one step closer to the the day when bugs can be fitted . with recording devices, sensors or other electronics and used as tiny spies - an area which the U.S. military's 'mad scientist' division, DARPA, has already researched extensively. Until now researchers had relied on solar power or conventional batteries but they were not powerful enough or did not last long enough to do the tasks required. The ¿cyber bugs¿ could potentially keep going for days on end - or even for as long as they are alive . The U.S military's Darpa research wing is already researching how to 'control' insects using hi-tech attachments. 'Bees have been used to locate mines and weapons of . mass destruction. The Hybrid Insect Micro Electromechanical Systems program is aimed at developing technology to provide control . over insect locomotion, just as reins are needed for effective control . over horse locomotion,' says Darpa'ssite. The new technique, where the insect could 'power' electronic attachments using its own body chemistry, could be crucial. Until . now researchers had relied on solar power or conventional batteries but they . were not powerful enough or did not last long enough to do that tasks required. The ‘cyber bugs’ could potentially keep going for days on end - or even for as long . as they are alive. The . research from Case Western Reserve University in the U.S. involved putting two . enzymes into cockroaches to break down the complex molecules they make after . eating. The . first turns the molecules into sugar, and the second oxidises it - in the . process releasing electrons. These . electrons are then run into the battery and produce a current. One . of the advantages of the technique is that the insect does not have to be in . motion for the current to flow, meaning a bug can be put in an enclosed space . and the battery will still work. After . the tests the Case Western team put electrodes into the insects and found there . was no long-term damage, which means they could be re-used for a number of . missions. Daniel . Scherson, chemistry professor at Case Western and senior author of the paper, . said that the possible uses were endless. He . said: ‘An insect equipped with a sensor could measure the amount of noxious gas . in a room, broadcast the finding, shut down and recharge for an hour, then take . a new measurement and broadcast again.’ The . research team are now trying to make the battery as small as possible so the . insect can fly or move around without the power pack restricting it. They . have calculated that the maximum output from the battery is currently 100 . microwatts per square centimeter, at 0.2 volts. A . typical AA battery, the kind used to power many electronic devices, provides . 1.5 volts. In . a separate study, a team from the University of Michigan are developing . techniques to harness the movement and body heat of cockroaches which could . provide an alternative way of powering gadgets attached to them.","Beetles power battery with their body chemistry .

"By . Jennifer Smith . Caroline Criado-Perez was the victim of an online 'avalanche' of abuse after supporting a campaign calling for women to appear on banknotes. Two people will face charges in relation to comments made on Twitter . A man and a woman are to appear in court after sending threatening messages on Twitter to a woman campaigning for females to appear on banknotes. Isabella Sorley and John Nimmo will be charged with improper use of a communications network for their roles in the 'avalanche' of abuse directed towards Carolina Criado-Perez, the Crown Prosecution Service has revealed. The journalist received a torrent . of death threats and sexist remarks alongside other female campaigners after calling for women to . be featured on banknotes. Baljit Ubhey, chief crown prosecutor for CPS London, said: 'Following early consultation with the police, the CPS has been asked to make a charging decision in respect of five suspects whom it is alleged sent offensive tweets to Stella Creasy MP and journalist and campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez. 'We reviewed these cases in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors and guidelines issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions on prosecuting cases involving communications sent via social media. Sorley, 23, and Nimmo, 25, will face charges in Westminster's Magistrates Court on January 7. Detectives ruled there was insufficient evidence to prosecute one suspect, while another who is accused of sending offensive messages to Stella Creasy MP will avoid sentencing as prosecution 'would not be in the public interest'. 'In relation to the fifth suspect, we have asked the police to carry out further investigation before a charging decision can be made,' Mr Ubjey added. 'We have written to both Ms Creasy and Ms Criado-Perez to inform them of these decisions.' Ms Criado-Perez responded to the news online, writing on Twitter: 'Well that’s pretty awesome. CPS informing press about charges ahead of me. 'About the level of victim-support I’ve grown to expect.' Ms Creasy, MP for Walthamstow, was also . targeted when she came to the defence of Ms Criado-Perez, who allegedly . received an 'avalanche' of abuse after leading a campaign for women to . be featured on bank notes.

Over 60,000 people signed an online petition calling for Twitter to take action against the abuse, prompting the website to launch a 'report abuse' button on its latest iPhone app. Speaking in July, the company's general manager for the UK said: 'We will suspend accounts that, once reported to us, are found to be in breach of the rules. 'Also we are testing ways to simplify reporting, e.g. within a Tweet by using the 'Report Tweet' button in our iPhone app and on mobile web.

"(CNN) -- You don't have to be an expert to ask yourself the question: How in the world, with today's technology, can a commercial airplane go missing? It's a question, but also an expression of disbelief. Those who get lost driving can use GPS. If you lose your iPhone, there's an app to track it down. Scientists successfully plotted the course for a spacecraft that landed on a speeding comet. But something goes wrong aboard a 123-foot, 67-ton passenger jet, and rescuers must resort to scouring the ocean? ""Why is it easier to find an iPhone (than) to find a plane?"" one Twitter user, Catalina Buitano, asked. There are dozens of similar questions on social media. They hint at the same sentiment: In a world where people's locations are tracked for everything from map apps to what ads appear on a Web browser, why does Big Brother's gaze avoid the skies? ""Why, in this day and age, do we rely on the physical recovery of black boxes? Flight data should be continuously streamed to the cloud,"" read a tweet by Jacob Rossi. Of course, this question has been asked before. The disappearance of AirAsia Flight 8501 on Sunday was the second time this year that a plane vanished. Debris from the Airbus A320-200 has been found, the airline said Tuesday, and two bodies have been found. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished, too, and remains missing 10 months later. At that time, Jim Hall, the former head of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, called for upgrades to the tracking capabilities of planes that fly for extended periods over water. The airline industry has invested billions of dollars in safety features, ""yet many allow their aircraft to fall off any direct tracking capability as they fly over vast ocean distances and remote locations, confident that these planes will occasionally check in and reappear as they near the other side of the blacked-out area,"" Hall wrote. In a preliminary report on MH370, Malaysian aviation authorities recommended that the International Civil Aviation Organization look into the benefits of introducing a standard for real-time tracking of commercial aircraft. The technology exists to track flight data in real time, but even after tragedies such as MH370, cost and government bureaucracy are cited as obstacles to implementation. ""Millions of us can be located immediately through technology in our handheld cell phones, but a 300,000-pound Boeing 777 with 239 souls on board disappears from the face of the Earth,"" Hall wrote, referring to MH370. ""NASA has the capability of photographing stars billions of light-years away, and yet our best minds are forced to guess where this plane might be."" Another Twitter user phrased the thought this way: ""If we have astronauts reaching safely the International Space Station, why do we still have missing planes on Earth?"" CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo says it is time for world leaders to take concrete action on upgrading technology for tracking planes. Making recommendations isn't enough, she said. There need to be laws. ""I think at this day and age, there's really no excuse for (not having real-time tracking),"" Schiavo said on CNN's ""New Day"" on Monday. ""I mean, the kind of technology, it's already here. We don't have to wait to develop it. Those planes could be sending out continuous signals."" Two companies with products on the market for real-time streaming are Flyht and Star Navigation Systems. But the technology is not catching on with major carriers. Cost has been the biggest hurdle, though the technology is slowly finding its way onto airplanes, said Seth Kaplan, managing partner at Airline Weekly. Airlines have lobbied for governments to contribute money to equipping planes with new technology, arguing that it is not just an airline issue, but a national security consideration. The question of who will pay for the technology is beginning to get answered, but not as quickly as travelers would like to see, Kaplan said. So, those in disbelief are not alone in wondering how in today's world a plane could simply get lost. It's just not an easy question to answer.","NEW: Debris from AirAsia flight has been recovered, officials say; two bodies found .

"Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg faced the media after Belgium Grand Prix crash . Lewis Hamilton said trust is not something he applies to motor racing after being asked about his relationship with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg going forward following the controversial incident involving the two at the Belgian Grand Prix. Hamilton's race at Spa was wrecked after the front right-wing of Rosberg's car hit his left-rear tyre, resulting in the Briton suffering a puncture. Hamilton, who later claimed the German's actions were intentional, was eventually forced to retire late on in the race, while Rosberg went on to finish second and subsequently move 29 points clear of his rival in the fight for the title. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lewis Hamilton preview this weekend's Italian Grand Prix . Facing the media: Lewis Hamilton answered questions from the assembled press ahead of the Italian GP . When asked if there was a base of trust and understanding for the two team-mates to be able to work together from here, Hamilton said on Thursday: 'Trust is a big word and that's not really something that I would particularly apply to racing on the track. 'Nico and me, we've been racing for a long time and I think we set a good foundation a long long time ago so that's what we work from.' Hamilton also seemed keen not to dwell on the incident, saying he was looking forward to this weekend's race at Monza. Making his point: Hamilton was in an animated mood during the press conference on Thursday . He added at a press conference: 'It's not in my mind. I'm really excited about moving forwards, really energetic, had a good couple of days break last week and excited to be here, this is one of my favourite circuits. 'I hope that we can have a good weekend.' On his own future, Hamilton added: 'We are constantly talking with the team. I still have a contract for a whole year on top of this one. I see my future with Mercedes. I am really happy there.' Rosberg, meanwhile, admitted he was not proud of the incident at Spa. 'In Spa definitely I was not proud of the way it went because in general I really want to contribute to my sport, because I want it to be the most entertaining sport in the world,' he said. 'And if I am able contribute to that in many ways throughout the season then I'm very happy, and I'm sure in many ways we have.' Meat in the sandwich: Alonso sat between the two rivals for the Formula One title . Mercedes took 'suitable disciplinary measures' against Rosberg following the Belgian Grand Prix, hitting the German with a six-figure fine. Hamilton confirmed on Thursday that there were no threats of punishment from the Brackley-based marque hanging over either him and Rosberg going forward - or orders not to challenge each other on the track. He told Sky Sports: 'There's none of that, we're free to race and I think that it's just very clear that they don't want what happened in the last race to happen. 'So it's just another normal weekend for me and we're just going to be pushing ourselves to move forwards.' Rosberg, who has apologised for the incident at Spa, was jeered on the podium at the end of the race but hopes to avoid a repeat from British racing fans if he finishes in the top three in Italy this weekend. He told Sky Sports: 'I hope they accept my apology with time. I fully understand they were not happy in Spa because they came a long way to see a great race and it didn't happen, so I hope that with time they can enjoy the battle we're having.'

"Ten senior members of North Korea’s ruling party have been executed after they were caught watching soap operas. The officials were killed on the order of dictator Kim Jong-Un, taking the number of senior government and military members executed this year to 50, South Korea's intelligence agency have said. The ten were ‘executed by firing squad for watching South Korean soap operas, bribery or womanising’. Scroll down for video . Smiling dictator: North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un attends a women's football match in Pyongyang . Pirate copies of South Korean and Chinese television programmes are widely available and traded on the black market, The Telegraph reports. Details on the executions were provided by the intelligence service in a report to the South Korean parliament on Tuesday, Yonhap News told the paper. Kim Jong-Un’s father, Kim Jong-Il and grandfather Kim Il-Sung, fiercely protected the population of North Korea from any foreign or modern influences. However, Jon-Un has struggled to shield the North Koreans as mobile phones and the internet has blurred borders. Cheered on: The women's football game saw the North Korean team meet a team from national team and the Wolmido, an island just south of the border to South Korea . Inspection: Jong-Un, pictured with his wife Ri Sol Ju, right, visit a newly-built restaurant for service personnel in Pyongyang this week . Tough leader: According to South Korean intelligence, Kim Jong-Un has had 50 senior Worker's Party and military officials executed in 2014 alone . No time for fun for you, only me: Ten officials have been executed for watching South Korean soap operas . Last week, South Korean media reported that six officials - including the minister of mail and telecommunications, the commanding officer of North Korea's air force and a key official in the North's sport programmes - have not been present at a series of important events in recent months. An intelligence source told South Korea's renowned JoongAng Ilbo newspaper that 'six minister-level officials were executed'. If true, it would be the third major purge since the dictator Kim Jong-un assumed power in 2011.

"(CNN) -- The University of Virginia has suspended all fraternity activities until January 2015 while authorities investigate allegations of sexual assault made against members of a prominent fraternity house there. As the father of two young girls who will someday be college women, my heart goes out to any student harmed by sexual assault. There is no place on any campus or anywhere for such behavior, and students need protection from criminals. And as president and chief executive of the North-American Interfraternity Conference, I am eager to work with administrators at Virginia and other campuses to take on this challenge. From both perspectives, I urge college administrators to act responsibly. We cannot solve this terrible problem by punishing all fraternities and fraternity members for the deplorable actions of a few. By all means, schools should investigate every allegation and hold students accountable for their actions. They should seek criminal charges against those who break the law and suspend or expel those who violate university policy. But they should not violate the rights of those who live by the rules simply because they are in some way affiliated with those who do not. The vast majority of fraternity and sorority members join them for all the right reasons. They are looking for a place to belong. They want to learn and apply leadership skills. They seek an outlet where they can give back to their communities. They want to enrich their collegiate experience. To take all of this away from so many good kids simply because a few kids choose to be bad is unfair, misguided and short-sighted. When fraternity is done right, I firmly believe it is one of the best facets of college life. My own fraternity experience enabled me to grow into a man, excel in school and better understand the value of community. I became a better person when I joined, and in my current role, I aspire to help other young men become better people. The North-American Interfraternity Conference stands ready to participate in a productive discussion. This is why I formed three commissions this year to study the most vexing problems facing colleges today: sexual assault, alcohol abuse and hazing. Over the next 18 months, these panels will come up with meaningful recommendations to address each problem. I will share these recommendations with university administrators and NIC members alike, with the explicit goal of overcoming these issues in the years ahead. The developments at Virginia and other campuses are alarming. I hope we can galvanize now to find solutions soon. At the same time, I am committed to protecting the fraternity movement, so that all students who choose to join a fraternity can join one -- and experience membership in the way it was intended.","Peter Smithhisler: University of Virginia suspended fraternities till January after rape allegations .

"(CNN) -- What's Spanish for ""twerk?"" Mexican officials are in no hurry to find out. This is one U.S. import our southern neighbor wants nothing to do with. Ditto for Miley Cyrus, the controversial singer known less for her music than for her over-sexualized on-stage spectacles intended to get attention and shock the senses. Cyrus accomplished both on the Diez y Seis de Septiembre -- better known, on this side of the border, as September 16th. North of the Rio Grande, that day is like any other, as insignificant as the Fourth of July is in Canada. However, in Mexico, the day is awfully important. It's Independence Day. And since Mexicans are a proud people who put a high value on respect, it's probably not a good idea for Americans -- or anyone else for that matter -- to go to Mexico on Mexican Independence Day and show disrespect to, oh, the Mexican flag. That's what Cyrus and fellow performers did last week during a concert in the northern city of Monterrey in a stunt that gives new meaning to the phrase ""ugly Americans."" As Cyrus ""twerked"" onstage, while wearing -- yes, you read this right -- a giant prosthetic butt, her backup singers whipped her with rolled up pieces of cloth that turned out to be miniature Mexican flags. It was a trifecta of bad judgment -- the wrong thing to do, the wrong country to do it in, and all of it happening on the wrong day. Before you could say international incident, outraged Mexican state legislators asked the federal government to fine the pop star for desecrating the Mexican flag. Under a law that prohibits abuse of ""national emblems, the flag and the national anthem,"" such a transgression can normally earn someone a $1,270 fine as well as, in some cases, a couple of days in jail. The legislators are asking that Cyrus get locked up for 36 hours. Mexican authorities are investigating. There are those in this country who will claim that the singer is being singled out because she is an American. But actually, in this case, equal treatment would call out for some sort of punishment. It's a good time to send a message. In 2008, Mexican pop star Paulina Rubio was fined $4,000 for appearing in a Spanish magazine, clutching a Mexican flag wrapped around her naked body. What the 21-year-old Cyrus and her crew did was tasteless and thoughtless. And whether or not Mexican officials decide to formally charge her with desecrating the Mexican flag, she ought to apologize -- in person, and on Mexican soil. Having said that, Mexican officials need to be careful not to overplay their hand and protest too much, lest they turn legitimate concerns about professional decorum in the entertainment industry into dinner theater. The initial response was not encouraging. Speaking to CNN, Mexican State Rep. Francisco TreviÃ±o said this: ""I am truly offended and annoyed by the fact that a foreign artist feels like she can come here and make fun of and mock our national flag on Independence Day, September 16th."" Seriously? Trevino can't really believe that the stunt was intended as a direct assault on the Mexican flag. An assault on decency and good manners, maybe. Does he think this was some sort of political statement? He is probably giving Cyrus and her backup dancers too much credit. Finally, is this really an attempt to mock the flag? The dancers used it as a prop, but the idea was clearly to draw attention to Cyrus -- not the flag. As a Mexican-American, I realize that, in Mexico, my grandfather's homeland, the second-most popular sport -- after soccer -- is American bashing. And Cyrus played right into the hands of our neighbors by giving them a weapon to wield against us. But Mexicans don't always have to play that game. Let's hope that they treat this for what it is -- an isolated incident by an immature and attention starved pop singer. Nothing more. The U.S.-Mexico relationship is strong. It has suffered through war, conquest, revolution, migration, xenophobia, gun running, drugs, protectionism, Manifest Destiny, income disparity and more. It can suffer fools.","Ruben Navarrette: Miley Cyrus concert in Monterrey, Mexico made tasteless use of Mexican flag .

A Government tax adviser has resigned after he was secretly filmed offering tips on how to keep money 'out of the Chancellor's grubby mitts', according to reports. David Heaton spoke at a London conference entitled, '101 ideas for personal tax planning', two months before becoming a member of a panel advising HM Revenue and Customs on tackling tax avoidance. He stepped down after he was recorded by . BBC's Panorama programme, as part of a joint investigation with Private . Eye, outlining the advantages of tax planning, which he said included . ways to keep the money from George Osborne's 'grubby mitts'. Today, a Treasury minister said Heaton was 'directly at odds' with the Government's position. Scroll down for video . Taxing situation: Heaton resigned after telling an audience how to reduce tax paid on bonuses by over 30 per cent . The treasury said that Mr Heaton's statements are directly at odds with the Government's approach to tackling tax avoidance . Mr Osborne was reportedly told about the comments - to be broadcast by the BBC on Monday - before flying to a meeting of European finance ministers in Lithuania. A source said the Chancellor had been 'very annoyed' upon learning of Mr Heaton's comments and 'instructed tough action be taken'. Mr Heaton denied doing anything wrong, but his resignation was announced yesterday, the BBC said. He had also been filmed describing a maternity scheme he called the Bump Plan, and saying: 'Ninety per cent of what you pay out ends up with the employee. You can't really knock that one.' He explained at the conference, in June, that by deliberately timing bonuses to enable an increased rebate on maternity pay, the tax paid on the bonus would effectively fall from 41.8 per cent to just 8.4 per cent, the BBC said. David Gauke, Exchequer Secretary to the . Treasury, said: 'The General Anti-Abuse Rule (GAAR) is designed to . protect taxpayers. The role of the GAAR advisory panel is to make sure . the GAAR is used where appropriate - that is to challenge the most . artificial, contrived and aggressive behaviour.

'Mr Heaton's statements are directly at odds with the Government's approach to tackling tax avoidance. A member of the panel should not behave in a way that could undermine the GAAR and its effectiveness. Therefore, it is right that Mr Heaton resigned from his position.' An HMRC spokesman said: 'The work of the General Anti Abuse Rule advisory panel plays an important role in HMRC's highly effective drive against tax abuse. 'The panel must command the confidence of both tax practioners and the general public. We will be announcing Mr Heaton's successor shortly.' Mr Heaton told Panorama: 'I do not believe a person who advocates artificial or abusive tax arrangements should be a panel member. I did not advocate any such arrangement at the conference and do not advocate such arrangements.' Chair of the Public Accounts Committee Margaret Hodge told the BBC: 'This is an absolutely classic example of where government passes a law with a particular intent and the tax advisers then abuse that and use it for a purpose that was never intended by government.'","George Osborne said to be 'very annoyed' upon learning of the comments .

A giant panda found itself having aimed a little too high when it got stuck up a spruce tree in northwest China. The panda bear had been caught helping itself to sweetcorn by a farmer's dogs and was chased up the tree by the pack. Despite pandas being excellent climbers, this particular one became stuck amidst the branches after the crowd gathered below gave it stage fright. Stage fright: The panda became stuck after being chased up the tree by a pack of dogs in Zhouzhi county, northwest China's Shaanxi province . Long fall: The panda is barely visible among the top branches of the tree as a net is put up below it . Helping hands: Firemen and local residents got together to catch the panda should it fall out of the treetop . The farmer whose crops the panda had been helping itself to called the fire services when the locals begun to fear it might fall out of the tree. Firemen and locals in Zhouzhi county, in China's Shaanxi province, put up a net to catch the panda if it fell, and then left it alone to climb down under its own steam. A staff member from the local nature reserve in  said: 'We identified this giant panda as a 10 years old male, and the nets were not really needed. ‘The panda is good at climbing, I have never heard of one falling off a tree. All that was needed was that people do not stand around and let the panda free to leave without a crowd.’ Suit yourself: The panda had been stealing sweetcorn from a local farmers field when it was chased up the tree . Staying put: The scared panda remained safely in the treetop, refusing to climb down, let alone jump . Up he goes: One of the local farmers inspects the tree trunk bearing the markings of the panda . Sticky situation: The panda did not come down until the crowd has dispersed, but reportedly returned safely to the nearby woods . The panda later made it down on its own after the crowd had dispersed for the night, and safely made it back to the woods. Giant pandas are solitary bears when in the wild, usually preferring their own company when foraging in Chinese bamboo forests. They are an endangered species, with less than 2,000 thought to be left roaming free in the cool forests that are their natural habitat.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:27 EST, 31 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:37 EST, 31 August 2013 . Andy Murray, pictured outside 10 Downing Street after winning Wimbledon this year, could lose £500,000 due to a planning setback . He can't seem to stop winning on the court, but Andy Murray has suffered a blow off it after it emerged he is set to lose £500,000 because of botched investment plans in a new Surrey golf course. The tennis star, who won Wimbledon this summer and is currently competing in the US Open championships he triumphed at last year, invested the money for the planned course and spa at Cherkley Court in Leatherhead, Surrey. Beaverbrook Golf Club would have been the 141st course in the county, where Murray lives with his girlfriend, Kim Sears, but 10 days ago a High Court judge quashed the planning permission granted to developers Longshot Ltd, according to The Independent. The firm must now restore the course site to its original condition, unless it lodges a successful appeal. The cost, thought to be hundreds of thousands, will be added to legal costs and loss of income if the course is not built. Despite the potential loss, Murray, who reached the third round of the US Open last night, is not short of cash. Winning Wimbledon added a cool £1.6million to his near-£30million career prize money, while the allure of working with Britain's first SW19 champion since 1936 has proved too much for sponsors, which now include Rado, Adidas and the Royal Bank of Scotland. And last year it was revealed the Scot had invested in a rambling hotel in his native Dunblane. Another who could potentially lose out on the failed golf course project is advertising mogul Sir Frank Lowe, who invested £250,000, which planned to turn the home of the late press baron Lord Beaverbrook, Cherkley Court near Leatherhead, into a hotel and spa, with the golf course. Murray had wanted to turn Cherkley Court in Leatherhead, Surrey, into a golf club and spa but a judge quashed the planning permission . The country house is near where Murray lives with girlfriend Kim Sears, right, in Surrey . But another major loser will be the unique chalklands of the Leatherhead Downs, which some feel may never recover from the damage already done. Mole Valley District Council allowed the project last year against the advice of its planning officers and warnings from environmental experts. Local campaigners challenged the decision in the High Court and won. Mr Justice Haddon-Cave found the council’s decision to grant planning permission on such an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty was perverse, and that the council had 'erred in law'. The requirement to restore the site arises because Longshot decided to carry on as if its planning permission were unassailable, and cleared meadows. Environmental law specialist Richard Buxton, for the campaigners, obtained legal undertakings from Longshot to undo any damage if it lost. 'It is particularly gratifying having the court so explicitly recognising that what may be profitable for developers is not necessarily in the public interest,' he said. Murray, in winning action at the US Open last night, has had little to scowl about on the court in the last year, winning Wimbledon, last year's US Open and the Olympics . Longshot said it  was 'amazed' and 'appalled' at the ruling. The judge denied leave to appeal, but the firm is expected to try anyway. Professor David Hawksworth CBE, a former Council of English Nature member and a local resident, said there should have been no 'physical disturbance or spraying' without 'scientific assessment' of the site by skilled specialists. John Northcott, portfolio holder of planning at Mole Valley District Council, said: 'We will now need to take time to consider what our next steps will be.'",Tennis hero thwarted in bid for new course in Leatherhead after judge quashes planning permission .,3d4218b4ddae0979e3e40ba657059d96d167b1f1

The horrifying Owlman's head is made of a mixture of papier-mache, wire, and plenty of feathers . He says, 'The St Mary’s Children’s Hospital prank was carefully set up over a period of several weeks, where we assessed how often visitors went to the hospital and what times they were most likely to appear. 'Once we were confident that our unfortunate victims were most likely to appear during a certain day and time, we lay in wait. 'We pranked about six people during the day, and the first three reactions were the most dramatic to share. 'Reactions were consistent with fight or flight, people either slamming doors shut, barricading and screaming at the Owlman to leave or escaping out of the hospital at top speed.

"(CNN) -- A Kosovar man was arrested overseas and faces charges of participation in a terror plot involving several suspects from North Carolina, federal authorities said Thursday. Bajram Asllani, 29, a resident of Mitrovica, Kosovo, is charged with providing material support to terrorists and conspiring to murder, kidnap, maim and injure people abroad, the Department of Justice said in a statement. He was arrested early Thursday in Kosovo on a provisional U.S. arrest warrant from the Eastern District of North Carolina. The United States will seek his extradition, authorities said. If convicted, he faces a maximum of 40 years in prison. ""People who are plotting to harm America and Americans are no longer a world away from us.  This case began in Raleigh, N.C., and now stretches across the globe, a circumstance no one would have thought possible less than ten years ago,"" said Owen D. Harris, special agent in charge of the FBI in North Carolina, in the statement. Eight people were indicted last year in North Carolina on terror-related charges. According to a criminal complaint unsealed Thursday, Asllani was a member of the same conspiracy. The April 19 criminal complaint, unsealed Thursday, alleges Asllani ""solicited money from the conspirators to establish a base of operations in Kosovo for the purpose of waging violent jihad"" and ""accepted funds from the conspirators to help him travel."" Kosovo, which declared independence more than two years ago, was once a restive province of Serbia with a majority ethnic Albanian population. Islam is Kosovo's dominant religion in the Balkan nation. The complaint alleges that Hysen Sherifi, one of the eight indicted last year, left Raleigh for Pristina, Kosovo, in 2008 ""to pursue violent jihad"" and formed a relationship with Asllani while in Kosovo. Asllani allegedly provided Sherifi with videos to recruit militants and directed Sherifi to collect money to buy land, where weapons can be stored and a base of operation could be established. The department said Sherifi returned to the United States, collected money and received a $15,000 check but was arrested before he could take the money back to Kosovo. The complaint also alleges Asllani received money from Sherifi for the purpose of obtaining travel documents. ""Sherifi often referred to Asllani as 'the brother' in Kosovo who was advising him and who was 'wanted.'  According to the complaint, Asllani had been arrested by Kosovar law enforcement in 2007 and been placed on house arrest for a period of time. He was later convicted in absentia by a Serbian court in September 2009 for planning terrorist-related offenses and was sentenced to eight years of confinement,"" the department said. Sherifi, a native of Kosovo, is a U.S. legal permanent resident in North Carolina. Five of those indicted are classified as U.S. citizens who are residents of North Carolina: Daniel Patrick Boyd, Zakariya Boyd, Dylan Boyd, Ziyad Yaghi, and Mohammed Omar Aly Hassan. Others indicted are Anes Subasic, a naturalized U.S. citizen and resident of North Carolina, and Jude Kenan Mohammad, a U.S. citizen. The complaint says Daniel Boyd wanted to help Sherifi raise money. ""Boyd stated he wanted to send his sons, Zakariya Boyd and Dylan Boyd, and himself to Kosovo after Sherifi returned.  Zakariya and Dylan Boyd spent time online with Sherifi chatting with Asllani in Kosovo,"" the department said. Another indictment last year added new charges against Daniel Patrick Boyd, Hysen Sherifi and Zakariya Boyd. It alleged that Daniel Boyd and Sherifi conspired to murder U.S. military personnel in a plot to attack troops at the Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia. The three were also charged with weapons possession.","Man seized in Kosovo, charged with providing material support to terrorists .

"Beijing (CNN) -- It is a striking image that in an instant crystallizes the passions and anger on the streets of Beijing. A man is leaning out of the sunroof of a car driving down a six-lane freeway, holding a massive Chinese flag in one hand and, in the other, a portrait of Mao Zedong. ""The islands are ours,"" he yells, referring to China's claim on what it calls the Diaoyu islands. He denounces Japan, and others in the car raised clenched fists, threatening to go to war. Protests have flared for another day across the country. This is not just any day, it is the anniversary of the incident that set off the Japanese invasion of China in 1931. The wounds of history run deep amongst generations raised on stories of the brutality of Japanese occupation. The row over the islands is tearing at those old scars. These are indeed confused times; old-style Maoism, anti-Japanese hatred, ancient territorial claims and a rich nation's hunger for national resources are fueling passionate and at times violent protests aimed at the Japanese. The islands dispute is a magnet for a grab bag of competing agendas. Japanese plants close amid Chinese fury . The open displays of anti-Japanese fury, say some China watchers, is a convenient distraction for the Communist Party as it grapples with a fraught leadership transition marked by political scandal, murder, ""disappearances"" and infighting. The appearance of the iconic Mao images lends a revolutionary fervor to these protests. The father of China's Communist Party is not seen as synonymous with the new economic powerhouse. He harks back to a more brutal time. But this is not just about anger and pride, it is about money. Lying beneath the uninhabited islands are vast natural resources. China is hungry for oil and gas to power its economy. But most of the argument here is framed around history; unfinished business with Japan and China's rising economic significance in the world. Chinese analysts like Guo Xiangjiang, the Deputy Director of the China Institute of International Studies, say there should be no question about who owns the islands. ""There shouldnÂ¹t be any discussion on Diaoyu island. It has always been a part of China,"" he says. China says its claim on Diaoyu extends back hundreds of years. Japan says China ceded sovereignty when it lost the Sino-Japanese war in 1895. Japan's surrender in World War II clouded the issue again. How a remote rock split China and Japan . But in 1972, the United States returned Senkaku to Japanese control as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa. China refuses to recognize these agreements. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman, Hong Lei, has effectively told the U.S. to keep out of the issue. ""We hope that the U.S. can earnestly honor its principle of not taking positions on the Diaoyu issue,"" he said. On the streets it is all about Japan. Thousands marched outside the Japan embassy in China Tuesday. ""Kill Japan!"" one woman yells. Another turns the question on us. ""Would you not fight for Hawaii? Would you not fight for Washington D.C? Of course we will fight for Diaoyu,"" the protester asks. China normally clamps down on protests like this. Public displays of anger are not allowed.

"Tiny creatures hidden inside oil on Earth could help researchers find alien life in deep space, researchers claim. German scientists believe that have discovered microbes living within droplets of water found within a lake in Trinidad and Tobago. Their discovery suggests that life could exist within similar ponds in distant moons such as Saturn's satellite Titan. Scientists believe that have discovered microbes living within droplets of water found within Lake Pitch . The find was made on Pitch Lake, located at La Brea in the southwest of the country, which is the largest natural deposit of asphalt in the world. The lake is a source of oil - it rises to the surface, where it solidifies and forms a hard crust. Scientists had previously believed oil was too toxic to support life, they thought it could only thrive at the boundary where oil and water meet. The study renews hopes of finding alien life on Titan. Last year, measurements of a big sea on Titan (pictured here in front of Saturn) revealed it contained about 5,590 cubic miles (9,000 cubic km) of mostly liquid methane. This equivalent, say scientists, to about 40 times the proven reserves of oil and gas on Earth . The study suggests found that a range of microbes could survive within water droplets in the oil itself . Life on Earth may have come from deep underground, rather than from the surface, according to a study of our planet’s deep subterranean. Last year, researchers found microbes living and reproducing as deep as 5km (3.1 miles) below ground providing clues to where life on Earth originated some 3.5 billion years ago. The study suggests these microbes may have survived in isolation from the Earth’s surface for billions of years. But this latest study suggests microbes could survive within water droplets in the oil itself. ‘Inside them we found complex microbial communities, which play an active part in oil degradation,” said Professor Rainer Meckenstock from the Helmholtz Zentrum München (HMGU). These water droplets contain a huge range of microbial species which breaks down the oil into different organic substances. The discovery renews hope of finding alien life in Titan, which has hydrocarbon lakes on its surface, Dirk Schulze-Makuch, an astrobiologist at Washington State University in Pullman, told Live Science.

"(CNN)  -- Bill Tilden was a controversial tennis legend who dominated the sport in the 1920s, but died in disgrace. The American achieved fame and fortune through his tennis exploits and befriended Hollywood stars such as Charlie Chaplin, but he spent over a year in jail in the 1940s on a morals charge, which ruined his reputation before his untimely death in 1953. Tilden won his six straight U.S. Open titles from 1920-1925, a record since the tournament abolished the challenge system -- where the champion automatically qualified for the final -- in 1911. Under that system, Richard Sears won the first seven editions of the U.S. Open (then the U.S. National Tennis Championships) in the 1880s. Last year, world No. 1 Roger Federer failed in his bid to match Tilden's record when he was beaten in the final by Juan Martin Del Potro. Tilden, who claimed his seventh U.S. Open title in 1929 as well as being twice a losing finalist, goes down in the history books as one of the greatest tennis players of all time. A relatively late starter, Tilden struggled to get into his college tennis team in Pennsylvania, but years of dedicated practice started to bear fruit after the First World War as he reached the U.S. Open finals of 1918 and 1919. He reached his peak in the 1920s, winning his first U.S. Open title and holding the world number one spot for seven straight years. Tilden also led the United States to a record seven straight Davis Cup titles as well as claiming three Wimbledon titles. His famed ""cannonball"" serves worked particularly well on the fast grass surfaces on which the U.S. Open and Wimbledon were staged. Tilden never won the French Open, being losing finalist in the last year it was held on grass courts, in 1927, and 1930 on clay. He won the last of his 10 grand slam titles at Wimbledon in 1930 before deserting the amateur ranks for the fledging professional circuit . Eventually joined by the likes of Ellsworth Vines, Fred Perry and Don Budge, Tilden remained a star attraction until well into his 40s, filling arenas such as Madison Square Garden in big-money matches. But off the court, Tilden was a controversial figure, battling with tennis officials as his amateur status was called into question, and he was accused of being arrogant and inconsiderate. Tilden, who never married, saw his reputation destroyed in the 1940s when he was found guilty of a morals charge in connection with a minor. He served seven-and-a-half months of a year's jail term, but was arrested again in 1949 after picking up a 16-year-old male hitchhiker. Tilden served a further 10 months for his probation violation and was shunned by the tennis community. His friendship with Hollywood stars such as Chaplin and a love of the theatrical world saw Tilden pour much of his riches into less-than-successful Broadway productions. He died a tragic figure in 1953, having a stroke in Los Angeles as he prepared for a trip to play in the U.S. Pro Championships despite his 60 years of age. Tilden was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1959, and in any polls of all-time great tennis players he always features in the top order.","Bill Tilden holds record of six straight U.S. Open crowns, but was a controversial figure .

"Archaeologists have unearthed hundreds of Roman graves in southwest France, some of which contain skeletons still bound by shackles on their necks and ankles. The incredible excavation is located at a building site about 250m west of the Saintes amphitheatre once used for battles between gladiators and wild animals. Among the hundreds of graves found, five skeletons - four  adults and one child - were found shackled or chained. A skeleton uncovered at the Roman burial site pictured exactly as the individual was buried - with an iron shackle attached to his neck . A wider photo shows the same skeleton - thought to be a man - with a shackle on his ankle as well as his neck . This group of four people were buried head-to-toe in a small, trench-style grave . Dating back to the first and second centuries AD, the grave site is thought to have been an important necropolis used for those massacred at the nearby stadium. Three skeletons were found with iron chains attached to their legs, another was buried in a crude shackle around his neck and a child was found with a device on its wrist. Several of the graves were found to be mass burials - pictures show individuals buried side-by-side, head to toe in trench-style graves. The site was first identified as a possible necropolis last year and scientists are now hoping they can establish the individuals' cause of death. Roman necropoleis were usually constructed in the country as a site for burials and cremations to take place away from tombs built within a city. In this photo, another skeleton can be seen buried with a shackle still attached to its ankle . Unfortunately, the graves at Saintes have yielded almost no artefacts or possessions. Only a few vases were found with the remains of one man, and a child was found with coins resting on his eyes. Roman custom was to place coins on the eyes of the deceased so the person's spirit could pay the ferryman to take them across the river Romans believed divided the world of the living and that of the dead. The period of Roman rule across what is now France is commonly referred to as Gallo-Roman, and the graves discovered in Saintes this week fall within this category. The period in which the graves were used - the first and second centuries AD - corresponds to a time in history when Saintes' was a thriving Roman town. It was established as a regional capital during this period because of its location where the major road between Lyon and Acquitaine met with the Charente River. It is famed for its Roman Colosseum-style arena, which when completed, held up to 18,000 people. Construction on the area started during the reign of Tiberius (14 - 37AD) and finished under Claudius (41 - 54AD). It is the largest and oldest remaining Roman amphitheatre in France.","Archaeologists have discovered hundreds of graves at ancient Roman site .

"(CNN) -- A line of sailors teeter on the edge of a giant yacht, peering down at the blazing orange island reflected on its lurching hull. The sailboat slices through the gray Mediterranean, passing the Italian island of Capri at just the right moment to catch a dazzling silhouette on its exposed underbelly. It's an incredible image, captured by Malta photographer Kurt Arrigo as he leaned out of a low-flying helicopter during the Rolex Volcano Race earlier this year. Arrigo has just been named winner of the prestigious World Yacht Racing Forum Image of the Year competition in Gothenburg, Sweden, chosen from an elite pool of internationally renowned sailing photographers. Arrigo said of the winning picture: ""The weather had been bad all day, but the sun suddenly came out for a short while."" ""We were leaving the area but I asked the pilot of the helicopter to fly back briefly over the leading boat -- that's when I took this photograph."" Veteran racing photographer Christian FÃ©vrier said the image would have been impossible 20 years ago, as film cameras would have struggled to capture a yacht racing so quickly with the same stunning level of clarity. ""The reflection at twilight in the hull was interesting. But the importance of the crew creates a second point of interest,"" he said of the lauded image. The fifth annual competition, sponsored by Mirabaud & Cie Private Bankers, is only open to professional photographers, this year attracting 46 of the best racing images from 2012. The spectacular photos captured some of the biggest events in the sailing calendar, from brutal waves bombarding competitors in the America's Cup to the festive atmosphere of the London Olympics. Competitors were judged on technical elements such as clarity, lighting, composition, and also originality. ""If you look at the images, hardly any could be taken by someone who's not heavily involved in the industry,"" Bernard Schopfer, one of the organizers of the event, said. ""Very often you have to be hanging out of a helicopter with no door or on board the racing boat in extremely violent conditions. It's also an investment to have the right equipment that can withstand the salt water."" The impressive images were whittled down to the top five by delegates from the World Yacht Racing Forum. The difficult task of choosing a winner was then decided by a panel of industry heavyweights. Judges included two-time sailing Olympic gold medalist and CNN Main Sail broadcaster Shirley Robertson. Ben Ainslie, who won his fourth sailing Olympic gold at London 2012, also sat on the panel, adding that the moving photographs had ""paid a great tribute to the variety and richness of the sport of sailing."" Arrigo, who has already published two photography books on his native Malta, was awarded a trophy at the event.","Malta photographer Kurt Arrigo wins World Yacht Racing Forum Image of the Year .

"The BTK serial killer is helping to write a book about his heinous crimes because he believes people need to know how a criminal mind works. Dennis Rader, 69, is currently serving 10 consecutive life sentences for 10 murders in Wichita, Kansas, between 1974 and 1991. He earned the moniker BTK killer as details emerged that he consistently 'bound', 'tortured', then 'killed' his victims - none of which his wife knew about until he was charged. Book deal: BTK killer Dennis Rader, 69, revealed he has been working on a book with a professor about his mind. He was dubbed BTK because he bound, tortured and killed his 10 murder victims from 1974 to 1991 . Letter: In a handwritten message dated 29 September, Rader revealed the news himself . Now, the father-of-two and former church leader has vowed to claims he plans to help the families monetarily by assisting a University of Pennsylvania professor on a book studying his mind. In a handwritten open letter from his cell in El Dorado Correctional Facility, Kansas, Rader revealed the news. 'The main reason for the book idea, is to help the VF's (Victims Fund) monetarily wise; something I had hoped for years, to help them and in a way to pay my debt to them,' Rader wrote, according to Kansas News. 'I can never replace their love ones, my deeds too 'dark' to understand, the book or movies, etc. is the only way to help them. 'I mean to burn no bridges and hope some day to open up. 'People like me, need to be under stood, so the criminal professional field, can better under stand, the criminal mind. That would be my way helping debt to society.' He adds that he cannot say very much because he is barred from making or fueling profits from his crimes, but he knows the book is 'close to a deal'. Inspired: The new movie A Good Marriage that hit theaters yesterday was inspired by Rader lying to his wife . Victims: These pictures show eight of his victims, ranging in age from 21 to 62, in Wichita, Kansas . Following his arrest, several of the victims' relatives sued Rader, and secured a settlement that agreed he can never profit from his crimes or coverage of them. The non-fiction book will not be sensationalist, author Katherine Ramsland insists, and Rader will not profit from it. 'I'm trying to make this a serious effort that will have some benefit for people who study this kind of crime,' she said. That work involved correspondence with Rader, she explained. His words come after his daughter broke the family's nine-year silence to condemn a film by Stephen King allegedly inspired by Rader's secrets, as his wife never knew about the murders. Kerri Rawson, has said King is 'exploiting' the people her father killed and her own family with his new film, A Good Marriage. Dispute: Rader's 36-year-old daughter Kerri Rawson (right) broke the family's nine-year silence to condemn author Stephen King (left) for his book and film that she claims exploits the victims' families and her family . The movie, which hit theaters on October 3, is about a woman who is unaware her husband is a serial killer. It is based on a short story the author wrote in 2010, which he then adapted for the screen. While promoting the film, King has said on programs like The View that he was inspired by the BTK killer when he came up with the idea for the story, about a man whose own family was unaware of the horrible atrocities he had committed. Rawson, 36, and her family were also unaware her father was a killer. 'He’s exploiting my father’s 10 victims and their families,' Rawson told the The Kansas City Star. She then said of her father, 'He is not worth all the books and the news stories and all the attention.' Rader responded in his letter: 'I'm sorry my daughter is upset, I would be too.' He added that his wife Paula did not know about the crimes, adding: 'The family knew nothing about my ‘Dark Deeds.’ I carried that secret until the day I was arrested.'","Dennis Rader, 69, is collaborating with professor on study of his mind .

"(CNN) -- A 9-year-old girl accidentally killed a shooting instructor with an Uzi on Monday, authorities in Arizona said, and now the world is asking itself an absolutely absurd question: Should a fourth-grader be legally allowed to shoot an Uzi? The only answer to that question is: Hell fricking NO -- it should be against the law. Understand, I love shooting guns and so do my kids. My favorite gun is a 12-gauge over/under shotgun. Our teenage daughters prefer a .22 because it's easier to aim and control. Other than hooking a large brown trout, there's nothing more thrilling in my book than pulling the trigger on a shotgun and managing to hit a target. Kids and guns: What's your parenting style? But this is not a shotgun. This is a fully automatic machine gun developed by the Israeli army. It is capable of firing 600 to 650 bullets a minute. As this Uzi pumps out 10 bullets a second, the kickback is substantial. It is designed to be fired by a soldier during war, not a fourth-grader on vacation. It's too powerful, it's too big and it's too deadly. Many adult novices can't control that weapon. The Mohave County Sheriff, Jim McCabe, said the full video of the incident was, as one might imagine, ""ghastly."" This, of course, isn't the little girl's fault; was it even her idea to shoot an Uzi in the first place? It's the instructor and the parents who are to blame -- I mean, what could possibly go wrong if you hand an Uzi with the selector on fully automatic mode to a 9-year-old? For anyone who asks ""What were they thinking?"" the answer is: They weren't. That's why the law needs to change -- to protect kids from adult stupidity. This all seems particularly senseless to me because just two weeks ago on our own family vacation, we introduced our own 9-year-old to the joys of target shooting and the responsibility of gun safety. Here's a photo of our son, supervised by instructors and with my father behind him on his first day at the range. Notice what's happening. He's sitting down, so he can absorb any kick. He's got on safety glasses and sound protection. The gun is resting against a table and the strap of the gun has been put around a railing on the table to hold it down. Why do you take these precautions? Because when you introduce kids to the sport of shooting guns, you are taking on a great responsibility. This 9-year-old girl isn't the only child to kill someone with an Uzi. An 8-year-old boy in Massachusetts killed himself a few years ago when he fired an Uzi at a gun show, while supervised by his own father. The gun kicked up on the boy, and he shot himself in the head. The laws didn't change in Massachusetts, and I'm sure the National Rifle Association will see to it that they don't change in Arizona. But they should. Arizona laws require a person to be at least 21 years old to carry a firearm, but the laws do not apply on private property or if the minor is accompanied by a parent or certified instructor. Kids can't drive until they're 16, vote, chew tobacco or smoke until they're 18, or drink until they're 21. No child should have access to firing a fully automatic weapon until the age of 18. And gun ranges should know better than to hand one to a novice shooter passing through on vacation, let alone one as young as 9. The tragedy took place at Bullets and Burgers, where the website states ""At our range, you can shoot FULL auto on our machine guns. Let 'em Rip!"" Just because you can doesn't mean you should.","Mel Robbins: Gun instructor's death raises absurd question: Should kids fire Uzis?
She says of course not! If kids learn about guns, should be in controlled safe environment .

Instead, they want them to be looked after in their own homes or smaller residential centres nearby. The plans have been drawn up in the wake of the abuse of residents at Winterbourne View, a private hospital for adults with learning difficulties near Bristol. Last year a BBC Panorama documentary exposed how staff routinely tortured and abused vulnerable patients. The facility has since been closed and six staff jailed. Although the Government does not think abuse on this scale is widespread, there is concern that hundreds of patients are being poorly looked after in similar institutions. Many are sedated with high-dose drugs or forcefully held down if they become upset and aggressive. There are currently 1,200 adults and children with learning disabilities placed in what are known as assessment and treatment centres. But over the next two years the Government wants to reduce the number of patients to between 300 and 400, and to ensure that they only stay for a few weeks at a time. Instead, ministers want local councils and NHS bodies to enable patients to be looked after in their own homes or to be  housed in small, local, centres. Care services minister Norman Lamb said: ‘There has to be a complete culture change. Would we tolerate someone with cancer getting the wrong sort of treatment or wrong sort of care? ‘No, we wouldn’t, and yet for too long we have tolerated people with learning disabilities being put in the wrong settings. Scandal: A BBC Panorama documentary last year exposed abuse at Winterbourne View private hospital in Bristol . Abuse: The investigation exposed how vulnerable patients suffered terrible treatment . ‘They are living in large hospitals, completely inappropriately, where they are put under stress and strain, where their behaviour is inevitably affected.’ Many of these hospitals are privately owned and ministers fear they may be ‘profiting from others’ misery’. They want the owners and boards of directors at these firms to face prosecution if the hospital is found to be abusing or neglecting patients. Mr Lamb added: ‘When you look at Winterbourne View, the people who committed the abuse and the assaults were convicted, but what about the people making the money from that company?’ The Government has also instructed the Care Quality Commission watchdog to carry out unannounced inspections of these hospitals next year. Those found to be failing will be closed down and staff will face prosecution. And in June 2014, NHS organisations and councils will have to have drawn up a care-plan for each patient based on their needs. In most cases these will state they should be looked after in their own home or local residential centre. Organisations will have to provide a ‘justification’ whenever people continue to be housed in a hospital.","Ministers want more people with learning disabilities to be treated at home rather than private hospitals and care homes .

"It is is the image that could dramatically improve your online dating. Experts have analysed the online dating profiles to find out what works best. The most effective keywords, they say, are surfing, yoga, skiing and the ocean. The key to online dating:  A new study has revealed the top keywords, along with the best way to take a profile pic . The team also analysed the 400 most popular profiles, and found there were keys to which profile pictures worked best. 'If you’re a gay man, pose outdoors—48 percent of the profile pics of the most popular gay men on OkCupid were snapped outside. (It was 80 percent in Atlanta!),' the researchers said. 'Selfies are acceptable for women (45 percent of top-ranking straight women used them, as did 4 percent of lesbians), but not so much for men.' Source: Wired.com . The chart shows 380 of the top 1000 most commonly used words in profiles on OkCupid. 'Working with data crunchers at the dating sites, we analyzed the 1,000 most popular words on both men and women’s profiles, tabulated the most popular movies and TV shows, and crunched stats on what people consider their best feature vs. what features their potential dates are attracted to,' the team at Wired said. The team also analysed the 400 most popular profiles, and found there were keys to which profile pictures worked best. A previously study found an outdoorsy full-length shot is best for men, while indoor body pictures get women 60% more message. The new study added that gay men enjoyed particular success with an outdoor shot, and that selfies were only acceptable for women. 'If you’re a gay man, pose outdoors—48 percent of the profile pics of the most popular gay men on OkCupid were snapped outside. (It was 80 percent in Atlanta!),' the researchers said. 'Selfies are acceptable for women (45 percent of top-ranking straight women used them, as did 4 percent of lesbians), but not so much for men.' 'Mentioning cats is fine, but mention 'my cats' and you’re a weirdo. 'The data shows that lesbians appreciate nice legs, gay men prize nice arms, and straight women and men are looking for flat stomachs above all else.' Why are outdoor photos of men likely to be more popular, but less so for women? Men prefer indoor-selfies of women because they look pretty in them - the lighting is flattering and soft, and the whole mood of a home selfie is intimate and slightly private. It's sexy!Women prefer outdoors shots of men because they're likely to be taken by a friend (which shows that he's social and popular), and probably show him doing something active and rugged (which we also like).Why are profile pictures with more than one person in them a turn-off? At match.com, we've found that people simply don't have time to study a photograph to work out which one is you! It's also far less intimate and attractive to use a group shot - always remember that the person viewing your profile will be trying to imagine themselves with you. Not you and your legions of friends.  It's the online equivalent of bringing your mates along on a first date. Why should you speak more about your own interests than what you're looking for in a partner? Because people viewing your profile will be hoping to get a sense of your lifestyle - and how they can fit into it. They don't want to feel like an item on a supermarket shelf that you might simply pass by because it's not on your list.  Describe yourself as a person - how you like to spend your time, what you love to do. That's attractive. Why is spelling important? Good spelling implies you're intelligent but more importantly it shows you've taken care and effort writing your profile. A hastily-written page full of abbreviations suggests you're not taking it seriously, or that it's something you flung up online while you were bored. That suggests you won't take dating seriously either. Good spelling shows that you are thoughtful and considered.","Wired found the most effective 300 keywords on okcupid and match.com .

"(CNN)  -- Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho has been given a one-game touchline ban with another suspended after two of his players received late red cards in their Champions League win over Ajax last week. Midfielder Xabi Alonso and right-back Sergio Ramos were both sent off in the dying moments of Real's win in Amsterdam after getting second yellow cards for inexplicable acts of time-wasting with their team leading 4-0. ""The Spanish club's coach Jose Mourinho has been suspended from coaching activities for two UEFA club competition matches, of which the second is deferred for a probationary period of three years. He was also fined €40,000, UEFA announced on its website Tuesday. UEFA confirmed that the punishments were for ""improper conduct"" but gave no further details. Five-star Barcelona thrash Real Madrid . The dismissal of the pair leaves them banned for Real's final Group G match with Marseille, which is of no consequence with the team already qualified for the last 16. Press speculation has suggested that the sendings off were deliberate to give themselves a disciplinary clean state for the crucial knockout stages. Alonso and Ramos were also both fined by UEFA, while goalkeeper Iker Casillas and reserve keeper Jerzy Dudek were punished after being shown on television allegedly passing messages to them from the dugout. Spanish international teammates Alonso and Ramos were fined €20,000 each, with a €10,000 fine given to Casillas while Dudek was ordered to pay €5,000 . ""The red cards given to Alonso and Ramos stand, and they have therefore been suspended for one UEFA club competition match,"" added UEFA. Nine-time European champions Real were also fined €120,000 over the club and have three days to launch an appeal. The ban completes a miserable 24 hours for Portuguese boss Mourinho after seeing his side thrashed 5-0 by arch-rivals Barcelona in El Clasico on Monday night.","Jose Mourinho receives one-game touchline ban from Champions League with a second suspended .

"At the school my two eldest children go to they have a unique form of parental torture surely invented purely to make my life a misery once a year. ‘Open Homework’: these two words do not belong together do they? Like ‘sugar’ and ‘free’ or ‘drink’ and ‘moderation’ they should never be in the same sentence. So, what, exactly is ‘Open Homework’? Well, it’s just like normal homework — only worse. Lorraine has recently come into contact with 'Open Homework' which has seen her attempt various dubious tasks including knitting in order to encourage her daughter's creative thinking . It’s the kind of homework the tyrannical teacher from Matilda would set; Miss Trunchbull homework. The idea behind Open Homework is to encourage creative free-thinking in a young mind (a dangerous concept to start with for my rebellious pre-teen girls). What happens is a subject is given and you can do whatever you want with it: build a sculpture, write an essay, set it to music, turn it into performance art, make an omelette; anything as long as you can explain the mental acrobatics which helped you come up with your idea in the first place. Lorraine says that working full-time and Open Homework does not mix . Past themes of this annual working-mum-stress-increaser have included ‘flight’ and ‘black and white’. I marvel at some of the pupils’ resulting creations, really I do. Even though parents are forbidden from helping, some of the work is so magnificent it looks like it has been handed in by architect Zaha Hadid or crafted by Professor Brian Cox. Ours, however, tend to end up looking like they’ve been made in the craft room at a lunatic asylum by an inmate with questionable motor skills. This is because I really do try not to help, despite Open Homework sucking up most of my evenings and once waking me up in the middle of the night with a nightmare about the toddler getting hold of the wood glue and sticking a rug to the floor. This project throws me into a week-long Sunday-night-gloom, looming large in the lengthy daily to-do list because my children enthusiastically throw everything they have got at it. When I suggest a little editing of their ideas, some focus perhaps, or possibly a less ambitious ‘build’, as Kevin from Grand Designs would say, I am shushed. I am sent out with a shopping list that once included ‘something that looks like a bug’s eye’. We’ve made board games, built aeroplanes and once Gracie asked me to construct a life-size model of a Friesian cow. Even Blue Peter couldn’t do that, I say, but she replies: ‘Maybe we could knit one and stuff it.’ In a busy household of four children aged three to 12, this kind of project takes over. Bits of the different creations are to be found drying/setting/cooking everywhere. On Sunday I heard Gracie describing Open Homework to her grandma on the phone: ‘It’s this fun thing we do that Mum hates,’ she said. ‘Mum sort of comes up with an idea and then we do it for her.’ I feel the meaning of the mission has been lost. This year we have the number ‘100’ as the theme — no doubt inspired by the centenary of the war. Of course Gracie does not want to do something so obvious as this anniversary. ‘God mum, everyone will do that,’ she says. And so begins the fraught discussion of ideas. She will have ten, develop five into an embryonic project for which all manner of empty jam jars, egg boxes, candles and silver paint will be required. By day three of Open Homework I will feel like lying down in the middle of the road clutching a sign saying ‘do not resuscitate’ as she narrows down her choice to one idea. The girls approach this with far more enthusiasm than any other homework. Perhaps because of my antipathy they love it as much as I fear it. Maybe if I didn’t work I would have more time and enjoy taking part? Maybe not. I find normal homework, especially maths, gruelling but this no-rules homework pains me more. And we never have enough glue. We have now come up with an idea after hours of discussion. Does anyone know where I can get something that looks like a small marsupial?

"Madrid (CNN) -- A 24-year-old Australian man was gored in the thigh Friday, the second day of the annual running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain. At least three other runners went to hospital with injuries, officials said. The Australian man was gored in the bullring at the end of the course. One bull became separated from the pack and came last, and alone, to the bull ring. Television images showed the man coming up behind the lone bull, which then turned on the man, who suddenly slipped and fell to the ground. He was then gored in the thigh. He was immediately tended to the bullring medical staff. A hospital report on all the injured is due later. Four runners went to the hospital with injuries Thursday on the first day of the running of the bulls. Commentators on Spanish state television TVE considered it a relatively safe start to the dangerous annual tradition in Pamplona, which has tallied thousands of injuries and 15 deaths since record-keeping began in 1924, including the fatal goring of a Spanish man in 2009. The run in Pamplona started 400 years ago and became popular worldwide after author Ernest Hemingway wrote about it in the 1920s in his book ""The Sun Also Rises,"" also published under the title ""Fiesta."" It is now broadcast live across Spain by state television TVE, which pays Pamplona for exclusive rights, and positions some 20 cameras along the course. The daily run continues for eight days, through July 14, at 8 a.m. (2 a.m. ET). It is the highlight of the San Fermin festival in Pamplona that attracts hundreds of thousands to the nonstop fiesta.","The Australian man is gored in the bullring at the end of the course .

"(CNN) -- Police and health officials have raided a slaughterhouse and meat company in the United Kingdom as part of an ongoing investigation into horse meat that was labeled as beef, authorities said Tuesday. The West Yorkshire slaughterhouse is believed to have supplied horse carcasses to a firm called Farmbox Meats Ltd., which then sold the meat as beef for kebabs and burgers. Authorities have suspended operations at both facilities and seized all remaining meat and company files, which include a client list. Neither company was immediately available for comment. ""I ordered an audit of all horse-producing abattoirs in the UK after this issue first arose last month and I was shocked to uncover what appears to be a blatant misleading of consumers,"" said Andrew Rhodes, Food Standards Agency director of operations. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson called the revelations ""absolutely shocking."" ""It's totally unacceptable if any business in the UK is defrauding the public by passing off horse meat as beef,"" he said. ""I expect the full force of the law to be brought down on anyone involved in this kind of activity."" Horse meat was discovered in products that are supposed to be 100% beef sold in Sweden, the United Kingdom and France. While authorities said there is no immediate cause for health concerns, the discovery was a new shock to an industry already reeling from a bombshell last month, when Irish investigators found horse and pig DNA in numerous hamburger products. Investigations are under way in France, Sweden and Britain. The supply chain being studied includes more countries. Earlier this month, Britain's National Beef Association called for more specific labeling of meat products and asked that the words ""United Kingdom origin"" be printed on packaging.

"Melbourne (CNN) -- The two hosts of the 2Day FM Sydney radio program will be feeling awful. In seeking to con their way into recording a telephone call with a patient receiving treatment in a hospital they were doing what they thought FM radio hosts do. Everyone else does prank calls so we'll do one too. The position of the radio station is different though. This Sydney radio station has a track record of attempting to garner large ratings through shock tactics. In 2009 on this very same radio station a 14-year-old girl was invited into the studio with her mother. She was wired up to a lie detector and asked personal questions. This was considered a jape. To take that jape just that potential ratings point further, the young girl was asked about her sex life. A reminder: she was 14. Obviously intimidated by the occasion, the fame of the hosts and the setting, she revealed to the vast audience listening at home and in cars that she had been raped when she was 12. The incident was investigated by the Australian Communications and Media Authority which imposed an additional condition on 2Day FM's licence that it increase the protection of children participating in its shows. One of the hosts of that broadcast, who is still employed by the radio station, said that early in his career he was told by the program director to ""do whatever you want, just win,"" according to the transcript of an interview he did with Radio Today. Do whatever you want. But you know what? Actually, you can't do whatever you want. It may come as a surprise to many but there is actually a code of conduct for Australian radio stations and their on air presenters. It is called the Commercial Radio Codes of Practice Code 6 which currently makes compelling reading: . ""The purpose of this Code is to prevent the unauthorized broadcast of statements by identifiable persons. 6.1 A licensee must not broadcast the words of an identifiable person unless: . (a) that person has been informed in advance or a reasonable person would be aware that the words may be broadcast; or . (b) in the case of words which have been recorded without the knowledge of the person, that person has subsequently, but prior to the broadcast, expressed consent to the broadcast of the words."" Jacintha Saldanha was not aware in advance that her words might be broadcast. Of course she wasn't, she thought she was talking to the Queen. And I'll confidently assert that she didn't subsequently consent to her words being broadcast, because if she did we would have heard all about it by now. The CEO of the radio network says, ""nobody could have reasonably foreseen"" that a prank their station pulled on a nurse at the hospital, could have resulted in her suicide. That's probably right. But could they have reasonably foreseen that she would be upset? Personally and professionally embarrassed? Hurt? But the lawyers ran their $750 an hour rulers over it and broadcast it was. So what best describes the relationship between the radio station and Jacintha Saldanha? In 1946 Terence Rattigan wrote a play called The Winslow Boy. An English family of modest means consigns itself to potential penury by securing legal representation for the young son of the family who stands falsely accused of petty theft at his naval academy. The lawyer they retain to defend him, the best in the land, is Sir Robert Morton. In a speech addressing the boy's many doubters and accusers Sir Robert urges them, in considering this case involving a young boy on one side and the British Navy on the other, to remember a famous old dictum: ""you shall not side with the great against the powerless."" In this whole sad and tragic affair Jacintha Saldanha was truly powerless. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion .

"A stroke victim is hoping to smile for the first time in 10 years - with the help of transplanted muscles from her forehead. Sara McKay, 45, suffered a  stroke, leading doctors to diagnose a life-threatening brain tumour. The mother-of-two from Consett in County Durham, has spent years learning to walk and talk again. She lost the ability to smile after the left side of her face was paralysed. Now she has undergone an operation at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary, where surgeons removed muscles from her forehead and replanted them into her left cheek, in an effort to bring some movement back to her face. Sara McKay, 45, from Consett in County Durham has just undergone an operation which could help her smile again, after a stroke and a brain tumour left her paralysed and without movement on the left side of her face. She says her husband George, 43, has been her 'lifeline' Mrs McKay said: 'Hopefully this will try to help my mouth to move, meaning that I can fully smile again. I knew if I didn't get it done, I would always regret it. 'I'm now waiting to see if the operation's been successful; they said it could take a little while.' As her husband George, 43, is in the army, Mrs McKay was living in barracks in Germany when she first fell ill in 2004. She said: 'George was in the Scots Guards and we were living in Munster with our two children. 'In June 2004 I had a stroke and, when tests were carried out, they discovered a brain tumour on my brain stem. 'By the following year the tumour had started to grow and suddenly I was in a 'live or die' situation. 'There was no option but to have an operation to remove it. 'I'd lost all movement down one side and, following the operation, I had to learn how to walk and speak all over again.' Throughout her illness, Mrs McKay said husband George became her lifeline. 'He was always there for me,' she said. 'If it hadn't been for him I don't know how we would have got through everything.' The couple returned from Germany in 2008 and Mrs McKay is continuing with her rehabilitation. Determined not to be beaten, she now goes to the gym and can walk with the help of a stick. Mrs McKay's condition also left her with facial palsy, meaning the left side of her face was paralysed. Surgeons at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle removed muscles from the top of Mrs McKay's forehead and planted them in her cheek in the hope of allowing her to smile . It prevents her mouth from moving on one side, but she has always hoped that one day she would be able to smile again. Finally, this summer surgeons at the RVI removed muscles from the top of her head and planted them in her cheek in the hope of allowing her to smile. She is now waiting to see if the operation will work, and is coping with the help of her husband and two children Samantha, 21, and Robert, 19. Her daughter Samantha said: 'My mum has been through so many operations but always came back fighting strong. 'Dad looked after me and my brother, as well as being deployed to Iraq.

"By . Darren Boyle . A drunken thug who dangled his girlfriend over a major road bridge continued to harass her from behind bars. Adam Scott was jailed for the terrifying incident when he threatened to drop her on to a main road over the pedestrian bridge. But within days he sent letters to his girlfriend from behind bars breaching a restraining order which banned him from any contact with her for life. Adam Scott, pictured, dangled his girlfriend over a pedestrian bridge and threatened to stab her new partner in a letter from behind bars . A court heard the letters were meant to be loving but a judge said one of them threatened the young woman’s new partner by ‘stabbing him in the face’. Scott, 21, was given a suspended jail term after he admitted three breaches of a life long restraining order against his ex lover. But the judge warned him that he will lock him if he makes any contact with his ex-girlfriend again. Exeter Crown Court heard Scott, from Exmouth, Devon, has 27 convictions for 44 offences. Judge Francis Gilbert QC said: 'You have a record for violence and aggressive behaviour, often when in drink.' He said Scott had a restraining order banning him from contact with his father and when he harassed his ex-girlfriend the last time, he also intimidated her and his own mother about giving evidence against him. Adam Scott, 21, dangled his ex-girlfriend from this pedestrian bridge over the main A379 dual carriageway just outside Exeter, Devon . The judge said the latest offences were relevant to what he had done to his ex-girlfriend before. Judge Gilbert said during the bridge incident Scott punched her and pulled her hair before picking her up over the railings and with her head pointing towards the main road below where he threatened to drop her which would have caused her serious injury or worse. A family driving below saw what he was doing and alerted the police and were ‘very shocked by his extreme aggression’. Scott dangled his ex-girfriend from a pedestrian bridge over the A379 just outside Exeter, Devon. The court heard Scott sent her a letter from jail intimidating her saying he held a grudge adding ‘it was far from over and not to underestimate me’. The prosecution said Scott sent three letters to his ex girlfriend in breach of the restraining order in May and July. Judge Francis Gilbert gave Scott a suspended sentence at Exeter Crown Court, pictured, but warned that he would jail the 21-year-old if he tried to make contact with his ex-girlfriend again . Defence lawyer Rupert Taylor said the letters ‘professed his affections for her’ but the judge disagreed saying they caused her ‘considerable harassment’ and threatening to ‘stab’ her new boyfriend ‘in the face’. Mr Taylor said one letter expressed he was ‘truly sorry’ and saying his ex-girlfriend was ‘still the one I miss, love and think about’ but the judge said Scott acted ‘regardless of her wishes’. While Scott wrote telling her she was ‘still the girl I want to spend the rest of my life with’ the judge replied: 'She wants to be left alone. He was jailed for a total of eight months, suspended for two years, and told to pay £100 victim surcharge. The judge warned him that if there are any more breaches of the restraining order he will face more time behind bars, saying: 'You must be very careful.'","Scott had 27 prior convictions relating to 44 earlier offences .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Washington lawyer has filed a lawsuit in federal court, claiming he is the father of basketball star LeBron James. Leicester Stovell alleges that the athlete and his family have been involved in a cover-up to deny paternity by committing fraud and misrepresentation. He told HLN's ""Prime News"" on Thursday that he wants ""a carefully structured and secure DNA test"" to prove he's the NBA all-star's father. Stovell says he has been trying for three years to establish paternity and is seeking $4 million in damages. An earlier test ruled out the possibility, but he said the test could have been tampered with -- ""and there are indications that there was a motivation."" Stovell said he had sex with James' mother, Gloria James, after meeting at a Washington bar while she was visiting from Ohio in 1984. A few months later, she told him she was pregnant, but did not say whether he was the father. Stovell said his only request was that the child, if a boy, play basketball. He said his memory of the encounter resurfaced more than 20 years later, ""after being asked whether I had a son, and I then systematically explored all of my past for that possibility."" ""I came across this set of recollections and in focusing on them, they amplified,"" he said. In the complaint, filed June 23, Stovell says, ""I recently have concluded that a comprehensive, sophisticated and well-funded effort might well have been underway for quite some time, perhaps beginning in its present form as early as when defendant LeBron James was in high school, to frustrate identification of his real father, and that there is a likelihood that the father in question is me."" He stopped short of saying he is certain he is James' father. ""I don't want to make such a definitive statement in the absence of corroborative evidence"" such as DNA, he said. Stovell said he filed the suit two weeks ago because a statute of limitations was about to expire. ""I have some limitation considerations that caused me to want to file the suit before the end of June,"" he said. He denied the timing had anything to do with the current LeBron mania. James is scheduled to announce Thursday evening the team he has chosen to play for next season, a deal worth perhaps tens of millions of dollars or more. He currently plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers. He says he was informed by Gloria James months later that she was pregnant. He claims she told him the child would be named LeBron, similar to Leicester Bryce, Stovell's first and middle names. The lawsuit states Gloria James was 16 at the time of the alleged encounter, but Stovell said she told him she was in her early 20s. Stovell is a solo legal practitioner in the District of Columbia, and filed the lawsuit on his own behalf. A call to LeBron James' attorney, Frederick Nance of Cleveland, Ohio, was not immediately returned. The lawsuit had been filed without much initial publicity, but was reported by the TMZ celebrity website Wednesday. Public records show Stovell is a former government attorney with the Securities and Exchange Commission. He filed a lawsuit in 2002 against the agency, alleging racial discrimination. Federal court records show the case was settled when the commission paid him $230,000, while not admitting fault.

"(CNN) -- Police have arrested a man in the killing of Auburn University freshman Lauren Burk, who died this week, according to the Auburn, Alabama, assistant police chief. Courtney Larrell Lockhart, 23, of Smiths, Alabama, is charged with capital murder during a kidnapping, capital murder during a robbery, and capital murder during an attempted rape, Tommy Dawson said Saturday. The Phenix City Police Department took Lockhart into custody on Friday, police said. Phenix City is about 35 miles southeast of Auburn. Burk, 18, from Marietta, Georgia, was found shot on North College Street, a few miles north of campus, on Tuesday night. She died later at a hospital. Minutes after police responded to the call reporting an injured person and found Burk, they found a car -- which turned out to be Burk's -- on fire in a campus parking lot. Dawson told reporters Friday that authorities think gasoline or another accelerant was used to ignite Burk's car, and police were investigating whether a gas can found in downtown Auburn was connected. Police want to investigate every possible lead, Dawson said. Authorities were still on patrol in the east Alabama campus, he said. The university's Web site said a campus-wide memorial service will be held Monday. The site carried a message from Burk's father, James, which said: ""The Burk family was so proud to have Lauren as an Auburn University student.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Two Gadhafi loyalists and one National Transitional Council fighter were killed Friday in the Abu Salim neighborhood of Tripoli, an NTC member told reporters. A group of about 10 Gadhafi loyalists had entered the streets of Abu Salim waving green flags and holding a picture of the ousted Libyan leader in a move to draw NTC fighters into the neighborhood, which has remained largely loyal to Gadhafi, council member Abdelrazaq Al Aradi said. When anti-Gadhafi forces responded by entering the streets, the loyalists opened fire, Al Aradi said. Afterward, Omar Khadrawi, the assistant to the interior minister, directed a message through reporters to any remaining loyalists. ""Their names have been discovered and the information about them receiving weapons is in the hands of the security now,"" he said. He added that he was offering them ""a last chance"" to hand in their weapons to authorities. On Friday evening, the mood on the streets of the capital was tense. Heavily manned checkpoints dotted the streets en route to Abu Salim. Fighters and area residents told CNN that a small number of Gadhafi supporters started looting and burning cars after Friday prayers. NTC fighters, some drawn from other neighborhoods, responded quickly. Witnesses and fighters said a number of Gadhafi loyalists were detained. Reports conflicted on whether they were armed. Later in the evening, gunshots could be heard in a number of neighborhoods in the city. Al Aradi told CNN separately that NTC fighters think they have captured the organizer of clashes Friday in the Tajoura neighborhood of eastern Tripoli. On Friday, the U.N. human rights office raised the issue of the number of prisoners in Libya and their treatment. ""It could be up to 7,000,"" said Mona Rishmawi, a senior official with the group in Geneva, Switzerland. ""At this stage, there is no police infrastructure, there is no prison authorities. The prison authorities were under the Justice Ministry and, right now, the Justice Ministry is not fully functional."" ""There is allegations and evidence of torture"" in the prisons, she said, citing lawyers, clients and human rights groups. CNN's Raja Razek and Ingrid Formanek contributed to this report.","2 Gadhafi loyalists and a NTC fighter killed, NTC member says .

"The world's only surviving Bronze Age metropolis could disappear within 20 years unless urgent action is taken to preserve it. The 5,000 year old ruins of the ancient city of Mohenjodaro is situated in what is now the province of Sindh in southern Pakistan on the west bank of the Indus River. But the settlement has been left to crumble over the years due to government neglect, a drop in tourism and security issues within the country. The city dates back to 3000BC and was made up of homes with interconnecting rooms, court yards and roads . Experts have now warned that Mohenjodaro is in danger of corroding away completely if a rescue  plan is not drawn up immediately to save it. Officials met in Karachi last week to discuss ways of preserving it. The city dates back to 3000BC and was made up of homes with interconnecting rooms, fired brick walls, court yards, good roads, clean water and even a complex draining system. The advanced example of urban planning was incredibly complex for its time. Gold bracelets and a button which were discovered in the settlement in 1980 - the year Mohenjodaro was declared a World Heritage Site . A statue of a woman (left) and of a king priest (right) discovered in the ancient settlement . These dice are believed to date back to the Bronze Age and reveal a cultured and sophisticated civilisation living in the Indus Valley . There were separate drains for rainwater and sewage which were covered with slabs of limestone to prevent insects. Wells were built for drinking water and clay litter bins even lined the streets. Wheat and barley were stored on . raised platforms to protect them from flooding and a water cooler took . pride of place in a marketplace where people would gather. There was even a large swimming bath complete with dressing rooms - mainly used for keeping clean. Cultured: Artefacts found by archeologists in the settlement included this chess set which is now at the Karachi Museum in Pakistan . A necklace made of Carnelian beads (left) and statue known as a mother goddess both discovered on the site . Restored pottery discovered on the ancient site lines a wall near the ruins of the ancient city of Mohenjodaro . More than 40,000 artefacts have been discovered which reveal a sophisticated society of around 40,000 inhabitants living in the Indus Valley which even had its own system of law. Artefacts include gold jewellery, statues, pottery, games and even a chess set. But little is known about the appearance of men and women in Mohenjodaro. However, a seven inch high stone sculpture discovered in the lower city shows how men might have looked and dressed. The figure's beard is short and neat, . his upper lip is shaved clean, and his hair is tied with a band that . hangs down his back to his shoulder. Experts have warned that the World Heritage Site could disappear within 20 years if a rescue plan is not carried out immediately . Sir John Marshall, the director general of the Archaeological Survey of India, led the team who dug through the sand and mud to uncover the city and thousands of artefacts. But now the walls of this ancient city are crumbling from the base upwards. The salt content in the ground is eating away at the bricks which before had survived thousands of years. Hot summers, cold winters, monsoon rains and humidity have all contributed to the city's major decay. Preservation . work has been carried out since the very first excavations in 1924. Some experts believe the settlement, . which was declared a World Heritage Site in 1980, should be buried again . to stop any further decline. Dr Asma Ibrahim, a Pakistani . archeologist, told The Telegraph: 'There is no department with . expertise, no decisions taken for the last two years. 'The way things are going, it will survive maybe only another 20 years.'","The 5,000-year-old ruins of Mohenjodaro are situated in southern Pakistan .

"By . Hugo Gye . Poignant photographs of the aftermath of the atomic bomb attack on Nagasaki have been unearthed after lying hidden for seven decades. The images were taken by one of Japan's top photographers the day after the explosion, but were then confiscated by the U.S. military in a bid to stop them being used as propaganda. They show the devastated landscape of the formerly thriving city, with lines of refugees looking for shelter and the skeletons of hollowed-out buildings after the bombing, which killed 75,000 residents of Nagasaki. Horror: This never-before-seen picture shows the city of Nagasaki after it was hit be an atomic bomb in August 1945 . Haunting: The photographs show the skeletons of obliterated buildings following the unprecedented blast . Survivors: A woman and child pictured in the aftermath of the attack sporting a dazed look . The pictures were taken by Yosuke Yamahata, the only Japanese photographer to document the aftermath of the atomic bomb attack. He was sent to the city on the morning of the raid on August 9, 1945, to capture photographs to be used for Japanese propaganda. Many of his images became well-known symbols of the historic bombing - but others, taken on a faulty camera, have not been seen since. They were found in a photo album which was confiscated by an American military policeman at the end of the Second World War, but whose significance was only recently discovered by a private owner. Wasteland: A shrine sitting amidst the devastation in another photograph taken by propagandist Yosuke Yamahata . Tenderness: A mother breastfeeds her baby, covered in debris after the Allied attack . Confiscated: This unidentified military policeman took the photo album to stop it being used as Japanese propaganda . An atomic bomb weighing more than 4,000kg was dropped on Nagasaki by parachute from an American B29 Bomber at 11.02 local time on August 9, 1945. Nicknamed 'the Fat Man', it exploded 500m above ground and completely destroyed the city, on the Japanese island of Kyushu. It was the second attack by the United States on a Japanese city in three days. More than 3million leaflets had been dropped over the country from American aeroplanes warning  that atomic weapons would be used 'again and again' unless the war was ended. The Japanese surrendered less than a week later on August 15. Within the first two to four months of the bombings, the acute effects killed 90,000-166,000 people in Hiroshima and 60,000-80,000 in Nagasaki. It is expected to fetch £20,000 when it goes up for auction at Bonhams in New York this week. Tom Lamb, a historian from the auction house, said: 'These photographs come from an album that was put together by an American military policeman who had been sent to police Osaka after the end of World War II. 'The policeman assembled around 250 photographs in the album during his time in Japan and most of them detail his life as a military policeman and around the city. 'But among the photos are 24 that were taken by Yosuke Yamahata, a Japanese photographer whose images of the destruction to Nagasaki became known worldwide. 'The album contains some of Yamahata's most famous images but there are others in the set that have never been seen before. 'It is thought these photos come from a second, faulty camera that Yamahata had with him. 'These photographs started off life as propaganda against the Americans, who wanted very much to cover up what they had just done. 'Censorship was high and so the photos of the destruction were kept under shop counters and handed out surreptitiously. 'At some point it seems the military policeman confiscated the photos from a Japanese citizen in Osaka and put them in his album with no knowledge of their importance. The dropping of the two atomic bombs was the most devastating action the world has ever seen. 'These photos serve as a reminder of the power we hold that keeps the peace. Today's nuclear bombs are 100 times that ferocity of those that fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.'","The photographs were taken by Yosuke Yamahata and used as propaganda by the Japanese .

'My classmates all found jobs in the campus job fairs, but I was refused all the time once the employer saw my left hand.' Surgeons in Changsha, capital of southern China's Hunan Province, managed to amputate a toe and use it to create a fully-functioning finger. The second toe on Ha’s left foot was severed and attached onto his left hand. 'It's not easy to tell the difference if people are not looking at it closely,' said Doctor Lu. 'The only difference is the size of the nail.' Doctor Lu added that it would take three months for the new 'finger' to resume functions. 'I feel my new life is about to start,' said Ha.

"Comedian Andy Zaltzman, pictured, made a joke on Radio 5 Live suggesting there could be a referendum about whether the Queen should be beheaded . A guest on BBC radio made an 'outrageous' joke live on air suggesting there should be a referendum to decide whether the Queen should be beheaded. The shocking comment was made by comedian Andy Zaltzman  during the Christian O'Connell Manifesto show on Radio 5 Live. The remark, played out live at 10am on Saturday, came after the high-profile beheadings of three hostages by ISIS militants and prompted a number of complaints to the broadcaster. A video showing the beheading of Scottish aid worker David Haines - the third western and the first Briton to be beheaded by the extremists - was released on September 14. The first victim, US journalist James Foley, was murdered in a video released on 19 August. Weeks later, a video showing the beheading of Steven Sotloff was also released by the Jihadist group. Another Briton, journalist John Cantlie, is still being held hostage by the militants. Zaltzman - described at the start of the show as a 'super satirist' - was one of three guests who were invited on the show to discuss the independence vote in Scotland. The debate, which also included presenter Dougie Anderson and comedian Lucy Beaumont, involved Mr O'Connell - who also presents a show on Absolute Radio - asking the guests what else there could be referendums about. Zaltzman suggested a vote on whether the Queen should be beheaded. The excerpt has been removed from the repeat of the show on BBC's iPlayer. Listener Becky Robbins, from London, said: 'It was a completely outrageous thing to say, it really is shocking. 'It not only shows a complete lack of respect for the Queen but jokes about beheadings are also insensitive and totally inappropriate. The timing could not be worse. 'This was a live broadcast on a Saturday morning. The BBC really needs to look at itself and take much more care.' A blurb about the show on the BBC states that the presenter and his guests 'rant, cajole, debates and discuss how to make things better, tearing up rules and inventing new ones along the way'. The comment was made on the Christian O'Connell Manifesto, a hour-long show presented by Mr O'Connell, pictured, at 10am on a Saturday . It adds: 'This week's Manifesto is a Scottish independence referendum special - now the results are in, how can we make Scotland better?' After the incident, a BBC spokesman said: 'The Christian O'Connell Manifesto is a light-hearted entertainment programme. 'The comment was made by a guest - comedian Andy Zaltzman - and we have received five complaints.'","Andy Zaltzman made joke on Radio 5 Live's Christian O'Connell Manifesto .

Nancy Lofaro of New Rochelle, New York: ""It wasn't until approximately 30 to 40 minutes after the collision that we finally heard announcements being made, and in English, we heard that they were saying everything was under control ... that there was an electrical problem with the generator. My husband and I looked at each other and said, 'They're full of it. We have to get off this boat.'"" Valerie Ananias of Downey, California: ""I kept telling my parents and I kept telling everybody else, we need to go. Time is of the essence. We need to get on (a lifeboat) as soon as possible because it continued to tilt. What happened was, when we finally got on the lifeboat, it took several minutes to get everybody on ... people were screaming and crying and they had us count."" Keiko Guest of Atlanta, Georgia: ""We managed to get to a lifeboat that wasn't being overrun and the crew tried to keep us back and we felt all this pressure coming from behind ... stampeding, trying desperately to save their lives ... babies crying ... the siren was unbelievable. It was so piercing that the children and babies were screaming at the top of their lungs while everybody else was screaming to try to be heard. It was so chaotic. It was like the disaster movies."" Georgia Ananias of Downey, California:  ""When the ship was listing ... we had to climb up and pull a human chain to pull ourselves up on to a stairwell. ... Another couple turned around and gave me their baby, and said, 'take my baby.' And I held a 3-year-old and I was holding on and the ship was moving and I was afraid the child was going to go down the stairwell. And I knew -- I looked at my husband who's been in the Navy, and he said, 'This is it,' and I handed the baby back to the parents and said, 'Be with your baby.' ""Not one person from the ship assisted us in any matter. There wasn't one officer. We got on a lifeboat that wouldn't function. We were all thrown out of the lifeboat and thrown against the walls of the ship. We crawled down under to try to get on the other side of the ship, because they said that if we got on the other side, we could get a lifeboat. And at the time, the ship shifted again, and we were thrown back. ""We had to crawl back out. We had to climb a 20-foot ladder. ... The real heroes were the people, the other passengers on board that lifted us up. And we had to go through crates of things.

"By . Steve Nolan . PUBLISHED: . 06:04 EST, 6 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:47 EST, 6 January 2013 . Property prices could take another eight years to recover from the recession and regain their 2007 value, according to forecasts by an estate agent. Homeowners in Wales, North Yorkshire and the North West will wait the longest to see the value of their property return to pre-recession value according to Knight Frank. In Wales, prices won't return to their average peak of £154,696 until 2021 with the current market value more than £20,000 down to less than £132,000. Recession hit: Property prices in some areas could take until 2021 to reach pre-recession levels according to estate agent Knight Frank . In both Yorkshire and the North West, prices will not hit 2007 heights again until 2020, in what is likely to be the slowest housing market recovery in economic history. London will see the quickest recovery, with prices expected to return to their 2007 £303,739 average as early as next year. The capital is still regarded as something of a property hotspot in the global market with properties in prime locations rising by more than half since 2009 and up nine per cent during 2012. Overall, there is something of a north-south divide, with prices in the South East to hit peak levels by 2016 and East Anglia by 2017. Grainne Gilmore, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, said: 'Some five years after the start of the financial crisis the housing sector in Britain still does not bear the hallmarks of a fully functioning market. 'Transaction levels have roughly halved since the last market peak in 2007 and are 35 per cent below the 20 year average. 'First time buyers and those further up the ladder are struggling with tighter mortgage lending.' Property prospects . Liam Bailey, head of residential research at the company, said that the double-dip recession and the threat of a triple dip, has helped to 'weigh on purchaser sentiment'. UK-wide, Knight Frank expects it to be 2019 before the nationwide housing market is up to speed, with a 2 per cent increase in sales expected for 2013. Last year wasn't all bad for homeowners depending on where you live and what type of house you own. Those with homes close to the see saw values rise by 56 per cent with the luxury property market seeing price gains of 45 per cent in 2012. London's continuing property boom did not just extend to prime central locations in 2012, with areas such as Wandsworth, Hampstead and Richmond seeing price increases of five per cent. Not coining it in: While London's property market seems to be going from strength to strength due to international demand, the rest of the UK is struggling . Despite . it more than likely being the slowest recovery for house prices from a . recession, the property market has not suffered as sharp a fall as . during recession in the early 1990s, when values dropped by a fifth. This time around, house prices have fallen an average of 12 per cent. Many . of those who bought property expecting a certain profitable return are . having to rethink their plans with the introduction of a seven per cent . rate of stamp duty in March not expected to help the market. Building . society Nationwide said last week that house prices had dropped by just . over a per cent in 2012, with a fall of 0.1 per cent in December alone. That fall reversed 2011's one per cent increase in house prices. The . price of houses in the UK remains just over five times the average . salary but most experts expect the market to remain slow until property . becomes more affordable.","Homeowners in Wales will not see prices recover fully for eight years .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Rafael Nadal continued his winning ways on clay as he reached the quarterfinals of the Barcelona Open with a 6-3 6-1 win over Colombia's Santiago Giraldo on Thursday. The Spaniard's serve was surprisingly broken early by his 54th-ranked opponent, but from 3-3 he dominated the match to set up a clash with French seventh seed Gael Monfils. The 24-year-old has now won 31 consecutive matches on his favored surface, with his last defeat inflicted by Robin Soderling at the 2009 French Open. He already holds the record on clay for his 81-match winning run from 2005-07. Nadal missed last year's event in the Catalan capital but won the title the previous five years, and now has a record there of 27-1. He has a tour-leading 26 match victories this season -- two ahead of Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer, who are not in the draw. Nadal begins Barcelona bid in style . ""I will be playing against one of best players in the world who has reached the semifinals at Roland Garros, so it will be a tough match,"" Nadal said of Friday's clash with Monfils. The 24-year-old Monfils, who reached the last four at the French Open in 2008, moved into the last eight with a 6-4 7-6 (9-7) victory over ninth-seeded compatriot Richard Gasquet. Monfils, ranked ninth, lost in the last 16 at Monte Carlo in his first match in two months following a wrist injury suffered in San Jose which meant he could not take the court for his semifinal in the U.S. event. Fourth seed David Ferrer, who lost to Nadal in the final in the principality on Sunday, reached the last eight with a 6-3 6-2 win over Romania's Victor Hanescu. The 29-year-old next faces a rematch with Jurgen Melzer, who he beat in the semis on Saturday. The Austrian sixth seed progressed after coming from behind to beat Ferrer's 11th-seeded compatriot Albert Montanes 6-7 (2-7) 6-3 6-2. The winner of Friday's Ferrer-Melzer clash will face a Spaniard in the semifinals, with veteran Juan Carlos Ferrero and Nicolas Almagro also going through. Former world No. 1 Ferrero, playing his first event since last September's U.S. Open following wrist and knee surgery, battled past Italy's Simone Vagnozzi 7-6 (7-3) 4-6 6-4. The 31-year-old won this tournament in 2001 and was runner-up four years later when Nadal embarked on his streak of titles. Eighth seed Almagro ended the hopes of former world No. 3 Nikolay Davydenko, beating the the 29-year-old Russian 7-6 (7-2) 6-3. Almagro, 25, won two lower-level events on clay in South America in February before losing a final in Mexico. Another Spaniard, Feliciano Lopez, continued his country's dominance by joining Nadal, Ferrer, Ferrero and Almagro in the last eight. The 29-year-old left-hander beat Japan's Kei Nishikori 6-4 7-6 (7-5) to set up a clash with Croatia's 56th-ranked Ivan Dodic, who knocked out young Canadian 15th seed 7-6 (7-0) 4-6 6-3. Meanwhile, women's No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki marched into the semifinals of the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart after a 6-4 6-1 win over home hope Andrea Petkovic on Thursday. The German, ranked 19th, led 4-2 in the opening set but Wozniacki fought back to avenge last month's defeat at the Miami Masters. The 20-year-old Dane will next play Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska, who beat German wild-card entry Kristina Barrois 7-5 6-3.. Last year's runner-up Samantha Stosur also reached the last four as the fifth seed upset world No. 3 Vera Zvonareva, beating the Russian 2-6 6-3 7-6 (7-3) in two and a half hours. The Australian, losing finalist in last year's French Open, will next face Julia Gorges -- who beat fellow German Sabine Lisicki 6-4 6-4.","Top-ranked Rafael Nadal extends his unbeaten run on clay to 31 matches .

"Michael Carrick has backed David Moyes to prove a success at Real Sociedad and wished his former Manchester United manager good will. Moyes endured a torrid reign in charge of United and was sacked after 10 months as the club fell from champions under Sir Alex Ferguson to seventh in the Premier League. But he is set to restart his career in La Liga and Carrick, who played 40 games for Moyes, said: ‘I am pleased to see him back in the game. I wish him all the best. Michael Carrick (pictured appearing in a selfie at St George's Park) has backed David Moyes in Spain . Moyes was sacked by Manchester United after a tricky 10 months in charge at Old Trafford . 'I hope it goes great for him over there. It's a new challenge for him. He has proven with his track record over the years that he has been successful over such a long period of time. 'He will be frustrated with how things went last year as we all were but I am sure he will bounce back. Hopefully he can over there and do well.’ Carrick is making a comeback of sorts also, looking to earn his first England cap since October 2013 after missing out on last summer’s World Cup. Retirements by Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard mean the 33-year-old is the eldest member of the squad, but he is targeting Euro 2016 and beyond. 'Of course,' he said. 'I don't think this is my last season. The longer your career goes on, the more you appreciate things. You do start seeing the end and that's natural but I am enjoying things at the moment and I feel good. Carrick is making a comeback for England after going over a year without playing for Roy Hodgson's side . Carrick shields possession from Liverpool's Raheem Sterling during England training this week . 'Hopefully I do have a few years left still. I want to make the most of the opportunity now. It's great to be back now especially after the start of the season.' He admits he is frustrated not have won more than 31 England caps and he was disappointed Roy Hodgson failed to take him to Brazil but added: 'I am not complaining about it. I would have loved to have played more games for England but that's not really happened. At the moment I want to make the most of what is happening ahead. 'This is playing for your country. You have the best to choose from. We are fortunate we have had some special players over the years in midfield. It was frustrating. I wish I could have played more but there is no point looking back. I have to look forward and make most of the time I have left.’ Michael Carrick has revealed his brother Graeme was a better player than Wayne Rooney in their younger days. 'I first heard of Wayne when my brother played against him in the Youth Cup,’ said Carrick. 'Wayne was at Everton, Graeme was at West Ham. That was the first time my brother told me about him. 'He said he had the better of him, actually! He said he was going to be a special player, he could tell that then. ‘The goal against Arsenal was the one, that propelled Wayne into everyone's minds.

"Mark Zuckerberg has responded to the recent tragedy that occurred in Paris by recounting a 2010 incident he had with a Pakistani extremist. Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook, 'A few years ago, an extremist in Pakistan fought to have me sentenced to death because Facebook refused to ban content about Mohammed that offended him.' This as a result of the site's promotion of an Everybody Draw Mohammed Day which took place on May 20 of that year. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Mark Zuckerberg (above) has responded to the recent tragedy that occurred in Paris by recounting a 2010 incident he had with a Pakistani extremist . Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook , 'A few years ago, an extremist in Pakistan fought to have me sentenced to death because Facebook refused to ban content about Mohammed that offended him' And while he did not end up being charged with any crime or sentenced to death, the Pakistani government did block Facebook in their country. 'We stood up for this because different voices -- even if they're sometimes offensive -- can make the world a better and more interesting place,' explained Zuckerberg. 'Facebook has always been a place where people across the world share their views and ideas. We follow the laws in each country, but we never let one country or group of people dictate what people can share across the world.' The idea for the day came after Comedy Central decided to censor a not-so-flattering rendering of the prophet on their show South Park. This act was deemed illegal under Pakistani law, where it is a crime to defile the 'sacred name of Mohammed.' This under Islamic Sharia law. Zuckerberg ends his statement by honoring those who lost their lives in Paris, writing; 'My thoughts are with the victims, their families, the people of France and the people all over the world who choose to share their views and ideas, even when that takes courage. ‪#‎JeSuisCharlie‬.' Many Muslims however are taking issue with Zuckerberg's statement, with one, Aftab Ahmed, writing; 'What about all those people in Palestine , Iraq , Afghanistan , Syria died Never seen you condemned about those barbaric acts talk about standing for right Mr Zuckerberg.' He then added; Yet you ban countless pages for posting ""offensive"" things so how can you say that you refuse to let one group silence everyone when Facebook bans pages for posting humor?'

"By . Reuters Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 22:19 EST, 23 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 22:19 EST, 23 September 2012 . If Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has any ambitions to run for president, she is keeping them under tight wraps - and even her husband doesn’t know of her plans. 'I have no earthly idea what she'll decide to do,' her husband, former President Bill Clinton, said on CBS television's 'Face the Nation' on Sunday. Although Hillary Clinton went down to defeat to President Obama in a close primary contest in 2008, she has stayed in the public eye as the president's top diplomat. Power couple: Bill Clinton says he has 'no earthly idea' of whether his wife Hillary will seek the top office in 2016 . In that role, Clinton, who had been a U.S. Senator from New York, has built a reputation as a capable stateswoman and a loyal lieutenant to the president. She is frequently rated as the most popular member of Obama's cabinet. Clinton has said she will step down from her current job whether the president wins re-election to another four-year term on November 6 or not. 'She wants to take some time off, kind of regroup. Write a book,' her husband said. Presidential: Hillary Clinton has built a reputation as a capable stateswoman and a loyal lieutenant to President Obama . However, she is likely to remain an influential voice and questions about her political future will persist. Clinton's support among Dems is firm, and some had hoped Obama would boost his re-election chances by replacing the gaffe-prone Vice President Joseph Biden with her as his No. 2. While she has remained generally outside the political fray during this election season, her husband has seized a prominent role in campaigning for the president's re-election. Even so, Hillary Clinton, who was first lady when her husband was president from 1993-2001, is herself known as one of the Democratic Party's most influential and best-networked insiders. Stateswoman: Hillary Clinton is pictured with Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak in New York on Sunday during the 67th United Nations General Assembly . The former president said that no matter what, there would be a strong crop of Democrats interested in running for the Oval Office in 2016, including governors and members of Congress. 'We've got a lot of able people in our party who want to be president,' he said. However, he said that with his wife's experience in the White House, where she led an unsuccessful effort to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system, on Capitol Hill, and in the administration, there would be no one more qualified than her to run. 'She's the ablest, I know I'm biased, but I think she demonstrated as senator and as secretary of state that she has extraordinary ability,' Clinton said. Backer: If she did choose to run, she could count on the support of Bill Clinton, who says his wife has already demonstrated 'extraordinary ability' to lead .","Hillary Clinton to step down as secretary of state regardless of whether President Obama is elected to a second term .

"Cash on tap: Scarlet Johansson is being paid £243,000 by SodaStream to appear in their advert . When Scarlett Johansson chose her lucrative SodaStream contract over her charity work with Oxfam, it appeared to be an unusual choice. The 29-year-old issued a strong public statement backing the controversial company which operates in the West Bank, despite Oxfam’s claim that the firm profits from illegal trade that harms Palestinians. But The Mail on Sunday has learned the clues to her outspoken position may lie in her family’s struggle with money. The blonde star of The Girl With The Pearl Earring and The Island admits she hankers after wealth and squanders money. And while she commands huge fees for her film appearances, including a reputed £13 million for Avengers 2, she has also amassed a stable of sponsors, with top-brand firms paying her £3 million a year for acting as an ambassador for their goods. ‘It’s nice to have money. I didn’t grow up with it so it’s nice to have it,’ she told The Mail on Sunday. ‘I’m not at all frugal and I don’t save – to my business manager’s dismay. I like to be generous. I can’t stand people who are tight with their money, it drives me crazy. ‘It’s different if you’re scrimping and saving because you need to, to save up for something. But I cannot stand cheapness.’ Johansson, ranked 12th on the Forbes List of the top-earning superstars, grew up in a sprawling subsidised housing complex in a part of Manhattan once nicknamed the Wild West. Her Danish father Karsten, a struggling architect, and her mother Melanie, an Ashkenazi Jew, struggled to pay rent as they raised Scarlett,  her twin brother Hunter and siblings Vanessa and Adrian. Controversial: Johansson, 29, released a strongly-worded statement backing SodaStream . Of her childhood, she said: ‘My father barely made enough to get  by. We moved house every year and finally we settled in a housing development for lower-middle-income families. 'We went to state school and depended on programmes for school lunches and transport.’ Today the family’s once run-down . three-bed apartment in Greenwich Village, bought by Scarlett’s siblings . at a discount under a tenants’ right- to-buy scheme, is worth millions . thanks to gentrification and the booming property market. One . neighbour said: ‘Back then, this was a rough area. We called it the . Wild West and there wasn’t much money around. It’s all changed now.’ Frugal times: Johansson, circled with her siblings, got by on 'barely enough' as a child . SodaStream is said to be paying £243,000 for Johansson’s advertisement, which will be shown live during the Super Bowl today. Her decision to remain linked to the firm, whose factory is in Mishor Adumim, an industrial zone in the Jerusalem hills, has infuriated Oxfam. The charity insists it is incompatible for Johansson to represent both it and SodaStream. It said: ‘Oxfam believes that businesses such as SodaStream that operate in settlements further the ongoing poverty and denial of rights of the Palestinian communities that we work to support. We are opposed to all trade from Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law.’ Johansson insists SodaStream provides employment for hundreds of West Bank Palestinians along with Israeli Jews. She said: ‘It supports neighbours working alongside each other, receiving equal pay, equal benefits and equal rights.’","Scarlett Johansson admitted to Mail on Sunday she hankers after wealth .

"By . Alisdair Glennie . Nearly half a million people avoided buying a television licence last year because of a loophole created by the BBC iPlayer. Viewers who use the service to watch catch-up programmes online for free can escape the £145.50 annual charge by declaring they do not own a television set or see live shows. Last year, 463,846 opted out in this way, a rise of more than 35,000 in 12 months. Last year, 463,846 opted out of paying the licence fee by saying they only use iPlayer to watch television. The figure was up 35,000 in just 12 months . It means the BBC has 1.9million residential and business addresses registered on a database of those who are exempt from paying the licence fee. The figures, obtained under a Freedom of Information request, have sparked fears that the Corporation is struggling to adapt to the internet age. It has led to calls for an overhaul in the way it is funded. Last night, Tory MP Philip Davies, who sits on the Commons culture, media and sport committee, said the growth of the iPlayer and rising numbers of people avoiding the annual fee prove the TV licence system is ‘increasingly unenforceable’. Viewers who feel they are not obliged to pay the BBC fee can fill out a ‘no licence needed’ form. It means they are added to the database of exempt households and will stop receiving threatening letters from TV Licensing inspectors for two years. The number of people filling out the form has risen steadily, from 425,590 in 2011 to 428,359 in 2012, and 463,846 last year. It is believed many of them are younger . viewers who no longer feel the need to buy television sets or watch TV . as it is broadcast. Instead, they can legally avoid paying by catching . up with their favourite shows on their computers, tablets or . smartphones. The BBC now has 1.9million residential and business addresses registered on a database of those who are exempt from paying the £145.50 licence fee . Last night, Tory MP Rob  Wilson told the Daily Mail: ‘These figures demonstrate exactly why the current licence fee model is out of date. 'It operates a 20th century model and it won’t last long with the rapid technological advances of the 21st century. ‘The BBC needs to come to the table with radical ideas about how to structure the Corporation for the many challenges it now faces.’ The BBC itself has encouraged the migration of younger viewers to online viewing. Director general Tony Hall recently announced plans to scrap its youth channel BBC3 and put all of its content on iPlayer only. A TV Licensing spokesman said: ‘There have only been small fluctuations in the number of residential addresses that don’t need a licence in the last four years. ‘The number of households only watching catch-up TV is well under 2 per cent.’ The TV licence fee could be scrapped and replaced with an increase in council tax or utility bills under a radical plan to be looked at by MPs. John Whittingdale, Tory chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said there is a ‘strong case’ for updating the charge. ‘One simple way is to maintain it as a charge to every household but attach it to an existing bill, be it council tax or some other. ‘It’s something that we would consider as a potential alternative,’ he told  the Times. Possible changes to the fee are being floated as the committee conducts an inquiry into the future of the corporation. Ministers are coming under pressure to reassure poor families who struggle to pay the fee that they will not face large fines for non-payment, despite a four-fold increase in the maximum penalty, which now stands at £4,000. The licence fee was introduced in 1946 and cost £2 per year for the single-channel black and white BBC service. Households now pay annual fees of £145.50 for colour and £49 for black and white licences – raising £3.6billion a year for the corporation. The Government is also committed to holding a review of whether licence fee evasion should become a civil, rather than criminal, offence. MPs have argued that high fines and even jail  are ‘disproportionate’.","Viewers escape annual charge by saying they do not watch live shows .

"Police are concerned the easy access to violent online pornography is directly linked to the types of sexual assaults being committed by young men. 'I believe the impact of porn and young men's access to it and the rise in sexual violence are related', NSW Assistant Commissioner Mark Mudoch told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Murdoch also said consumption of these aggressive forms of pornography, which in no way reflect real life, is having an adverse impact and 'influence on respectful relationships'. White Ribbon, a group which works stop violence towards women, told Daily Mail Australia research suggested more young males were searching for violent pornography. There are concerns that young men watching violent forms of pornography are resulting in more aggressive sexual assaults . 'What we understand from research of pornographic sites and porn is that there is an increasing demand for more violent types of pornography', CEO Libby Davies said. She also revealed that research, conducted over the past four years, shows a concerning increase in the 'expectation of young men is that sexual relationships are based on a level of violence.' Mr Murdoch relayed a recent incident where a sexually active teenage couple aged just 16 were completely unaware of the concept on consent. The  boy would apparently have sex with his girlfriend without her consent, but neither party believed this to be a crime. NSW Assistant Commissioner Mark Murdoch warned that behaviours seen in violent porn which may be copied by young men needed to be targeted early with education so young men don't end up being perpetrators of violent sexual crimes . 'I nearly had an argument with the researcher', Mr Murdoch revealed. 'I couldn't believe it.' White Ribbon CEO Libby Davies said more young men are searching for violent porn . 'This is what some people believe is a normal relationship.' Mr Murdoch added that he 'certainly' supports the idea that greater education about pornography is needed to prevent this concerning trend, but pointed out the responsibility does not rely solely on schools to do this. 'There's a big role for the parents in all of this. 'As a community it's a problem that needs to be addressed', Mr Murdoch said. Ms Davies said they are currently trying to educate young people about the perils of social media and some of the things they may be exposed to while online. 'What is sometimes portrayed as normal behaviour is actually abhorrent behaviour', she said. Mr Murdoch agreed that action needed to be taken so that violent behaviours do not develop into more serious ones. 'If it's let go these young men can end up being perpetrators of violent sexual crimes', he warned. Ms Davies also said the danger can lie where what is sometimes portrayed as normal behaviour is actually abhorrent behaviour .","Concerns are growing about young men choosing to access to violent pornography .

"Warren Gatland believes Wales can build with confidence towards the World Cup despite their latest agonising defeat to a southern hemisphere giant. Wales had been on course for a first ever win over South Africa on Springbok soil when they led 30-24 in the dying moments of the second Test in Nelspruit. But their hopes were dashed when an illegal challenge by Scarlets full-back Liam Williams on Boks wing Cornal Hendricks resulted in a penalty try, which Morne Steyn converted to give the home side a 31-30 victory and a 2-0 Test series success. Upbeat: Warren Gatland is happy so far with Wales' build-up to next summer's World Cup . Penalised: Wales lost the game against South Africa after Liam Williams (15) was penalised for an illegal challenge . Having turned in disappointing performances against England and Ireland in the Six Nations, as well as in the first Test in Durban, plenty of questions had been asked of the tourists just 15 months out from next year's global showpiece. But they answered their critics in fine style, with the likes of Gethin Jenkins, tireless skipper Alun-Wyn Jones and Taulupe Faletau producing monumental individual displays. Gatland admits a win against one of South Africa, New Zealand and Australia is needed by his side with the knowledge their World Cup group contains two heavyweights in the Wallabies and hosts England. But the New Zealander felt the second Test performance has highlighted his men can compete with the best in the game. Tireless: Alun Wyn Jones was superb against the Springboks . Powerful: As was Taulupe Faletau . He said: 'Sometimes you play against the best teams in the world and our players that come in haven't always played at the same level of intensity. 'That's why we got caught out last week, particularly in the first half. 'We were also caught out in the first Test in Australia a couple of years ago and in the first Test in New Zealand in 2010 as well. 'But the boys have got comfortable with the pace and intensity and have come out and improved their performances in the second week. 'We have such a small playing base of players. We have got an incredibly tough pool for the World Cup, but we can look forward to it with some confidence. 'We know on the day if we get the bounce of the ball and a couple of things go our way we are good enough to compete with the top teams in the world. 'We are probably a little bit off New Zealand at the moment, but we have demonstrated with South Africa and Australia in the last couple of years it's just a case of getting over the line. 'It's just making sure that you get that elusive victory over a southern hemisphere team and then mentally it just changes that whole focus.' Mauled: Wales battle against the South African pack during the second Test in Nelspruit . Runner runner: Cornal Hendricks (right) of South Africa charges upfield with the ball in hand . The first-Test reverse at Kings Park had led to calls for a number of changes to be made in Nelspruit, but in the end Gatland chose to make only two alterations, bringing in prop Samson Lee and flanker Josh Turnbull for Adam Jones and Aaron Shingler respectively. Captain Alun-Wyn Jones felt the players had justified their coach's loyalty, and hopefully silenced their critics. 'I think there was 77 minutes and 15 seconds on the clock and we were still in the lead,' he said. 'Ultimately we can take a bit of pride out of the week as a whole, not just the performance. 'A lot of negativity, which we try to ignore, gets bounced about with social media. With stuff like that, you are never too far away from home. 'But as a collective we can be proud and, moving forward, this is not the result we would have wanted going into the off season, but definitely the performance.'","Gatland upbeat about World up preparations despite defeat .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- One small slice Monday of Mexican President Felipe Calderon's war on drug cartels: two shootouts on the streets of two cities; a man and a woman ambushed in their car; at least four people dead; three soldiers wounded, one of them gravely. Suspected members of Los Zetas drug cartel are presented to reporters in Mexico City in April. The confrontations between unidentified gunmen and Mexican army and federal police took place in the communities of San Nicolas de los Garza and Escobedo, near the U.S. border in the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon, the state-run Notimex news agency said. One of the firefights lasted 45 minutes. At one point, the suspects launched hand grenades at the soldiers. House-to-house searches took two hours and it would be another seven hours before the areas were secured. According to Notimex and news reports from the newspapers Excelsior, El Porvenir, El Nuevo Leon and El Norte, here's what happened: . Around 6 a.m., a military convoy came across a group armed men in several late-model vehicles in San Nicolas de los Garza. Shooting broke out, and the gunplay continued for 45 minutes along several neighboring streets as the suspects tried to get away. The armed men abandoned their cars, blocked one of the streets with a Suburban truck and fled aboard several other vehicles. The confrontation continued for another two hours as soldiers sealed off a city block and searched house-to-house. ""From early on, we could hear the shots and much shouting,"" Excelsior and El Nuevo Leon quoted an unidentified woman as saying. ""We could hear footsteps on the roofs and soldiers yelling to them. There were several explosions; it seems like grenades went off, because we could hear it very loudly twice."" Around 7:45 a.m., the soldiers entered a house where the gunmen had holed up. A grenade went off upstairs. Three gunmen died there, though officials did not say if it was from bullet wounds or the grenade explosion. At the same time, Mexican military and federal police were involved in a shootout with armed men in Escobedo. That confrontation left three soldiers wounded, with one of them clinging to life Monday afternoon. Also nearby, a man and a woman riding in car were ambushed at an intersection by armed men in several cars who surrounded them and drilled their auto with bullets. The woman died on the scene, her body sprawled on the street. The man was wounded but survived. The violent scene in Nuevo Leon, which borders Texas, has become a near-daily experience in Mexico since Calderon took office in December 2006 and launched a war on drug cartels. More than 11,000 people have been killed during that time -- about 1,000 of them police and other authorities.","Two shootouts in two cities near U.S. border in Mexican state of Nuevo Leon .

"Barcelona, Spain (CNN) -- I came to Mobile World Congress expected to be wowed by lots of shiny new gadgets, but I'm leaving impressed by the seemingly less sexy subject of mobile operating systems. Turns out there's a lot happening here. A lot of the buzz was focused around the Firefox OS launch on Sunday. A rival to Android, iOS and Windows Phone, it seems unlikely it will get much traction in the West. But in places where people have yet to buy a smartphone it might stand a chance -- it's intended to run on less powerful phones that are cheap to make and sell. One of the aspects of the launch that surprised most people was the number of manufacturers and network operators backing the OS. Tell us: What's your dream smartphone feature? That's a sign of how fed up those parties are getting of being told what to do by Apple and Google, and how worried they are that they are being increasingly locked out of the profits of the smartphone sector. They are lashing themselves to Firefox OS in the hope that it will lead to more money for them down the line. Also shown off for the first time was Tizen, Samsung and Intel's alternative to Android. Due later this year, Tizen has had a long history of false starts, so we were excited to take a look at it. It essentially looks a lot like Android, but seemed pretty janky to us and a long way from being ready for release to consumers. It wasn't the best of debuts for something so important.

"Juan Cuadrado gave a glimpse of why Chelsea are desperate to sign him during Fiorentina's 3-1 Italian Cup win over Atlanata on Wednesday. Chelsea have had a £20.6million bid rejected for the winger, with Fiorentina insisting they will not accept bids below the £26.8m release clause in the Colombian's contract. The clubs are expected to hold further discussions over the next 24 hours. Juan Cuadrado scored a penalty to make it 2-0 to Fiorentina in their victory over Atalanta on Wednesday . Cuadrado celebrates his goal as Fiorentina cruised to a 3-1 win to book a last-eight tie against Roma . Cuadrado holds off Atalanta defender Lionel Scaloni as he looks to get a cross in . And Cuadrado proved why Jose Mourinho wants to bring him to Stamford Bridge by stepping up and slotting home a penalty in the 12th minute of a comfortable win for Fiorentina. Fiorentina boss Vincenzo Montella, however, said denied that Cuadrado would leave: 'To date, there is no chance that Cuadrado leaves Fiorentina. He knows that some things are exaggerated.' Montella's side were 3-0 up inside 30 minutes with striker Mario Gomez netting twice. Gomez, who has been struggling with injury and form, had only scored once in the previous 10 months. But he got Fiorentina off to the perfect start with a deflected shot in the sixth minute. Mario Gomez scored two goals during the game - ending a barren run for the striker . Gomez (second left) celebrates his first goal with his Fiorentina team-mates . Cuadrado doubled Fiorentina's lead from the spot six minutes later after Guglielmo Stendardo was harshly adjudged to have fouled Gomez, sparking fierce Atalanta protests. Gomez added Fiorentina's third in the 28th minute before Rolando Bianchi scored a consolation goal just before half time with a curler into the bottom right corner. Fiorentina defender Marcos Alonso was sent off in the 84th after two bookings in three minutes. Fioretina will now face Roma in the quarter-final after Rudi Garcia's side beat Empoli 2-1 on Tuesday.","Chelsea have had £20.6million bid rejected for the Colombian winger .

"(CNN) -- Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy on Monday condemned a deadly attack hours earlier against soldiers at an army checkpoint at the Rafah border crossing in Sinai, vowing ""to capture those who conducted this traitorous attack on our sons."" At least 15 Egyptian soldiers were killed and nine others wounded Sunday when masked assailants carried out the attack as the men were breaking their Ramadan fast at sunset, officials said. The Israel Defense Forces blamed terrorists associated with the Global Jihad group for the violence. ""Terrorists in the Sinai region captured an Egyptian military post ... killed over 10 Egyptian soldiers and took over two armored personnel carriers,"" IDF said in a statement. One of the carriers exploded at the border, while the other was attacked as it was entering Israeli territory, it said. A gunbattle between the attackers and armed forces ensued, and the Rafah border crossing has been closed indefinitely, North Sinai security official Ahmed Bakr said. More military forces have been deployed to assist. ""Our forces will impose a full control on these areas,"" Morsy said in an address to the nation. ""Sinai is safe and fully under control -- those who did this will pay a high price."" Morsy called on the military council to hold an emergency meeting, state TV in Egypt reported. Hamas condemned the attack, calling it an ""ugly crime."" Hamas officials closed all border tunnels connecting Gaza with Egypt in the wake of the attack, according to Tahir Al-Nono, a spokesman for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza.

"A father of four, who applied for a one-way-ticket to live on Mars, could be looking at a divorce as a result of his extraterrestrial ambition. Ken Sullivan made it the next stage of the Mars One project, which could potentially see him making a new life on Mars – but his wife and children are not happy about the news. Mr Sullivan, who lives in Utah, is among the 1,058 applicants selected so far who could colonise the red planet and never return to their families and friends on Earth. Ken Sullivan made it the next stage of the Mars One project, which could potentially see him making a new life on Mars, but his wife and children are not happy about the news. He is pictured  with his family (left to right: Kaitlyn 12, Kaunner 3 and Tana 6 months. His oldest daughter Jocelyn 13, is not pictured . While the 38-year-old might be excited about his potential ticket to an extraterrestrial life, his wife of five-and-a-half years, Becky, is contemplating getting a divorce. ‘The question is do we get divorced now or get divorced later. If I stand in the way of his dreams and passions, then we get divorced now, so I have to be supportive,’ she told The Salt Lake Tribune. If he did make the final cut to live on Mars, Mr Sullivan would also have to leave behind his four children, who range in age from just six months to 13-years-old. His 12-year-old daughter Kaitlyn is upset at the idea she might never see her father in person again and said that she would miss him, yet her older sister Jocelyn told the newspaper: ‘If he wants to go to Mars, he should go to Mars.’ Colony: The mission will aim to set up a permanent manned outpost on the Red Planet which could later expand and the first 24 participants will die on Mars . The Mars One project needs to raise $400,000 (£245,000) by 25 January to fund its plans. Once enough funding has been raised, the Dutch firm plans to launch a supply mission to land on Mars as soon as October 2016. A ‘settlement rover’ will then land in 2018. The landing systems will be tested eight times before they are used to transport humans - a move that Mars One said will make the trips ‘much safer than moon missions’. The group said it aims to have a human settlement on Mars within a decade. Journey time to Mars, which is approximately 40 million miles away depending on its position in orbit, would be around 200 days. The £4bn project, founded in 2010 by engineer Bas Lansdorp, is set to recoup its costs by selling the broadcasting rights to the mission - by comparison, Nasa's rover Curiosity cost £1.8 billion. The older children have already had a long-distance relationship with their father who worked as a contractor in Iraq fixing helicopters. The first Mars One mission is set for 2024, by which time his older children will have grown up, but his younger daughters will still need their father. Mr Sullivan hopes that the mission is delayed so that his youngest daughter Tana will be around 18-years-old. ‘I just hope the family will be able to forgive me down the road,’ he said. ‘Hopefully there isn’t too much hatred of my being selfish in pursuing a dream that isn’t theirs.’ There . is only a slim chance of Mr Sullivan being selected to live on Mars, as . just 24 people will be chosen, but his wife is sad that he did not ask . her opinion before completing the application form and said that she . could not contemplate leaving her children. However, . Mr Sullivan says he loves his family more than Mars, but also wants to . be the first to live on the Red Planet and make a name for himself. He . admits that he will be relieved if he is not selected as he will not . have to make the difficult decision, but also said he will be . disappointed if he is not among the chosen 24.

"New York (CNN) -- A blind man and his black Lab service dog fell onto subway tracks and escaped injury Tuesday after an alert Metropolitan Transportation Authority employee instructed them to duck ahead of an oncoming train. The incident happened around 9:30 a.m. at the 125th Street station in Harlem, according to Marisa Baldeo, spokeswoman for the MTA. The blind man, identified by CNN affiliate NY1 as Cecil Williams, was walking on the subway platform with his service dog when witnesses describe him slipping and falling onto the tracks. ""I heard a man say 'Oh no!,' and I heard him fall into the train tracks,"" witness Danya Guiterez told CNN affiliate WPIX. ""I was in shock and everyone ran towards him, but no one went in the train tracks."" A nearby MTA employee, described by Baldeo as a construction flagger, jumped into action and tried to calm the man. The MTA employee instructed Williams to lie still between the subway rails and not try and climb out as a northbound ""A"" train quickly approached the station, according to Baldeo. Customers standing on the platform attempted to alert the conductor, according to a statement from the MTA. The conductor applied the brakes when he noticed Williams on the tracks, but the train came to a stop only after one and a half cars went over the man and his dog. Firefighters Ralph Costello, George Gerrish and Spencer Presume arrived on scene and noticed Williams was underneath the second subway car but not pinned. They jumped onto the tracks and removed him by a backboard. They said the man was just semicoherent and only managed to give his name and ask about his service dog, which was also safe and uninjured. He said little else, according to a Fire Department of New York press release. ""It's a miracle,"" Williams' girlfriend, who only wished to only give her first name, Cynthia, told CNN affiliate NY. Cynthia told NY1 that Williams fainted and fell over into the tracks but was expected to be fine. ""He's doing great,"" Cynthia said. ""He's on observation. I'm very grateful to God."" Cynthia added that Williams' dog, who she identified as 10-year-old Orlando, was OK and going home with her.","A blind man and his dog falls onto the tracks in a Harlem subway station .

"Hong Kong (CNN)Assailants hurled Molotov cocktails at the headquarters of one of Hong Kong's largest media companies, Next Media and at the residence of its founder and former chairman, media tycoon Jimmy Lai in the early hours on Monday morning. Security footage from Lai's residence show a private vehicle pull up outside his house at 1:30 a.m. In the footage, a masked man emerges from the car seconds after, ignites an object and hurls it at the front gates before driving away. Minutes later, similar devices were thrown at Next Media's headquarters in another part of the city. Police told CNN that both cases are currently undergoing investigation, and no arrests have been made. Two vehicles suspected to have been used in the attacks were found torched, with license plates removed, reported the South China Morning Post. Lai's assistant said that this was not the first time the media mogul's private residences had been targeted. ""We're not shocked. Unfortunately, violence has become a regular feature of Hong Kong now in the political discourse. That's just a simple fact,"" Mark Simon, Lai's assistant, told CNN. Next Media and its founder, who retains a majority -- 73% -- stake in the company, are known to be critical of the Hong Kong and Chinese governments, and have been targeted in several attacks. In 2013, a stolen car crashed into the front gates of Lai's residence, and a machete and an ax were left in his driveway. A week after the attack, two masked men set fire to bundles of the Apple Daily newspaper, a Next Media publication, in an intercepted delivery van, according to the Guardian, a British newspaper. For several days in mid-October, a group of protestors blocked the entrance of a printing plant that published Apple Daily, in attempt to prevent the pro-democracy newspaper from reaching newsstands. Lai, a fervent China critic and staunch supporter of the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests, resigned as chairman of Next Media shortly after the protests sites were cleared in December.","A Hong Kong media HQ and the residence of its founder, tycoon Jimmy Lai Chee-ying were attacked Monday morning .

"Wiltshire chief constable Patrick Geenty is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission over the way his force handled allegations of sexual abuse . A chief constable is being investigated by the police watchdog over the way his force handled allegations of sexual abuse, it emerged today. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating Wiltshire Police chief constable Patrick Geenty, as well as an inspector and detective constable from the force, which last week was criticised for letting sex offenders off if they apologised to their victims. It is alleged they witheld information from complainants about the extent of the force's failings in dealing with the sexual abuse claims. The IPCC investigation relates to the way the force dealt with complaints about a sexual abuse investigation in 2008-20010. Police and Crime Commissioner for Wiltshire and Swindon, Angus Macpherson, confirmed the matter was referred to the IPCC after he was sent a letter of complaint. He said: 'This letter was with regard to the way in which a previous complaint had been dealt with by the force between 2008-10. 'That complaint was in relation to the way a case of historic sexual abuse had been managed. 'Following an initial meeting with IPCC investigators, my office is now in consultation with the IPCC on the matter.' He added: 'Deputy Chief Constable Mike Veale has made referrals to the IPCC in relation to the conduct of two other officers who were also involved in the handling of the 2008 complaint.' It is also alleged that Mr Geenty, who was then assistant chief constable, also withheld information and misled the complainants. Sarah Green, IPCC deputy chairman, added: 'It is vital that the public are confident that police forces will take their complaints seriously and act with honesty and integrity. 'Our investigation will seek to establish whether information was knowingly withheld and whether these complainants were knowingly and dishonestly misled.' Mr Geenty, a former secondary school teacher who joined the police service in 1982, said: 'I am shocked by the allegation that I attempted to mislead a complainant. 'I welcome an open and transparent investigation and the public deserve no less.' Last week Wiltshire Police was criticised by victims charities for failing to send a clear message to sex offenders after it emerged that rapists and child abusers were being allowed to walk free if they apologised to their victims. Police headquarters: Last week Wiltshire Police was criticised for letting sex offenders off if they said sorry . New figures showed that some criminals accused of sexual offences, including rapists, were being handed community resolution orders rather than custodial sentences.

Whether it was jealousy or nervousness, this bird of prey's antics almost ruined the big day for a bride and groom. Lilo the Barn owl was supposed to be flying the rings down the aisle for Ceire and Andrew Bode but he decided to head for the rafters and refused to come down. Mr Bode, 32, tried to coax Lilo down with a piece of chicken but he remained on his perch and it was only when his handler produced a dead chick that they managed to get him down. Wedding chaos: Lilo the Barn Owl (pictured) was supposed to fly Cerie and Andrew Bode's rings to the altar - but instead flew into the roof . The couple, who got married in Hoghton, Lancashire, said Lilo’s performance helped calm their nerves and made sure the day was even more memorable. Flown off: Lilo the Barn owl sits on a rafter holding onto the rings and refuses to come down - despite efforts to tempt it with chicken . Ceire, 33, said: 'It was absolutely hilarious. We wanted our wedding to be something different and this made sure it was. 'If we’d just had the owl delivering the rings then our guests would have talked about it for maybe five minutes. 'Because of what happened, people are still talking about it now. It really broke the ice and stopped everyone feeling nervous.' Andrew, who hired Lilo for £150 from a bird sanctuary, said: 'Ceire is a big Harry Potter fan and she wanted to incorporate this into the wedding day. 'We’ve also been to hundreds of weddings in the past through work so we wanted one with a difference. 'The owl was at the back of the church with one of the people from the sanctuary. 'None of the guests knew we had an owl as ringbearer so it was a surprise for them when, after we’d said our vows, I picked up a glove and a piece of chicken. 'I’d been told to make a clicking sound with my mouth to call the owl over, but it wasn’t coming. 'Eventually it started flying up the aisle, but then it veered off and almost flew in Ceire’s face. Then it just flew up into the beams and stayed up there for about five minutes - only it felt a lot longer. 'But we didn’t know how to get the bird down and the guy from the sanctuary pulled out a dead chick to coax it down. Wedding chaos: The couple, who hired the owl as ringbearer, were relieved when the owl was eventually be tempted down from the rafter . 'It was a bit of a surreal moment really, I didn’t expect to be holding a piece of chicken and trying to lure an owl down from the roof with a dead chick on my wedding day. 'The guests were all really laughing. And it did stop me from feeling so nervous.' Ceire added: 'I didn’t mind at all. It was still the best day of my life. Everything else went to plan, this was just a little hiccup in my perfect day.' The couple, who have been together for seven years, have taken a long weekend to the Lake District for their honeymoon. In September this year another owl held up a wedding after it flew to the roof of a church and fell asleep on a ledge. On that occasion the owl could not be coaxed down and so Sonia Cadman, 46, and Andrew Mettle, 49, had to get married using a back up set of rings. It remained perched high inside the 900 year-old Holy Cross Church in Sherston, Wiltshire, for an hour after falling asleep.

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich extended their dream start to the Bundesliga campaign with a 3-0 thumping of Felix Magath's Wolfsburg Tuesday to make it five wins from five. Mario Mandzukic scored twice after Bastian Schweinsteiger's opener to secure an easy win for the Bavarian giants in the Allianz Arena. They have gone two points clear at the top after Eintracht Frankfurt were held 3-3 at home by two-time defending champions Borussia Dortmund. Schweinsteiger struck the post with a pair of efforts before giving Bayern a 24th minute lead. Mandzukic doubled the lead with a header in the 57th minute and rounded off the scoring eight minutes later with the fifth of the league season for the Croatian star. Dortmund were two up after goals from Lukasz Piszczek and Marco Reus inside the half hour mark on their travels. But second-placed Frankfurt pulled level with two goals inside two second half minutes from Stefan Aigner and Takashi Inui. Dortmund substitute Mario Goetze looked to have won it when he stabbed home for their third but Anderson salvaged a point for the home side after 73 minutes. In other matches, Schalke beat Mainz 3-0 with Jefferson Farfan opening the scoring from the spot and new boys Fortuna Dusseldorf continued their unbeaten start with a 2-0 win at Greuther Fuerth. In Italy, Serie A leaders Juventus dropped their first points of the season in a goalless draw at Fiorentina.","Bayern Munich go two points clear in Bundesliga .

Elegant in a floor-length burgundy dress, her blond locks swept off her face into a chic chignon, Princess Charlene of Monaco looked every inch the royal style icon at the opening of an exhibition on Saturday night. But the South African born royal wasn't the only princess to draw the eye at the Michener Art Museum in Philadelphia, where a new Grace Kelly retrospective opens to the public on Monday. As she toured the exhibition on the arm of her husband, Prince Albert of Monaco, the princess appeared mesmerised by the photographs and artifacts documenting the life of her late mother-in-law.

New generation: Prince Ranier and Princess Grace in 1956, and their son Albert with wife Princess Charlene . And it seems she wasn't the only one, as Prince Albert, who opened the exhibition, also found time to appear in a filmed tribute to his mother which will be shown alongside the rest of the collection. 'I'm deeply touched by your interest in my mother and her rich legacy,' he says in the film. 'Most of the world knows my mother first as a Hollywood film actress, then as the princess of Monaco. 'She was indeed a beautiful and talented woman and a fashion icon but that is just the surface of her life.' Kelly's only son also spoke of his mother's warm parenting style and revealed that he admired her passion for helping underprivileged children and up-and-coming creative talents.

After graduation and a stint on Broadway, she was signed by MGM studios in Los Angeles and appeared in a string of films including Mogambo and The Country Girl, before retiring from acting at the age of 26 following her marriage to Prince Ranier of Monaco. The marriage produced three children, Princesses Caroline and Stéphanie and the current ruler of Monaco, Prince Albert.

"She always liked to play shops when she was younger. Now schoolgirl Angel Thomas is playing the game for real - after opening her own boutique at the age of 11. The mini-entrepreneur has become Britain’s youngest shopkeeper with a business selling pet clothes and accessories. Angel Thomas is the country's youngest shopkeeper - running a pet clothing store in Liverpool . The 11-year-old balances her schoolwork with managing accounts, logging sales and promoting the site online . She runs a city centre store and balances school work with managing the accounts, processing sales and promoting her enterprise on the internet. She has just taught herself to sew and knit so she can create her own range of designer doggy fashions. ‘I’ve always wanted to be successful and run my own business,’ she said yesterday. ‘I love being my own boss and I really enjoy going to work.’ Angel has just taught herself how to sew so she can start making her own range of products . The schoolgirl recently gave her mother a prestigious 'employee of the month' award . The extraordinary enthusiasm Angel applies to her trade has produced steady sales since Pawabella opened its doors two months ago in Gostins Arcade, a collection of independent shops in a small mall in the heart of Liverpool. Every evening she rushes home from school to update her Twitter, Pinterest and Facebook accounts, checks the store’s website for orders that need to be processed and answers enquiries from customers. All her free time, holidays and weekends are spent running the shop, which she leases in the name of her mother Anita. The schoolgirl convinced her to save the money she spent on music lessons for her daughter - and to use it instead as capital for the business venture. This picture shows just some of the products the schoolgirl has on offer at her Liverpool shop . More of the fabulous doggy outfits on sale in the store. The girl doesn't plan on being in retail forever - and wants to study at University to become a vet . In return for starting the Pawabella bank account and helping behind the counter, Angel generously bestowed on her mother an ‘Employee of the Month’ award. Now the Catholic primary school pupil is looking to expand her empire to finance and fulfil her next ambition - going to university to study to become a vet. ‘It’s all I have ever wanted to do,’ she said. ‘Hopefully Pawabella will make enough money to pay for me to study. I don’t feel like I’m giving up my free time or weekends because I enjoy the work so much. My dream now is to build up stock and move into a bigger shop.’ She also plans to expand the empire by advertyising and setting up stalls at dog shows. Yesterday Anita, who has three other children, said: ‘The business is all her. She knows exactly what she wants, and how she wants things to look. I have absolutely no say in any of it - she’s very much in charge. She chooses her own stock, designs her own patterns and even designs and makes a lot of the products herself. Angel puts the final touches to the shop. She wants to build up stock and move shop in the near future . 'She works so hard and is so committed. Everyone is so proud of what she is doing. It’s great to see her really enjoying something she has created herself. She is so full of ideas. 'Her next challenge is making her own personalised dog treats and she wants to start a stall at dog shows. 'Angel has seen her older sister go to university and struggle with money, and she knows that she doesn’t want that for herself when she’s older. She wants to be able to afford to study for her dream. I’m just so proud of her.’","Angel Thomas has business selling pet clothes in the heart of Liverpool .

"A poignant image has emerged from protests over a deadly police shooting in Phoenix, as police Tuesday released the name of the officer who shot and killed an unarmed drug suspect. The 9-year-old daughter of Rumain Brisbon, Aiyana Rains, was among those attending a demonstration Monday in downtown Phoenix as protesters pushed for greater transparency in the investigation. The Arizona Republic reports a police officer in riot gear shook the girl's hand and said 'I'm sorry.' The newspaper also captured an image of the encounter. Encounter: A police officer in riot gear was snapped meeting Aiyana Rains, daughter of Rumain Brisbon, and reportedly told her 'I'm sorry' at the Monday protest . Shooting: Police have said  Rumain Brisbon was unarmed when he was shot by a white officer investigating a tip that Brisbon was doing a drug deal inside an SUV in the parking lot of his apartment complex . When asked about the gesture, the attorney for Brisbon's family, Marci Kratter, said it was 'nice, but it does not bring back her father.' She says, 'It doesn't change things.' Police were investigating complaints of drug dealing in a Phoenix neighborhood when officer Mark Rine shot Brisbon. The officer mistook a pill bottle in the suspect's pocket for a gun as the two scuffled. The move to name Rine came Tuesday just hours before activists and Brisbon's family members planned a protest. Rine, a seven-year veteran of the department, has been reassigned to nonenforcement duty pending the outcome of an internal investigation, police said. 'It has been seven days since the incident and we didn't want to hold off on releasing the name any longer,' Phoenix Police Department spokesman Sgt. Trent Crump told Reuters on Tuesday. 'He's now had time to mitigate any threats he might receive.' Prosecutors will determine whether the 30-year-old officer will face criminal charges in the December 2 shooting. Incident: Brisbon failed to obey the officer's commands and ran to an apartment where a struggle turned deadly, police said, noting that the officer mistook a pill bottle that Brisbon had been clutching in his pocket for the butt of a gun . Police: Officer Mark Rine, seen right next to Phoenix Police Chief Daniel Garcia, has been reassigned to nonenforcement duty pending the outcome of an internal investigation . Police Chief Daniel Garcia told AZCentral.com 'The conclusion I came to is, it's time now. It's time to release the name. One of the things that I've tried to do from the onset of this incident was to be transparent. We're not Ferguson.' 'We're a city who has many communication avenues available to our community,' he also told the news outlet. 'We take pride in the fact that we have a relationship with all segments to our community, and I thought it was important for us to be as transparent as possible from the very onset.' Police have said 34-year-old Brisbon, who was black, was unarmed when he was shot by a white officer investigating a tip that Brisbon was doing a drug deal inside an SUV in the parking lot of his apartment complex. Brisbon failed to obey the officer's commands and ran to an apartment where a struggle turned deadly, police said, noting that the officer mistook a pill bottle that Brisbon had been clutching in his pocket for the butt of a gun. 'Unfortunately because this individual is a police officer and is engaged in the line of work that he is, he and his family are now going to be put under undue stress and concern for their safety,' Phoenix Law Enforcement Association President Joe Clure told ABC15. An autopsy has determined that Brisbon died from gunshot wounds to his torso. The Rev. Jarrett Maupin, a civil rights advocate, said he and friends and family members of Brisbon were planning to rally and march in downtown Phoenix unless police released the name of the officer involved. A call to Maupin on Tuesday from The Associated Press wasn't immediately returned. Daughter: Aiyana Rains is seen crying Monday night during the protest .

Distress: Frances Raftery, 71, said the email she received telling her she was excluded from the NHS protest rally was 'disgusting' A former NHS worker has been excluded from a protest rally to fight the closure of her local casualty unit because she supports UKIP. Frances Raftery, 71, contacted a campaign group to say she would be attending their meeting to help them challenge changes to local NHS services. The widowed grandmother revealed she was a UKIP member, but was left ‘incredibly distressed’ when she received a response  making it clear she would not be welcome at the meeting, being held last night. Karen Reissmann, campaign co-ordinator of Save Bolton Health Services, told Mrs Raftery the group represented ‘multi-cultural’ Britain and was ‘not for scapegoating any part of the community for the problems in the NHS’. Her letter added that they had members ‘across the political spectrum. But concerns have been raised that we do not want to be used by a party that has had no contact in any of our activities in five months we have been in existence’. The controversy is the latest involving claims of discrimination against UKIP members. Last year Rotherham Council was widely criticised for removing three Eastern European children from their foster parents after social services discovered the couple belonged to the anti-EU party. Mrs Raftery, a retired teacher who previously worked in the laundry at the Royal Bolton Hospital where A&E services are under threat, said the response she received was a racist slur against UKIP. ‘I have lived in the same area for most of my life and myself and all of my children and grandchildren have been treated at the hospital at some point during their life,’ she said. ‘I am not racist, regardless of what this group feel about UKIP and I wanted to attend because I am concerned as a local resident. Their response to my courtesy email has been disgusting. ‘If we live in a multi-cultural society then am I not part of that society and should I not be allowed to attend meetings to help protect our local NHS services? ‘Instead I have felt like I have been excluded because of my political beliefs. The fact that I am a UKIP member should not mean my voice is not heard.’ Protest: Mrs Raftery had worked in the laundry at Royal Bolton Hospital where A&E services are under threat . UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: ‘This is another example of the appalling discrimination against UKIP members in the Labour-dominated North of England.’ Deputy leader Paul Nuttall added: ‘The inference in the letter is that we are a racist party, but that is totally untrue. The attitude smacks of the same sort of ill-informed prejudice that led to the Rotherham couple having foster children taken away. ‘The proposed closure of Bolton A&E is a matter that affects local people whatever their political persuasion and it should not be an issue in the protest.’ Bolton West Labour MP Julie Hilling said: ‘It is a great pity when any local protest is politicised in this way. ‘The real issue is the cuts being imposed by the Coalition government. We need all of the community of Bolton to save our much loved and much needed services.’ Miss Reissmann, a former mental health nurse, said: ‘No one has been banned from any group. I passed on concerns that had been raised with me and wanted to let Mrs Raftery know what our group stood for.’ Bolton NHS Foundation Trust, which is trying to save £20million, recently attracted controversy after it stood accused of fiddling figures to mask the numbers of patients dying needlessly.","Frances Raftery, 71, contacted Save Bolton Health Services campaign .

"Washington (CNN) -- Computer technicians have recovered about 22 million Bush administration e-mails that the Bush White House had said were missing, two watchdog groups that sued over the documents announced Monday. The e-mails date from 2003 to 2005, and had been ""mislabeled and effectively lost,"" according to the National Security Archive, a research group based at George Washington University. But Melanie Sloan, executive director of the liberal-leaning Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said it could be years before most of the e-mails are made public. ""The e-mails themselves are not what we're getting,"" Sloan said. Documents related to the handling of e-mail under the Bush administration and subsequent information regarding how White House e-mails are currently archived will be released under a settlement with the Obama administration, which inherited a lawsuit the groups filed in 2007. But the National Archives must sort out which documents are covered by the Freedom of Information Act and which ones fall under the Presidential Records Act, which means they could be withheld for five to 10 years after the Bush administration left office in January, Sloan said. ""The National Archives will sort this out,"" she said. The e-mail controversy dates back to the Bush administration's 2006 firing of the top federal prosecutors in nine cities. After congressional committees demanded the administration produce documents related to the firings, the White House said millions of e-mails might have been lost from its servers. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the National Security Archive sued over the issue in 2007, arguing the Bush administration violated federal laws that require presidential records to be preserved. Court records have shown that the Bush administration knew about the e-mail problems as far back as 2005 and did nothing to fix them, Sloan said. ""They never made an effort to restore them,"" she said. But Scott Stanzel, a former deputy press secretary in the Bush White House, said the group ""has consistently tried to create a spooky conspiracy out of standard IT issues."" ""We always indicated that there is an e-mail archiving system and a disaster recovery system,"" Stanzel said. ""We also indicated that e-mails not properly archived could be found on disaster recovery tapes. There is a big, big difference between something not being properly archived and it being 'lost' or 'missing,' as CREW would say."" Monday's settlement allows for 94 days of e-mail traffic, scattered between January 2003 to April 2005, to be restored from backup tapes. Of those 94 days, 40 were picked by statistical sample; another 21 days were suggested by the White House; and the groups that filed suit picked 33 that seemed ""historically significant,"" from the months before the invasion of Iraq to the period when the firings of U.S. attorneys were being planned. Also requested were several days surrounding the announcement that a criminal investigation was under way into the disclosure of then-CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson's identity. That investigation led to the conviction of White House aide I. Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby on charges of perjury, obstruction of justice and lying to federal agents investigating the leak. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington represented Wilson and her husband, former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson, in a lawsuit over her exposure, which they argued was in retaliation for his accusation that the Bush administration over-hyped the intelligence used to justify the invasion of Iraq. A federal judge dismissed the case on procedural grounds in 2007, but Sloan said the missing e-mails raise the ""strong possibility"" that special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald never received all the documents he requested during the leak investigation.","White House had said that about 22 million Bush administration e-mails were missing .

"By . Joel Christie . The tactical response team that staged a major operation in order to capture mass murder suspect Ron Haskell have praised the sole survivor of the shooting as the reason they were able to arrest him. Cassidy Stay, 15, is believed to have played dead as her mother, father and four siblings were allegedly executed by Hasking at their home in Spring, Texas. She reportedly lost a finger protecting herself from a bullet, which grazed her head, and called police as soon as Haskell left, warning them he was en route to her grandparents house. 'First of all and foremost the 15 year old girl is a hero, by all means,' Harris County Precinct 4 Assistant Chief Mark Herman told KHOU. Stand off: Harris County tactical response corner Ron Haskell using an armored vehicle known as 'The Bear' Haskell had lead police on a 20-minute car chase, with three hours of negotiations then taking place as he sat in his car in this cul-de-sac . Strong: Authorities say it was thr quick-thinking of 15-year-old sole survivor Cassidy Stay that ensured they caught Haskell . Ron Haskell talks on the phone with police as they attempt to persuade him to surrender . The operation was huge and included countless police units. After three hours, Haskell finally surrendered . 'Had she (Cassidy) not verbally articulated to us who he is and where he's going, he would have committed more murders. 'No doubt in my mind.' Following the phone call, Deputies were stationed on Anvil Drive - where Cassidy had said her grandparents live - three minutes before Haskell arrived, looking for his ex-wife, Cassidy's aunt. Following a 20 minute car chase, Haskell was cornered in a cul de sac. A Harris County tactical response team took over with a truck they call 'The bBear', which pinned down Haskell's using another truck, military MRAP (Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected), at the rear.

"Kenner, Louisiana (CNN) -- A ""black rain"" of drilling fluid and a roar of escaping gas erupted from the doomed Deepwater Horizon shortly before the explosion that sank the oil rig, the captain of a nearby ship testified Tuesday. Alwin Landry's supply vessel Damon Bankston was alongside Deepwater Horizon at the time of the blast. Landry said the first sign of trouble was when drilling ""mud"" -- a mixture used to pressurize and lubricate the drills -- began falling onto the stern of his ship. ""We essentially closed the wheelhouse doors. I went to the port side, and I looked out up at the derrick. That's when I see the mud coming out of the top of the derrick,"" Landry told investigators Tuesday. When he radioed the rig's bridge, Landry said, its captain told him there were problems with the well and he should move his ship away. Seconds later, he said, he heard ""the percussion and the slight flash of green"" of an explosion. Deepwater Horizon sank April 22, two days after the explosion. The blast left 11 people aboard the rig presumed dead and uncorked a gusher of oil that has been spewing an estimated 210,000 gallons (5,000 barrels) of crude oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico. Landry's testimony came on the first of two days of hearings by a joint Coast Guard-Interior Department panel. His ship picked up the rig's survivors, and Landry said the rig's captain, Curt Kutcha, told him he had tried to activate a ""kill switch"" that would cut off the well before abandoning the structure. The crew did not know whether it was working when they fled the burning rig, Landry told investigators. The federal Minerals Management Service, the Interior Department agency that oversees offshore oil exploration, inspects drill rigs once a month, MMS inspector Eric Neal told the panel. Test results from the rig's blowout preventer, a massive device meant to cut off the well in an emergency, and drilling mud weights are reviewed as part of that process, he said. Neal inspected the rig April 1 and found no violations, he testified. But he did not inspect the preventer's emergency disconnect system, he said. The companies involved in the drilling process are blaming each other for the disaster. The chairman of well owner BP's American subsidiary, Lamar McKay, told a U.S. Senate committee Tuesday that rig owner/operator Transocean was responsible for the rig's operation and for testing its blowout preventer. But Transocean CEO Steven Newman told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that the well's cementing, or the casing that holds the well in place, must have failed. BP, as the well's owner, was responsible for designing the casing, while oilfield services contractor Halliburton performed the cementing. ""Without a failure of one of those elements, the explosion could not have occurred,"" Newman said. And Halliburton's chief safety and environmental officer, Tim Probert, told the committee that responsibility lay with either Transocean or BP. During the cementing of the well, Halliburton simply followed BP's instructions, he said, and the blowout preventer was Transocean's responsibility.","Alwin Landry's supply vessel was alongside Deepwater Horizon at time of blast .

"(CNN) -- New England Patriots players sang ""Happy Birthday"" to a 6-year-old boy with an inoperable brain tumor Saturday. Daniel Nickerson's visit on the field of Gillette Stadium, where the NFL team was practicing, would be a dream come true for many.Â However, Daniel's biggest birthday wish was much simpler: mail.Â . ""He just loves getting mail, he's always running to the mailbox,"" his aunt, Gail Chamberlin, told CNN. A social media campaign by family and friends brought lots of birthday cards addressed to Daniel to the Foxborough, Massachusetts, post office this past week. It also resulted in the Patriots' invitation to their training camp. Team owner Robert Kraft presented a jersey to Daniel on Friday, his actual birthday. ""Danny"" and the number 6 are on the back of the jersey. Kraft invited the boy back on Saturday to a practice, where he huddled alongside Tom Brady and the rest of the team. The birthday song was ""the highlight of the day,"" his aunt said. Daniel, who was diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma eight months ago, has a tumor that is inoperable because it ""grows like fingers into the brain,"" Chamberlin said.Â ""It was very devastating to the family to find out there really weren't any options."" His latest exam showed that the chemotherapy, which the boy will have every two weeks for the rest of his life, has stabilized the tumor's growth, she said. ""It didn't grow and it didn't shrink, so we were happy about that,"" Chamberlin said. When his family asked Daniel what he wanted for his sixth birthday, he told them he just wanted mail. ""He just wanted news, he loves, loves getting mail, seeing things with his name on it,"" Chamberlin said. The large amount of mail -- which his aunt said was at least 100,000 letters and 8,000 boxes from all over the world -- has ""been a blessing"" and gives Daniel something to look forward to each day, she said. While the family is anxious about what they'll learn about the tumor at Daniel's next doctor's visit Wednesday, Chamberlin said, ""He's running around like an average 6-year-old would do, playing."" ""We are all praying it's stable still,"" she said. ""No one really has lived past a year, we know we are on month eight. But we don't really talk about it and we hope there is going to be a cure."" As for Daniel, ""He knows he has a 'boo boo' and that's really it,"" she said. Strangers help with photo in midst of tragedy .

"By . Sally Lee . Smokey just might be living proof of that common myth: cats have nine lives. But whether or not it's true - he's one damn lucky kitten. So now the six-week-old is safe and sound, with possibly eight more lives to go, after being rescued by paramedics and firefighters at a burning house in Nowra. He's alive! Bomaderry paramedic Kim Saunders cuddled Smokey the kitten following resuscitation with a baby oxygen mask . Emergency services crew worked hard to bring little Smokey back to life when his unconscious body was first discovered under a bed by a firefighter on Friday at after 11pm. The grey fur-ball, who was covered in soot, had suffered from smoke inhalation and required CPR, which was promptly performed by the firefighter. Little Smokey was then taken in by Bombaderry paramedic Kim Sauders who revived the cat inside the ambulance at the scene with a baby's oxygen mask. 'When we first saw Smokey he was covered in black sludge,' she told the Daily Telegraph. 'After 10-15minutes he started meowing again. I pulled off the mask and he pulled it straight back on, it was like he knew — he was enjoying it,' she said. Smokey's owner Marianne Hense wasn't at home at the time but was relieved that her kitten was saved. 'Everything's going to be ok': Within 15 minutes in the ambulance the kitten was purring . 'I don't care about anything inside the house, only that my cats were safe,' she said. Fire crews arrived at the fibro house, on Kalandar Street, and found no other occupants were inside except for Smokey. Ms Saunders, who's been a paramedic for 15 years, said it wasn't the first time she had rescued a pet. It was only two weeks ago that she rescued a Labrador puppy which had been cornered by foxes. In January, she also saved another dog who was running dangerously along the Princes Highway at South Nowra. 'My sister is a former veterinary nurse — she says I missed my calling,' Ms Saunders said.","Unconscious six-week-old kitten found under a bed by a firefighter at burning house .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced the government will ditch plans for the $7 Medicare co-payment. Instead, an optional co-payment will be introduced at the same time the Medicare rebate to GPs is reduced by $5. It will be up to doctors to decide whether their patients make up the difference or bulk bill them. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced he will dump his unpopular Medicare co-payment on visits to the GP . Incentives to bulk bill children under 16, concession card holders, pensioners and veterans will remain in place. The new measures will come into place from July 2015. Mr Abbott said the move came after the government consulted with backbenchers, the public and crossbench senators who raised concerns over the co-payment. He made the announcement, which passes the buck to doctors, with Health Minister Peter Dutton. The government announced plans for the co-payment in the May budget, which would have seen all patients pay $7 upfront when they went to see their GP . Now it is up to doctors whether or not they will charged the optional and reduced $5 co-payment . The prime minister told reporters on Tuesday this change in policy would provide savings of $3.5 billion over the forward estimates compared to the previous one, which would save $3.6 billion. Mr Abbott said the new package had significantly improved the government's co-payment measures, while at the same time maintaining the desired price signal. 'But I do want to stress ... bulk billing stays for young people and for pensioners, and the co-payment is at the option of the doctor,' he said. The government announced plans for the co-payment in the May budget, which would have seen all patients pay $7 upfront when they went to see their GP. It was opposed by Labor, the Greens and crossbenchers in the Senate as well as doctors. Australian Medical Association president Brian Owler has welcomed the policy change but said they would have to take a closer look at the specifics of the partial backflip by the government. 'I'm pleased vulnerable patients are being protected and that's something the AMA argues for,' he told Daily Mail Australia. But Dr Owler did add that the onus had now been put on GPs and the more important issue was the freeze on medicare rebates. He said Tuesday's announcement was a 'mixed bag' but it was a significant improvement on what was originally set out in the budget. The decision to scrap the compulsory co-payment comes as Tony Abbott's popularity hits a new low. Mr Abbott closed out the parliamentary year trailing Opposition Leader Bill Shorten as preferred leader by eight points on 39 per cent compared to 47 per cent, according to a Fairfax-Ipsos poll.","The plan to introduce the co-payment was announced in the May budget .

"Defending champions Exeter made it two wins from as many matches in the LV= Cup after coming from behind to beat Bath 18-6 in front of a record Sandy Park crowd of 11,785. Gavin Henson and his opposite number Gareth Steenson exchanged first-half penalties before the former added a second after the break to give Bath a 6-3 lead. But tries in the final quarter from Carl Rimmer, converted by Steenson, and Moray Low gave the Chiefs back-to-back west country victories to remain top of Pool Four. Gareth Steenson of Exeter Chiefs kicks a last minute penalty during the LV= Cup match against Bath . Despite having one eye on Friday night’s trip to Franklins Gardens to face Aviva Premiership leaders Northampton, Exeter fielded a full strength side and gave a debut to Scotland A international full-back Byron McGuigan. The visitors made six changes from the side that beat London Welsh 47-7 last weekend with lock Dominic Day back from injury, while full-back Luke Arscott was returning to Sandy Park for his first encounter against his former club. Former Wales international Henson got the visitors off to a perfect start with a 15-metre penalty from in front of the posts after two minutes. Henson then saw his long range drop goal charged down by Chiefs’ skipper Dean Mumm. Fly-half Henson looked to have set-up Bath for the opening try midway through the half with a neat grubber kick through but new signing McGuigan was on hand to beat outside centre Matt Banahan to the touchdown. Despite having a number of players away on international duty, it was Bath who were doing all the attacking until the Chiefs came back into the game for the final 10 minutes of the half as they camped out on the Bath line. Carl Rimmer of Exeter Chiefs goes over for the opening try during the LV= Cup match . But the visitors’ defence stood firm and scrum-half Micky Young snatched a loose ball to feed wing Olly Woodbury, who eased the pressure as he kicked the ball into touch deep in the Chiefs half. Five minutes before the break Bath were penalised for not following away at the tackle just outside their own 22 and fly-half Steenson slotted his kick from out wide on the right to level the scores. Bath wasted little time getting back into the game after half-time when wing Richard Lane burst through a slack defence only to be stopped just short of the line. Henson nudged the visitors ahead 13 minutes into the second half with a perfectly struck kick 12 metres inside the Chiefs half and close to the right touchline but saw a second attempt, just inside the opposition half, hit the cross bar. Don Armand of Exeter Chiefs stretches for the line out during the LV= Cup match . On the hour mark Exeter won a penalty for a scrum infringement, after Lane knocked-on, and they kicked to the corner. From the catch and drive replacement prop Rimmer crossed the line and Steenson converted. With less than five minutes to play the Chiefs were again camped out on the Bath line after a steal from flanker Dom Armand. They battered the visitors’ defence until replacement prop Low crossed for his first try for the Chiefs . Steenson’s conversion from outside on the left sailed just past the wrong side of the bear upright but he added a penalty from 22 metres out with the last kick off the game.","Defending champions Exeter make it two wins from two in LV= Cup .

Hoping to help: The hospital's attorney Maria Schimer, who is also a registered nurse, would be granted the right to make Sarah Hershberger's medical decisions if the appeal is granted . An appeals court in Ohio has sided . with a hospital that's seeking to force a 10-year-old Amish girl to . resume chemotherapy after her parents decided to stop the treatments.

The . girl's parents say that the chemotherapy's effects were terrible and . that they're now using 'natural' medicines, such as herbs and vitamins, . and consulting with another doctor. Sarah's . parents brought her to Akron Children's Hospital in Ohio to treat the . tumors on her kidney, neck and chest - a number of which were visible to . the naked eye. Her parents . initially said that she could be treated with the necessary . chemotherapy and she underwent some rounds of the procedure but not . enough to completely eradicate the cancer. But they soon changed their minds, saying that they want to use natural medicine like vitamins and herbs to solve the problem. Akron Children's Hospital has already petitioned once to be granted guardianship of the girl but that initial request was rejected, and now they are re-applying to a different judge . The Medina Gazette reported early . in August that the hospital already applied to take over legal . guardianship of Sarah but were rejected by one Ohio judge who has since . retired. 'The court cannot deprive these parents of their right to make medical decisions for their daughter because there is not a scintilla of evidence showing the parents are unfit,' Judge John Lohn wrote in his decision before retiring earlier this month. He added that the girl's parents were 'caring, attentive, protective and concerned'. It is unclear how long Sarah underwent chemotherapy, but apparently long enough for the visible tumors on her neck and chest to disappear, as court records say that they went away but she did not go into remission. 'Sarah begged her parents to stop the treatments. Anna said she and Andy could not stand to watch what was happening to their daughter,' Judge Lohn wrote. Traditions: Sarah Hershberger (who is not pictured) and her family are Amish, and their beliefs force them to shun technology and in turn, some forms of modern medicine . Sarah apparently complained about feeling sick and she didn't want to become infertile. Nausea, . organ damage and infertility are all common side effects of . chemotherapy, but in this case, doctors say that 'the question of . Sarah's treatment is life and death'. Mrs Hershberger 'prayed for wisdom to discern God's plan for Sarah' and believed that the therapy was killing her. Nurse and attorney Maria Schimer is appealing the decision and hopes to be granted limited guardianship so that she is in charge of making medical decisions for Sarah. 'The plan presented by Sarah’s parents is almost certain to lead to Sarah’s death,' she wrote in a letter to the court. 'Every day that goes by without treatment, Sarah’s chance of surviving her cancer is diminished.' With chemotherapy, her chances of survival increase to 85 per cent.","Sarah Hershberger, 10, has leukemia and doctors say she will die unless she receives chemotherapy .

"Will Sherri Shepherd or Joy Behar be lured back to The View? One of them will, if ABC brass have anything to say about it. MailOnline can disclose that they have approached the former View hosts about the prospect of returning to the faltering show. And Rosie O'Donnell is out of the loop. The View made its fall debut on Sept. 16  to stellar ratings with the new cast of Rosie, Nicolle Wallace, Rosie Perez and returning moderator Whoopi Goldberg. But that excitement soon wore off, as viewers tuned out and ratings plunged below those of the show's last season with Goldberg, Sherri Shepherd, Barbara Walters and Jenny McCarthy. Scroll down for video . Save the day: ABC execs believe Sherri Shepherd or Joy Behar would give ratings a much needed boost . Ready for a fight: Sources says Rosie will be none too pleased if decisions are made behind her back . In a major move, ABC has shifted the show from its entertainment department and moved it to the ABC News division because the network is concerned about the show's direction. Now that ABC News is involved, executives are have been trying to get one of the show's former co-hosts to return in an effort to boost ratings. Rosie hates everything that isn't an idea of hers, but she's not aware of this, say network insiders. Rosie doesn't have the dominance over them that she did with ABC Entertainment. Sources close to ABC News tell MailOnline that the network is interested in either Sherri or Joy returning to the show to bring back former viewers. 'Both Sherri and Joy had huge followings while on the show and their familiarity could be just the thing to spark interest in the show again and generate some positive buzz,' the source explained. MailOnline previously reported that The View was being beaten by the Wendy Williams Show and The Real in the most important 18 to 34 demographic. According to The Hollywood Reporter, The View is pacing downward for the fourth straight season and is 30 percent south of where it was five years ago in that younger demo. Nielsen ratings reveal that the show is only scoring with a much older audience than the 25 to 55 demographic, not something that advertisers respond well too. 'ABC conducted focus groups on the new version of The View and found that the audience hates that the show seems so serious now so there's a charge to get back to the pop culture and social issues that younger viewers can relate to. 'That's why they're talking to Sherri about returning. She brought a fun, energetic spirit to the show and loved talking about the Kardashians and reality TV. 'Despite Rosie's reluctance to discuss that type of stuff, she doesn't have much room to fight it now that the ratings have dropped so badly,' the source explained. Guest gig: ABC News had Behar come on The View to promote her new one woman show off Broadway to see how viewers would respond to her. The feedback was tremendous . Behar has also had some big pop culture moments while on the show, as she famously asked President Barack Obama if he knew who Snooki was during an interview. 'Joy stays abreast of the latest pop culture stories and issues. And she brings a unique perspective to topics, even when she cares less about them,' the source explained, before adding: 'That's how her signature phrase: 'so what? who cares?' came to be.' ABC News had Behar come on The View to promote her new one-woman off-Broadway show - 'Me, My Mouth and I' - to see how viewers would respond to her. The feedback was tremendous. The network is trying to figure out when they can get Sherri to return, but the day they initially wanted her she passed on the opportunity to do an exclusive interview with Robin Roberts on Good Morning America instead. ABC has approached both former co-hosts agents about the possibility of returning in a more permanent capacity, and apparently Shepherd is showing resistance about coming back to the place she called home for seven years. Sherri just signed on to join the cast of TV Land's The Soul Man for 10 episodes.","ABC brass are convinced that Sherri or Joy would bring back fans who have abandoned the show .

The school-wide event May 1 at Queen Creek High School, just outside Phoenix, AZ, was designed to satirize a reality TV show called 'Duck Dynasty,' school officials said, but what started as a way to motivate students to attend the prom ended up outraging minorities around the country, prompting the US Department of Education to open an investigation. Federal investigators will be investigating the extent of the hostilities created in the school by the ill-advised festival. Anger: Queen Creek High School, pictured, has sparked outrage from civil rights leaders after it held a 'Redneck Day' for students . The investigation will look into 'whether a racially hostile environment was created due to language and actions that were not protected by the First Amendment,' a letter from the DOE to the Reverend Jarrett Maupin II, who filed a complaint over the controversial celebration. One student wore a large Confederate flag to school, which he is allowed to do under his First Amendment rights, but was asked to take it off and did, according to the letter. 'The display of the Confederate flag concerns rights protected by the First Amendment,' the letter continued. Seemingly pleased with the impending investigation, Rev. Maupin said the DOE will 'determine the remedy, including moderating conversations between school administrators and civil rights community leaders to shape new policy and racism prevention measures.' Local residents were outraged by the racially insensitive send-up of the hit TV show. Spoof: The school-wide event was designed to satirize a reality TV show called 'Duck Dynasty,' pictured, which follows a family of duck hunters in Louisiana . 'We all know the connotation of . ""redneck,"" Rev. Ozetta Kirby, pastor of Holy Trinity Community AME . Church in nearby Mesa told the newspaper. The day 'really got to' his 16-year-old grandson, Marcus, who attends the school, Rev. Kirby added. Steve Montoya, a prominent civil-rights attorney in Phoenix, said the Confederate flag was the most offensive part. 'The Confederacy represents the horrible . institution of slavery, and that is a direct attack on . African-Americans, Mr. Montoya told the Arizona Republic. The only intent of 'Redneck Day' was to spoof the characters on the reality show, which follows a family of duck hunters in Louisiana, Tom Lindsey, the superintendent of the Queen Creek Unified School District, told the paper. He said the student wearing the Confederate flag wasn't from Arizona and didn't appreciate the reaction the flag would receive. The boy was pulled aside and asked to change his clothes by an assistant principal and the meaning of the flag in Arizona was explained to him. 'We apologize to any people who, because of the word (redneck), were offended,' said Mr. Lindsey.","May's event at Queen Creek High School was designed to satirize a reality TV show called 'Duck Dynasty'

"By . James Chapman . Updated: . 03:20 EST, 16 November 2011 . Berlin declared last night that Europe is speaking German and Britain must be less selfish toward the EU. The UK has a duty to help the eurozone despite being outside the single currency, according to one of Angela Merkel’s closest allies. Even more provocatively, Volker Kauder warned Britain could not block a financial tax that would cost the City billions. Provocative: Volker Kauder (left) - one of Angela Merkel's closest allies - warned Britain could not block a financial tax that would cost the City billions . He insisted it was wrong for London to defend its own interests, adding: ‘Only going after their own benefit, and refusing to contribute, is not the message we’re letting the British get away with.’ He said European nations were speaking German in that they were backing Chancellor Merkel’s diktats. The comments will cause fury among senior Conservatives, who say Germany’s refusal to prop up the euro threatens to drag the UK economy down as well. ‘British people will be horrified by what is going on in Europe,’ said Philip Hollobone, a Eurosceptic Tory MP. ‘Foreign policy going back to the . time of Henry VIII has been to try to prevent conglomeration of power on . the continent of Europe which would be against British national . interests. ‘Here we are in . the 21st century with a German attempt to create a single economic and . political bloc. This is Britain’s golden chance to get out of the . European quagmire and set ourselves free.’ Controversial: David Cameron with Mrs Merkel. The comments will cause fury among senior Conservatives . No signs of abating: The economic turmoil in the eurozone continues to cause deep concern . Meanwhile, the economic turmoil that has gripped Europe shows no sign of going away. The interest rate Italy has to pay to finance its vast debts topped 7 per cent again yesterday – despite a change that saw a technocratic government replace Silvio Berlusconi’s administration. Such payments are seen as unsustainable and have triggered bailouts in Ireland, Portugal and Greece. Spain was unable to borrow the full £3billion it needed from the money markets yesterday and was charged 5 per cent interest for supposedly risk-free, 12-month loans. Attack: Nick Clegg criticised David Cameron's suggestion that the crisis gave the UK an opportunity to take powers from Brussels . The gap between French and German government bond yields reached record levels – revealing fears about Paris’s exposure to debts elsewhere. But Mr Kauder, parliamentary leader of Mrs Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party, insisted EU governments were backing Germany’s push for closer integration of their economies in response to the turmoil. He said there was now widespread support for strict limits on debt levels in eurozone economies, with sanctions applied to any that step out of line. ‘Now, all of a sudden, Europe is speaking German,’ declared Mr Kauder. ‘Not as a language, but in its acceptance of the instruments for which Angela Merkel has fought so hard.’ He said Britain must be less self-centred in its relationship with Europe. ‘The British are not members of the currency union but they are members of Europe and they also have a responsibility for the success of Europe,’ he told the annual congress of Mrs Merkel’s CDU in Leipzig. On the proposed City financial transactions tax, he said: ‘The British don’t  want this and I understand, when 30 per cent of your gross domestic product comes from the financial market business in the City of London.’ The row flared as the pro-EU Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg attacked David Cameron’s suggestion that the crisis gave the UK an opportunity to take powers from Brussels. The Prime Minister used his annual foreign policy speech at the Lord Mayor of London’s banquet on Monday night to insist that the crisis in the eurozone provided an opportunity for the EU be refashioned as a looser union.","‘Only going after their [Britain's] own benefit, and refusing to contribute, is not the message we’re letting the British get away with'

A teenage girl plotted to murder her family using contract killers because they forbid her plans to wed her already married lover. Manpreet Kaur, 19, was arrested along with five contract killers, after the family's servant was murdered in a bungled attempt to assassinate her parents and brother while they slept in their house in Kanjhla, India. The teenager allegedly wanted her family dead after they disapproved of her relationship with Gurmeet Singh, a married man from the Ramdasia sect. Her family snubbed her for wanting to marry him.

"Andy Murray was knocked out of Wimbledon at the quarter-final stage by Grigor Dimitrov on Wednesday as the defending champion succumbed meekly in straight sets. Despite having won two major titles and Olympic gold, Murray has at times been guilty of losing with a whimper at the highest level. Here, Sportsmail looks back at occasions when the Scot has underperformed. French Open 2014 SF – Rafael Nadal beat Andy Murray 6-3, 6-2, 6-1 . Having missed Roland Garros the year before due to a back injury, Murray impressively reached the last four in Paris for a second time. Two tough five-setters earlier in the tournament against Gael Monfils and Philipp Kohlschreiber came back to bite as the Scot ran out of gas against the ‘King of Clay’, winning only 10 points on Nadal’s serve as he was knocked out in one hour and 40 minutes. Making light work of that: Rafael Nadal beat Andy Murray in just an hour and 40 minutes at the French Open . US Open 2013 QF – Stan Wawrinka beat Andy Murray 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 . Coming into a Grand Slam for the first time as a defending champion and with the confidence gained from ending the 77-year wait for a Wimbledon male champion, Murray was highly fancied to claim a second US Open crown. Big-hitting Wawrinka prevailed, though, in two hours and 15 minutes as a frustrated Murray claimed he was mentally exhausted after his SW19 heroics. Problem: Murray couldn't take the strain as he went out to Stanislas Wawrinka at the US Open last year . Australian Open 2011 F – Novak Djokovic beat Andy Murray 6-4, 6-2, 6-3 . Djokovic condemned Murray to his third Grand Slam final defeat as the Serbian stormed to victory on a hot and humid night in Melbourne. A nervy start cost Murray and he failed to find a way back into the match. Murray struggled to deal with the aftermath as he suffered a slump in form, losing his next three tournament openers in straight sets. Theme: Novak Djokovic condemned Murray to his third Grand Slam final defeat at the 2011 Australian Open . French Open 2010 4R – Tomas Berdych beat Andy Murray 6-4, 7-5, 6-3 . Dark clouds gathered over Court Suzanne Lenglen as Murray’s frustrations boiled over in a rain-delayed encounter. Play looked to be done for the day as the match was suspended at 8pm due to rain with Berdych leading 6-4, 3-4, but the weather cleared and the players returned to the court. Murray looked as if he did not want to be there and the Czech took just 50 minutes to wrap up the win. Shock: Murray couldn't control his emotions during a 2010 French Open defeat against Tomas Berdych . US Open 2009 4R – Marin Cilic beat Andy Murray 7-5, 6-2, 6-2 . Murray always reckoned his search for a Grand Slam title would end on the hard courts of Flushing Meadows and rightly so after reaching the final the previous year. However, Murray failed to take two set points in the first set and had no answer to Cilic’s power as the Croatian took charge to seal the upset. It later transpired that Murray had been suffering a wrist injury. Learning curve: Croatian Marin Cilic bounced on mistakes made by Murray at the 2009 US Open .

"Britain remained the greatest magnet for EU migrants and migrants from other non-EU countries – even after other countries opened their doors to workers from Eastern Europe, according to latest official figures yesterday. The UK continued to draw in more than any other country in 2011, when citizens of Poland and fellow eastern nations finally won the right to work in Germany and other wealthy EU nations. The UK accepted 566,044 immigrants, compared to 489,422 who went to Germany, according to Eurostat. The EU statistics arm added that the number coming to this country was twice that who went to France – estimated at just 267,400. The figures cover the first full year of the Coalition, which pledged to reduce net migration to 1990s levels. Net migration is the rise or fall in population after both immigration and emigration have been counted. The promise would mean halving the latest published rates of net migration for the year to June 2013, which show an 182,000 increase. Immigration into Britain hit record highs after 2004, when Poland and seven other Eastern European countries joined the EU. They were given immediate freedom to work in Britain without restrictions by Tony Blair’s government. Only Ireland and Sweden did the same, with the result that more than a million Eastern Europeans came to work in this country while few took jobs in other major EU economies. Germany and others followed Brussels rules and only opened their labour markets to citizens of the Eastern countries seven years after they joined the EU. However, according to Eurostat, although Poles and other Eastern workers did flood into Germany, its immigration totals stayed below those of Britain. ‘The UK reported the largest number of . immigrants in 2011, followed by Germany, Spain, and Italy. These four . member states together accounted for 60.3 per cent of immigrants to EU . states,’ its report said. Migration to Germany went up from 346,200 in 2009 to close to half-a-million two years later. Latest British figures show 503,000 immigrants arrived in the 12 months to June last year. Eurostat also said that Britain gave citizenship to 177,600 immigrants in 2011 – more than any other EU country. Since 2007, the UK has also been the destination of workers escaping the economic crises in Spain, Greece, Portugal and Italy. However, Spain still attracts high numbers from Spanish-speaking Latin America. Passengers arriving at Luton Airport from Romania on the first day since the lifting of travel restrictions .

His comments follow an interview with French magazine Le Figaro that the controversy surrounding his self-imposed exile from France was a 'big misunderstanding.' Depardieu, 64, told the magazine: ''I never left! I refuse to be shut in by borders, that's completely different. 'I am a free man. I feel at home everywhere in Europe. 'This whole story is a big misunderstanding. I love France as much as ever. It's my country.' Yesterday, the actor cooked suckling pig and steaks for his neighbours in Nechin, just one kilometre from the border with France.

A brave springer spaniel is recovering at home after miraculously survivng a 80ft plunge off the edge of a rocky cliff. Lilly bolted off while on a walk with owner Viv Salisbury, crawling under a gap in some railings before plummeting down a steep rock face on the Kent coast at Broadstairs. Still holding on to the leads of her other three spaniels - Ozzie, four, Toby, two, and Milo, one - Ms Salisbury, 49, screamed for her husband Harold Acheson, 54. He ran towards the edge and was confronted with Lilly's lifeless body lying 80ft below. Making his way down the cliff, he feared the worse finding the spaniel lying on her side. But miraculously the stunned pooch survived the accident on April 18 with only a few scratches and bruises. Viv, a cook who walks her dogs daily along the beach said: 'We keep the others on a lead but we usually let her off. 'I yelled, ""Where's Lilly?"" when I realised she'd gone. 'I then noticed a gap in the railings and saw she must have gone through it and over the cliff. 'I thought there is no way she could have survived a fall like that. 'But, thankfully, she is very light and landed on sand. It was scary, we're so pleased she's alright.'

"By . Alex Finnis For Mail Online . Arizona State offensive lineman Edward Sarafin has become the first active Division I college football player to come out as gay . Arizona State offensive lineman Edward Sarafin has become the first active Division I college football player to come out as gay. A fifth-year senior, Sarafin told Phoenix-based Compete, a magazine for gay sports, that he began telling team mates about his sexual orientation last spring. 'It was really personal to me, and it benefited my peace of mind greatly,' he said in the magazine's August issue. The walk-on lineman, who goes by the nickname Chip, follows the precedent set by St. Louis Rams linebacker Michael Sam. Sam told team mates he was gay during his playing days, but did not come out publicly until after finishing his career at Missouri. Arizona State coach Todd Graham said: 'We are a brotherhood that is not defined by cultural and personal differences, but rather an individual's commitment to the Sun Devil Way. 'Chip is a fifth-year senior and a Scholar Baller, a graduate and a masters student. His commitment to service is unmatched and it is clear he is on his way to leading a successful life after his playing career, a goal that I have for every student-athlete. 'Diversity and acceptance are two of the pillars of our programme, and he has full support from his team mates and the coaching staff.' Arizona State athletic director Ray Anderson added: 'The entire athletics department is extremely proud of Chip and is unequivocally supportive of him.' Massachusetts sophomore Derrick Gordon became the first active openly-gay Division I basketball player when he came out in April. Sarafin in his Sun Devils kits. He has yet to play for Arizona State, where he is on the masters programme . Brooklyn Nets forward Jason Collins became the first active openly-gay player in one of the four major U.S. professional sports leagues when he came out to Sports Illustrated in April 2013. He became the first openly-gay player to play in an NBA game after signing with the Nets last season. Numerous other athletes have come out as gay the past couple of years, opening the door for players like Sarafin to do it without so much fear of repercussions from team mates or coaches. The 6-foot-6, 320-pound lineman from Gilbert, Arizona,  graduated with a degree in biomedical engineering last spring and is currently in Arizona State's masters programme. He has yet to play in a game, working as a scout-team player early in his career and providing depth on the Sun Devils' offensive line last season. Sarafin has been involved in research for football-related concussions and has been active in the community with youth sports and the Tillman Scholars programme. He has received support from Michael Sam, who tweeted: 'Congratulations Chip Sarafin for having the courage to be yourself. Wishing you and your teammates much success this season. #courage2014'.

"By . Fiona Macrae . Healthy snack: The cookie, baked for website MuscleFoods, is designed for slimmers who don't want to give up their treats . It could be the tasty way to lose weight. A chocolate chip cookie packed with as much protein as two chicken breasts is being billed as a new weapon in the fight against flab. Designed for slimmers who can’t give up their treats, its high protein content should help slimmers feel fuller for longer. The chocolate chip cookie is also lower in fat, sugar and calories than usual. Despite this, it is claimed taste isn’t compromised – and the fact that they have sold out three times in the past month seems to bear testament to this. Baked in Wales for specialist food website MuscleFood, the biscuits weigh a whopping 77g. Some 40g of this – or more than half of it – is made up of soy, milk and other proteins, following research suggesting that the nutrient is especially good at keeping hunger pangs at bay. Fat is reduced by using cocoa powder rather than milk chocolate and an artificial sweetener helps keep the amount of sugar used to under a teaspoon per cookie. However, they don’t come cheap, at £19.95 for a box of ten – or almost £2 each. Darren Beale, of MuscleFood.com said: ‘We’re a nation of biscuit lovers but we have become far more conscious about what put into our bodies. ‘We were determined to create a product that could stand up to leading High Street brands in terms of taste and texture but with greater nutritional benefits. ‘These cookies will complement hard work in the gym and efforts to shed pounds.’ Frankie Phillips, a spokesman for the British Dietetic Association, agreed that studies have shown protein to be particularly satisfying. However, despite the efforts made, the cookies are still high in fat and calories, with a single cookie containing as many calories as a dieter’s entire lunch. Scroll down for video .

"Jon Corzine has admitted he has no idea where $1.2billion of missing customer’s money has gone since his brokerage firm collapsed. The former chief of MF Global has apologised to customers, employees and investors, saying ‘their plight weighs on my mind every hour’. But politicians and regulators have slammed the former New Jersey governor’s firm for operating as if the recession never happened. Sorry: MF Global's former chief Jon Corzine - pictured today - has apologised to customers, employees and investors, saying 'their plight weighs on my mind' ‘I simply do not know where the money is, or why the accounts have not been reconciled to date,’ he told the House Agriculture Committee. ‘Their plight weighs on my mind every day - every hour,’ the former U.S. senator said in 21 pages of remarks prepared for delivery on Thursday. It is the first time Mr Corzine, 64, has spoken out since MF Global went bankrupt in October due to poor bets on European sovereign debt. He resigned just days later and the . search for the missing customer funds has sent reverberations through . the farm belt and trading floors. 'I simply do not know where the money is, or why the accounts have not been reconciled to date' Jon Corzine . It has also attracted the attention of the FBI and federal prosecutors, with thousands of customers having their money frozen. ‘It appears to me that nobody has learned a thing from what's gone on here,’ said the Committee’s top Democrat, Collin Peterson. ‘Wall Street is operating as if 2008 never happened.’ Bankrupt: Politicians and regulators have slammed the former New Jersey governor's firm for operating as if the recession never happened . A top executive of futures exchange operator CME Group said claimed Global misused hundreds of millions of dollars of customer funds. In the strongest accusation yet against the bankrupt futures brokerage, the CME executive said MF Global moved the money to its own accounts. The biggest U.S. futures exchange operator was a hands-on regulator of MF Global. Its executive chairman Terrence Duffy also gave prepared remarks. ‘Transfers of customer funds for the benefit of the firm constitute serious violations of our rules and of the Commodity Exchange Act,’ he said. He said the brokerage admitted during a call with regulators that customer money was transferred out of segregation to the firm's own accounts. The court-appointed trustee has estimated . the shortfall of customer money at $1.2 billion, but CME has disputed . that figure as being too high. Fallen giant: It is the first time Mr Corzine has spoken out since MF Global went bankrupt in October due to poor bets on European sovereign debt . Mr Duffy indicated the shortfall was roughly half that amount. But neither MF Global nor any of its executives has been charged with wrongdoing. 'It appears to me that nobody has learned a thing from what's gone on here. Wall Street is operating as if 2008 never happened' Collin Peterson . Mr Corzine admitted in testimony that he mistakenly thought ‘investments in short-term European debt securities were prudent’. But he added that his ‘involvement in the firm's clearing, settlement and payment mechanisms and accounting was limited’. ‘I was stunned when I was told on Sunday, October 30, 2011, that MF Global could not account for many hundreds of millions of dollars,’ he said.","Former N.J. governor's firm went bankrupt in October .

"By . Margot Peppers . Hundreds of Shutterfly customers were left bemused after the photo publishing service sent them e-mails congratulating them on being a 'new parent' - even though many were not expecting. The message, which was intended for shoppers who had recently purchased birth announcements on the site, read: 'As a new . parent you're going to find more to love, more to give and more to share - we're here to help you every step of the way.' Recipients who weren't expecting took to Twitter to voice their hilarious reactions to the 'baby news', with one person writing: 'Shutterfly just sent me a ""congratulations on your new arrival"" email. They know something I don't??' What to expect when you're not expecting: Hundreds of Shutterfly customers were left bemused after receiving e-mails congratulating them on being a 'new parent' - even though many were not expecting . Another person who got the e-mail tweeted: 'Shutterfly sends email congratulating me on new baby. I have no recollection of this event. I hope I didn't leave a baby at the hospital.' And yet another joker wrote: 'Congrats to all of those impregnated by @Shutterfly this morning.' Clearly embarrassed by the error, Shutterfly issued an apology shortly thereafter. 'Earlier this morning, we unintentionally sent an e-mail to some of our customers,' it read. 'We deeply apologize for this intrusion and any offense this may have caused. 'Our intention was to email customers who have recently purchased birth announcements with us, and it was sent to a larger distribution in error.' Luckily it seems most customers found humor in the mistake, with only a few - including one who wrote: 'Guess they're trying to tell me my biological clock is ticking' - expressing their annoyance. A similar mistake made by a fertility clinic on Sunday had somewhat more dire consequences. Surprise! Recipients who do not have children took to Twitter to voice their hilarious reactions to the 'news' Lighthearted: It seems most found humor in the mistake, with only a few expressing their annoyance . Shady Grove Fertility, which has locations in Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C., was forced to apologize after sending out a Mother's Day e-mail to a group of patients who were still trying to get pregnant. Unsurprisingly, the women who received the message were none too happy to be reminded that they were not yet mothers. One woman expressed her frustration on Facebook, writing that she was 'very upset' about the error. 'It was bad enough that it was Mother's Day,' she wrote. 'And then I recently had a D&C for a miscarriage on 4-26. Talk about kicking you while you're down.' Reactions: Hundreds of customers were confused and entertained by the accidental e-mail . The clinic sent out an apology explaining that the e-mail was 'intended for patients who have already conceived and graduated from the practice,' and expressing deep regret for any offense caused. 'As you can understand, within this context, the message was very insensitive and hurtful to many,' read the letter. 'We want to personally extend our deepest apologies and assure you that we would never intentionally send a note like this to our patients struggling to conceive.'","Shutterfly has since issued an apology, explaining that the e-mail was intended for shoppers who recently purchased birth announcements .

"When Cara Delevingne, Suki Waterhouse and Jourdan Dunn stomped down the Burberry catwalk in THOSE blanket coats - a new AW14 style staple was born. The wool blanket . ponchos, knitted in muted yellows, reds and blues, patterned with Apache-style zig . zags were monogrammed with the initials of the model who wore it. Designer Christopher Bailey, known for setting trends, explained that Burberry has a long history of capes and blankets and the Burberry Heritage archive revealed that outerwear capes dated all the way back to the late 1880s. It's the blanket brigade! Cara Delevingne leads the finale at Burberry's AW14 show, which proved that the blanket will be the coolest way to wrap up warm this winter . 'The designs were created for activities including shooting, motoring and cycling, and proved popular due to their warmth, protective qualities and ease of wear. 'An illustration for a cotton gabardine cape also featured in Thomas Burberry’s patent application for the lightweight, weatherproof cloth in 1888,' he said. 'The Burberry Heritage archive presents advertisements for scarves as early as the 1880s in the local Hants & Berks Gazette. 'Now, the iconic cashmere scarf, which lands in store on September 2 and can be personalised with initials, is at the heart of our brand, recognised globally and is one of our most popular products over the AW14 period.' Too hot to wear it? No problem! Just throw it over your shoulder a la Burberry's models who brought back the trend from the Burberry Heritage archives, which have evidence of outerwear capes dating back to the late 1880s . High-end versus high-street: Olivia Palermo is lucky enough to have a monogrammed Burberry version, left, but luckily for mere mortals, ASOS have plenty for a fraction of the price, right . And it wasn't just Bailey who sent blanket coats down the catwalk - Chloe, Prabal Gurung, Sacai and DKNY's models all wrapped up warm in theirs on the runway, too. The new poncho styles seemingly take inspiration from the traditional equestrian blanket, with blanket-stitched edging and a warm and hardwearing textured feel. Vogue's catwalk edit describes them as the new 'wrap stars', with Helen Hibbird advising: 'Exquisite fabrics take this trend from sofa to street; look for double-faced cashmere and silk blends for the perfect drape.' Trendsetters: Supermodel Kate Moss, left, and Hart of Dixie star Jaime King, right, love their blankets . The high street is slowly but surely catching on and as the AW14 collections drop in store, the likes of Zara, Asos, Topshop and Net-a-porter are all offering their own cosy versions. Lisa Haynes, fashion and beauty editor of the Press Association, mused: 'When I saw Cara and co. storming the Burberry Prorsum AW14 catwalk, I had instant bespoke blanket envy. The monogramming, showcased by CD (Cara Delevingne) and SW (Suki Waterhouse), gives the piece massive trophy appeal. 'If you can't afford the £895 Burberry price tag, look to the high street for a blanket poncho homage. 'AW14's 'blankoat' blanket/coat fusion is surprisingly handy for transitioning between the seasons. 'Wear instead of an overcoat as a layering staple. If you're wearing a blanket in Burberry's proportions, keep the rest of your outfit streamlined to balance out your silhouette. 'A step on from last winter's shoulder robing, work it like a Burberry model by draping your blankoat over one shoulder. If the asymmetry feels off make like Olivia P and wear around your neck, like a super-sized scarf. 'Any old blanket from the duvet cupboard just won’t do. Your new season blankoat needs to be colour-blocked, textured and luxe - initials optional.' Will you be wrapping up warm this winter? ASOS are offering cosy blankets for £35, left, while designers are such as Michael Kors, right, are jumping on the cosy bandwagon with this £250 plaid offering from Net-a-Porter .","Burberry first unveiled monogrammed blankets at show in February .

"London (CNN) -- UBS to pay $1.5 billion over Libor manipulation, HSBC paid $1.92 billion for failing to stop money laundering, Standard Chartered paid $667 million, ING, $619 million, Credit Suisse, $536 million, ABN AMRO $500 million and the list goes on and on. While the number of fines imposed on banks has remained constant over the past 10 years, the value of fines has grown considerably faster than inflation. One has to ask, therefore: Is this the new norm? Are U.S. regulators using financial penalties as a method of indirect regulations? And will it actually work? American regulators have unique views about how to run a banking industry, views that often differ from their global counterparts. The latter, by and large, have a hands-off approach to an industry that is globally focused. The U.S. has tried, on countless instances, to influence global regulations. But it has been to no avail. The financial services market outside the U.S. is bigger than the domestic market. So, if Europe or Asia decides on its own path, the U.S. has very little power to stop it. It's therefore not unreasonable that the U.S. regulators impose different oversight on foreign banks than domestic equivalents. This is likely the reason we've seen fines of considerably higher value imposed on non-U.S. banks for similar infractions. Read more: Eurozone still has mountain to climb . Sure, some U.S. banks have seen fines in the hundreds of millions: Bank of America, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo come to mind. But the vast majority of U.S.-based fines are small. You would be forgiven for thinking this is discrimination. It's really indirect regulation. If a U.S. bank breaks rules, it is relatively easy for U.S. regulators to march into their offices, take all the material they need for an investigation and then dictate policy for the bank. In the case of a foreign operation, they can't do that. The U.S. authorities have no rights to material held in foreign offices. Further, once funds leave the U.S., they are often irretrievable without political help. This is the reason why global financial services regulations are necessary and inevitable, although decades away. By fining at the billion dollar level, banks wishing to operate within the U.S. will be encouraged to be far more carefully than domestic operations. This is exactly what the U.S. regulators want. Banks find it difficult to operate in the U.S. because they often have to adhere to rules that are diametrically opposed to rules in their home countries. Money laundering is a great example. The U.S. basically asks banks to assume Iranians and Iranian organizations are guilty until proven innocent, while the rest of the world wants banks to assume Iranians are innocent until proven guilty. This means global banks have to operate an infrastructure for U.S. rules and a second infrastructure for the rules of other regulators. The costs are high and the risks are many -- and banks simply don't want to do it. In the end, it's not going to work. The U.S. can fine HSBC or UBS all they want, these two banks are incredibly strong and can easily afford it. But what about troubled banks, or ones like government-owned RBS? If they were to levy the same fines for these banks they could put them out of business. If a bank of RBS's size went under, it could cause economic instability in its home country. The government would have to get involved. And fining them a lesser amount for the same infraction would not go down well with HSBC or UBS who would most certainly send a thousand lawyers to Washington to ask why they were discriminated against. After all, you get a $100 fine for going 20 miles over the speed limit if driving a Ferrari or a Ford. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ralph Silva.","Number of fines imposed on banks has remained constant for a decade, but fines' value has grown faster than inflation .

"A fire that destroyed one building of a Muslim center in Houston is thought to have been set on purpose. Authorities said that someone used an accelerant in the 5am Friday blaze at the Quba Islamic Institute, according to one of the imams's 25-year-old son Ahsan Zahid. Mr Zahid said that an investigator told him that the incident was a suspected arson, and that the fire was not an accident. Scroll down for video . Ahsan Zahid, 25, stands near the wreckage of a building at the Quba Islamic Institute in Houston, Texas on Friday . The fire, which completely destroyed the contents of a storage shed, is thought to have been an arson and may be investigated as a hate crime . Houston Fire Department said it was investigating and could not yet name the cause of the fire. The FBI said Saturday that they are monitoring the situation and could take a more active role in the investigation, according to Reuters. The Council on American Islamic Relations's Texas office has called for possible hate crime motivations to be looked at in the investigation. Federal agencies are expected to become more involved if that is the case. No injuries were reported in the fire, which largely took place in a storage building and is thought to have caused $100,000 in damage. The blaze started at 5am and caused an expected $100,000 worth of damage before firefighters were able to put it out . The Houston Fire Department is still investigating the cause of the fire, though they told Mr Zahid that it did not start by accident . The contents of the building, which housed the institute's computers, lights and equipment for a renovation, were completely destroyed. The center has a place to pray, holds community events, offers Arabic classes and also runs a Sunday School. The Quba Islamic Institute is asking for donations through their website qubahouston.org, and MR Zahid told Daily Mail Online that they had raised $2,500 as of Saturday afternoon. The institute said a man had driven past the institute and mockingly yelled 'Allah' on Thursday. A man with a covered face was chased away from the building earlier in the week. The Muslim center had been scheduled to host a talk by a former Guantanamo Bay guard who converted to Islam after the experience, Terry Holdbrooks, on Friday night. Mr Zahid said that the event took place despite the fire and that 'all programs, activities, and prayers have, and will continue as scheduled'. The institute's Facebook page has also come under attack from posters who have insulted Islam repeatedly on posts where the center is explaining what happened in the fire. The Islamic Institute used its Facebook page to reach out for donations and ask for tolerance in the wake of the fire, but their posts soon saw an influx of anti-Muslim commenters . Two suspicious incidents happened in the week leading up to the fire, including a man with a covered face who had to be chased away from the building . The center's Facebook account responded to abuse on Facebook by thanking offensive users for their perspective . The institute defended itself against the Islamophobic posts by thanking the users for their perspective and urging tolerance. The possible hate crime follows on the death of three Muslim students in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that federal investigators are looking into for motives of religious hatred. Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23; his wife, Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha, 21, and her sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, were buried Thursday. Texas has the US's eighth-largest population of Muslims, according to the Texas State Historical Association .

"Liberal Democrats have triggered fury by vowing to overturn David Cameron’s plans for internet porn filters. Child safety experts and MPs called the move ‘irresponsible’ and warned it would undermine attempts to protect children from hardcore pornography. Lib Dem party president Tim Farron said the Government should enshrine the ‘digital rights of the citizen’ and halt requirement for ‘filters, lists or controls on legal material’. Row: Lib Dem party president Tim Farron said filters blocking porn are 'illiberal' and hamper 'digital rights' Mr Farron said filters were ‘misconceived, ineffective and illiberal’. A motion set to be adopted at the party’s spring conference will say ‘families and individuals should decide how they wish to use them’. He warned ‘essential sites’ on sex education and gay rights were being blocked, while porn was slipping through filters. ‘Our motion is designed to strengthen Lib Dem ministers’ hands in challenging this nonsensical policy, which has yet to be brought before the House of Commons,’ he said. ‘If the Prime Minister really wanted to protect children from inappropriate material, he’d ensure they had access to good sexual health and relationship education.’ John Carr, of the Children’s Charities’ Coalition on Internet Safety, accused Lib Dems of rushing to judgement. Filters are not perfect but they can help busy parents keep some of the most awful stuff away from their children's machines . - John Carr, Childrens Charities Coalition on Internet Safety . He said: ‘When the Lib Dems say they do not want internet service providers to make it easier to use filters, what are they saying to parents? ‘Filters are not perfect but they can help busy parents keep some of the most awful stuff away from their children’s machines.’ Mr Carr said internet providers plan to spend £25million on a public awareness campaign to explain how filters work. Conservative MP Julian Smith said: ‘Tim Farron is clearly putting his Lib Dem leadership ambitions ahead of our children’s protection. ‘Instead of looking ahead to 2015 and pandering to the loony left in his party, he should be . . . prioritising the safety of children online.’ Culture Secretary Maria Miller is in charge of the policy which is under review at the moment . Laura Perrins, of Mothers At Home Matter, said: ‘Online filters are one tool in helping protect families but no one  is pretending that they are  a panacea.’ Helen Goodman, Labour’s media spokesman, said: ‘It’s typically irresponsible of the Liberal Democrats to oppose this protection. ‘It is important our children are protected from 18-rated material. That should not include gay helplines or normal sex education websites but if anything the initial problems strengthen my belief that we need one unified standard and filtering system.’ Labour has pledged to bring in mandatory filters if the coalition’s voluntary approach is found to have failed. The party wants all filters to abide by British Board of Film Classification ratings. A Tory source said: ‘It is bizarre that the Lib Dems have decided protecting children online is no longer important. ‘But luckily the Tories do and a Tory Secretary of State [Culture Secretary Maria Miller] is in charge of this policy.’ Miranda Suit, of Safer Media, which campaigned for a block on online porn, said: ‘Everyone knew there could be teething problems but to ditch the entire policy seems entirely disproportionate.’ A Lib Dem party spokesman said Mr Farron’s intervention ‘is not agreed party policy’. He pointed out Lib Dem Baroness Benjamin had called for tougher controls on porn.","Party president Tim Farron said filters hamper 'digital rights of the citizen'

"(CNN) -- On Monday, a federal court struck down Alabama's medically unnecessary law that singles out doctors who provide abortions and requires them to secure admitting privileges at a local hospital. The court called the justification for the law ""exceedingly weak."" As an obstetrician-gynecologist, I couldn't agree more. This decision is an important win for American women and for the practice of medicine. Let me be clear: We all want women to receive safe medical care. But these laws (a number of states have adopted them) do not make women safer. In fact, they have quite the opposite effect, as they will make it harder for women to access medical care, potentially forcing them to seek abortion services later in their pregnancy. These laws also jeopardize women's safety by forcing qualified physicians to stop providing abortions for reasons having nothing whatsoever to do with medical safety. That is why leading medical groups like the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association oppose them. Whether a physician who provides abortions has hospital admitting privileges is not a reflection on the physician's ability to provide quality abortion care. While hospital privileges in theory should be awarded based on physician competency, they in fact are often denied for reasons unrelated to the physician's medical qualifications. For example, to obtain privileges, hospitals often require physicians to admit a certain number of patients each year. But doctors who provide abortions will likely never admit the minimum number of patients because complications are very, very rare. Here's what is important to remember: Abortion is already extremely safe, and for the vast majority of abortions, hospitals do not need to play a role in the patient's care. Abortion has a more than 99% safety record, with a less than 0.3% risk of complications that could merit hospital treatment. More than 90% of abortions in the United States are performed in outpatient settings and almost all the complications that do arise can be treated on an outpatient basis. It's one of the safest medical procedures performed in the United States today, period. In the exceedingly rare event of a complication, women's health centers have procedures in place to ensure that a woman gets the care she needs. Admitting privileges -- or lack thereof -- don't have any effect on a woman's ability to receive emergency care if she needs it. In our modern care delivery model, emergency room physicians, hospitalists and hospital staff are trained to identify and treat all these types of patient situations. Even procedures with much higher rates of complication and mortality, such as colonoscopy, are not subject to these burdensome requirements because it's clear that they are not needed to keep patients safe. These baseless restrictions serve solely to prevent qualified, competent physicians from providing safe abortion care to women who need it. To put it simply, there is no medical reason to treat abortion providers any differently than other medical professionals. As the Alabama court found, the law would have forced all but two health centers in the entire state to stop providing abortions. A similar law in Mississippi would force the last remaining clinic in the state to shut its doors, leaving women in the state with no place to safely end a pregnancy. Similar requirements have devastated women and families in Texas and threaten to close clinics in Oklahoma, Louisiana and Wisconsin. These laws are clearly not motivated by women's safety, but by making access to safe, legal abortion difficult -- even impossible. Monday's court opinion recognizes that a woman is safest when she can make the decision about abortion with her family in consultation with her doctor, free from political interference. It clears one obstacle in the path of women -- and their doctors -- in Alabama. In states across the nation, legislators who truly care about women's safety would do well to work to eliminate unfounded restrictions to abortion, instead of continuing to introduce them.","John Jennings: Court strikes down Alabama law that erects barriers for abortion doctors .

The private firm that decides whether benefits claimants are fit for work has pulled out of its £500million contract after claiming its staff received death threats. Atos Healthcare, which has been accused of making unfair decisions on when sick and disabled people lose benefits, was ordered to review its tests last summer after a government report found its assessors were of unacceptably poor quality. But yesterday, sources in the French IT company claimed it was pulling out as its staff were increasingly coming under attack while carrying out their work. Protesters hold placards outside Atos's London headquarters in August 2012 . Each month last year they recorded about 160 incidents of the public assaulting or abusing staff, the Financial Times reported. Protests had erupted outside their offices this week, when staff received deaths threats in person and on Facebook  and Twitter. Examples on social networking sites include someone calling staff ‘murdering scumbags’, adding: ‘We won’t be smiling when we come to hang you b******s.’ Another said: ‘Know anyone who works for Atos? Kill them.’ The company has regularly come under fire over the assessments – which are used to gauge eligibility for employment and support allowance and incapacity benefit – amid claims people are being wrongly recommended for work or put through stressful medical interviews. One third of its decisions have been overturned on appeal and the firm has become a lightning rod for Left-wing critics of the Government’s welfare reforms. Atos Healthcare revealed it has been in discussions with officials for ‘several months’ about ending its work capability assessment contract, which was due to run until August 2015. Kate Green, shadow minister for disabled people, said: ¿People have been badly let down by Atos' A spokesman insisted it would not ‘walk away’ from the contract and that it would continue to provide a service until new contractors had been appointed. ‘For several months now we have been endeavouring to agree an early exit from the work capability assessment contract,’ the spokesman said. ‘We will not walk away from a front-line service. Our focus remains on delivering the services we are contracted to provide in a professional and compassionate way until a new service begins.’ However, relations with the Department for Work and Pensions appear to be close to breakdown amid persistent criticism over the quality of Atos’s assessments. Kate Green, shadow minister for disabled people, said: ‘People have been badly let down by Atos. But changing the contract isn’t enough. It’s time for the government to fundamentally reform work capability assessments so disabled people who can work are given support they need to find a job.’ The DWP yesterday refused to comment.","Atos Healthcare staff are increasingly coming under attack, source claims .

A judge in Trumbull County on Thursday sentenced William Brock Sr., of Niles, after he pleaded guilty to 35 child-pornography charges. Prosecutors said evidence found on Brock's computer included videos showing rapes being committed against an 8-year-old girl in nearby Austintown in 2012 by his girlfriend. Bad Santa: William F.

"By . Glen Owen . The family of the former BBC journalist whose imprisonment in Egypt has sparked global outrage made an impassioned plea last night to Tony Blair to use his relationship with the country’s dictator to secure the reporter’s release. Australian Peter Greste, 49, was one of three journalists with broadcaster Al-Jazeera who were jailed for seven years for spreading ‘false news’ helpful to the opposition Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian government, headed by the President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, has ignored worldwide condemnation over the jailings. But last night, sources close to Mr Blair said he was working behind the scenes to secure the journalists’ release. Former BBC journalist Peter Greste pictured in the defendant's cage as he listened to the chilling verdict . The news came after Mr Greste’s brother Andrew asked Mr Blair – who is advising President al-Sisi on the economy – to use his influence. ‘I would like to think that in any meetings Mr Blair has with al-Sisi he raises Peter’s case and does everything he can to help not just Peter and his colleagues but all journalists whose right to free speech has been compromised,’ Andrew told The Mail on Sunday. Mr Greste’s father, Juris, added: ‘Let’s hope that with Blair’s involvement we can make some progress in the right direction.’ Human rights groups have criticised the convictions as a ‘witch-hunt’ to silence journalists in the crisis-ridden country. Mr Blair’s involvement with al-Sisi has proved highly controversial, with even the Labour-supporting Guardian saying: ‘Blair embodies corruption and war... now he’s advising the Egyptian dictatorship, his removal as Middle East peace envoy is a moral and democratic necessity.’ As The Mail on Sunday revealed earlier this year, Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair’s former spin chief, has been to Cairo to advise the Egyptian government on its public image.","Former PM asked to intervene to help get Australian Peter Greste released .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's sexual molestation trial is ""no-go territory"" for defense lawyers in the trial of Dr. Conrad Murray, a judge ruled Monday. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor, however, will allow testimony from two doctors about what the defense contends was Jackson's request for the surgical anesthetic propofol, a drug the coroner ruled played a major role in his death. Defense lawyers appeared frustrated with the rejection of their witnesses, although they declined to speak to reporters about it as they left the downtown Los Angeles courthouse after Monday's hearing. Murray is charged with involuntary manslaughter in the June 25, 2009, death of Jackson, who would have turned 53 Monday. The defense wanted to have a Santa Barbara County, California, detective testify about drugs found at Jackson's Neverland estate during a search related to the sex charge. ""In particular, it is relevant to the defense that Michael Jackson possessed both propofol and Demerol in his residence as early as 2003,"" the defense said in a motion filed Monday. Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney David Walgren argued testimony about drugs Jackson possessed in 2003 ""has absolutely nothing to do with the standard of medical care"" Murray gave Jackson the day he died on June 25, 2009. Bringing up anything about the molestation trial, which ended with Jackson's acquittal, would be ""character assassination on the victim,"" Walgren said. Defense lawyer Ed Chernoff, in a hearing Monday afternoon, assured the judge that he did not intend to question the detective about the sex charge, but only about drugs he found in his search. Murray's defense lawyers want to argue that Jackson was addicted to the painkiller Demerol and was undergoing withdrawal from the drug when he died, Chernoff said. He said he expects the prosecution will say he ""merely liked Demerol"" and was not addicted. Jackson's ""past drug addictions, use desires, possessions"" is relevant, Chernoff said in court. Pastor ruled that the events were too far in the past for this trial and could mislead the jury. ""Anything having to do with the year 2003, any incident with Neverland, Santa Barbara, medical doctors, fundamentally is irrelevant,"" Pastor said. ""It proves absolutely nothing with regard to the year 2009."" Pastor ruled that Beverly Hills dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein could not be called to testify about giving Jackson Demerol shots. Testimony about Jackson's visits to Klein's office in the days before his death could lead the jury ""down the path of prescribing to Dr. Klein some sort of criminal culpability in the death of Mr. Jackson."" However, Klein's medical records can be used in the trial, he ruled. Two of Klein's office employees also cannot be called as witnesses, he ruled. Prosecutors in the trial of Murray, Jackson's last doctor, had asked the judge to exclude or limit the testimony of 26 witnesses Murray's lawyers said they might call. Pastor has indicated he would keep the trial limited to what happened the last several days of Jackson's life. His decisions on the prosecution's request to limit witnesses indicate how tightly the judge will limit the defense arguments. Other witnesses the judge said the defense could not call include John Branca, the lawyer who became executor of Jackson's estate after his death. Nothing about Jackson's finances can be considered, he said. The Los Angeles coroner has ruled that Jackson's death was caused by an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol, combined with other drugs. Prosecutors have accused Murray of having a role in the overdose. Jury selection is scheduled to begin on September 8, with opening statements expected to be heard on September 27. Lawyers estimate the trial will conclude in early November. If convicted on the involuntary manslaughter charge, Murray could face up to four years in prison.","NEW: Defense lawyers appear frustrated, but leave the courthouse in silence .

"(CNN) -- The world's top two players will battle it out for the French Open title on Saturday, but their route to the Roland Garros final could not have been more different. Relief was evident on the face of defending champion and world No. 2 Maria Sharapova who survived a third-set comeback from Victoria Azarenka to nail down a hard-fought 6-1 2-6 6-4 victory. Conversely, Serena Williams, the world No. 1, was so dominant against Sara Errani that the Italian ironically celebrated the only game she won in a match that lasted just 46 minutes and ended 6-0 6-1. Sharapova must now try and arrest her poor record against the American, having won just two of their 15 encounters. Saturday's meeting will be the first time since 1995 that the top two seeds have faced each other in the final. Sharapova, from Russia, had been coasting in the first set but her Belarusian opponent battled back to exert similar dominance over the second. But a delay for rain allowed Sharapova to regroup and when she returned to Court Philippe Chatrier the 26-year-old fought off a late Azarenka charge to book a second successive final. ""I really had to play to the end today and I am extremely happy to be back in the final,"" Sharapova told reporters at a press conference. ""(The rain delay) gave me a little bit of time to think of what I did well in the first set and try to get that back again for the third."" Azarenka agreed the short rain break had stalled her comeback and played into her opponent's hands. ""I think the break kind of changed the momentum, for sure,"" she said. ""When we got back out I kind of didn't start the same way I was playing in the second set. ""I was just trying to make things happen too quick and started missing the ball. You know, it was a little bit unfortunate and inconsistent in that particular moment."" There were no such twists and turns in the other semifinal as Williams punished Errani, the No. 5 seed, right from the first point to reach only her second final in Paris. Williams hit 40 winners while Errani could only manage two. The Italian managed to claim just five points on Williams' serve. ""I told myself: 'Serena, just concentrate' and that's what I did,"" Williams, who beat sister Venus to win the 2002 French Open, said in an on-court interview. ""Against Maria, I will have to prepare slightly differently. She's a great player. But it's magnificent to be back in the final after 11 years."" Errani, a losing finalist to Sharapova last year, was philosophical after her sixth straight defeat to her American opponent. ""I enjoyed it,"" she told reporters. ""It was a great court, great weather. What she did today was unbelievable. She is so strong and is an unbelievable player."" ""It was a great day. I tried but that's sport. Sometimes you lose, but you have to stay in there and try until the last point. I gave it my all, but there was nothing I could do.""","Maria Sharapova will face Serena Williams in the women's French Open final .

Kiya Ingham chased and restrained Bradley Jay Hughes, 31, after he assaulted two WPCs in Brighton . He said: 'I took interest at what was happening inside the police car and sat at the bus stop for about 30 seconds. 'Then the man flipped. I dropped my bag, which had my tablet and phone in, and ran after him. I didn't think, it was just instinct. 'When I was running I was just hoping I could get him down, because if he did that to police officers he could do worse to me. 'You can see him point at me and say 'I know your face'. The officers were speaking to Hughes  as Mr Ingham arrived at the bus stop after arresting him over a domestic incident in June . Hughes lunged at the officers as he forced his way out of their patrol car, with Mr Ingham sitting nearby . A bare-chested Hughes then escaped their grasp and began sprinting away from them . But after Mr Ingham tackled him, WPC Lynsey Burkinshaw and WPC Johanna Clarke were able to hold him down . 'He was being aggressive and swearing at me, but then back-up arrived and he was taken away.' The two policewomen had arrested Hughes over a domestic incident on June 10, but he kicked out after being put into the car and attempted to escape. In the video he is shown shoving them out of the way and wrestling with them on the ground.

"Chibok, Nigeria (CNN) -- It's the beginning of the second semester in public schools across Nigeria and students are flocking back after the vacation. But in most of Borno state, the heartland of the militant group Boko Haram, the desks are empty and the playing fields are quiet. Western education is a sin in the eyes of the terror group --- and nowhere has that message more clearly hit home than in their recent horrific attack on Chibok Girls Secondary School. Only the walls of the classrooms, library and science laboratories remain: a charred shell of what was once, the pride of Chibok. But even more painful is the fact that more than 200 of the girls who took classes here are still missing, kidnapped from the school during that night of terror. Daniel Muvia, a resident of Chibok who witnessed the attack on his village, says he is too scared to take his daughters to school. Since the attack he's kept them at home, where he felt they would be safer. ""I am scared of sending them to school,"" he says. ""I'm not feeling good that they're at home and I'm not feeling good to send them to school because of the attacks."" Muvia's dilemma mirrors that of almost every parent in Chibok: torn between education for their child and their family's safety. On the way to Chibok from Abuja, the country's capital, travelers meet one police or military checkpoint after another. But join the main rough dirt road to Chibok and the government security presence seems to taper off. It all leaves local residents feeling vulnerable and afraid. Muvia couldn't forgive himself if he sent his daughter to school and then heard that something had happened to her. ""No one can afford losing their daughter,"" he says. In an article on his website ""Education for All"" Gordon Brown, the U.N. Special Envoy for Global Education, says 10.5 million children in Nigeria are yet to go to school and that the high levels of illiteracy are now an economic problem, as well as a social disaster, for the country. Analysts say that if the Boko Haram attacks on schools continue unabated then those levels of illiteracy will significantly increase, further compromising the future of the country's young people. CNN interviewed one of the girls who managed to escape from Boko Haram on the night they were taken from their dormitory. Though she hopes to go back to school soon so she can fulfil her dream of becoming a doctor, she's still very scared. ""If in Chibok, I'll never go again,"" she says. But like many families in the area her family is too poor to send her to a boarding school far away from the village. All the people in Chibok seem to have left is hope. Muvia prays a day will come when his daughters will be free to pursue their futures and become lawyers, doctors or engineers. ""When I see all these people doing their jobs, I have the desire -- or the hope -- that I want my children to be like them,"" he says. ""I have very high hopes for them.""","Up to 300 schoolgirls have been kidnapped by Boko Haram from Chibok, Nigeria .

"By . Dan Bloom . Stunned police found 70 guns and a Second World War hand grenade when they made a routine search of a dead man's house. Officers were tipped off by a relative who was clearing out the semi-detached bungalow in Brighton, East Sussex, after 72-year-old owner Barrie Hollington passed away. Thinking they would find 'two or three' weapons, police were astonished to discover 30 rifles and 40 handguns - many of which were live and loaded. Haul: Thinking they would find 'two or three' weapons, police in Brighton were astonished to discover 30 rifles, 40 handguns and a Second World War grenade in a routine search of a dead man's house in suburban Brighton . Overgrown: Police visited this suburban house in Brighton after its owner died, where they found the weapons . A bomb disposal team was called to the overgrown empty home, which is in a leafy street on the outskirts of Brighton lined with semi-detached bungalows. The weapons they found included Second World War Sten gun, a Dirty Harry-style Magnum revolver, rusty bayonets and even a belt-fed automatic machine gun. They made sure the grenade was safe before officers removed the weapons for further investigation. Mr Hollington was believed to have lived in the £220,000 bungalow with his brother Robert Hollington, and neighbours said the house also contained a book collection. Neighbour Alicia Taylor, said: 'I didn't know there were weapons there until someone told me. 'He was a bit of a loner and an oddball. He never did anyone any harm though. 'He was taken into care about a month or so ago.' Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'Who would have thought it, hey? Barrie seemed alright. He was an eccentric but never violent at all. 'It's a nice community round here, the sort of last place you would expect to find one gun, let alone 70.' Clutter: A view through one of the windows of the house, whose owner was described as an avid collector . Mystery: Sussex Police have not revealed any more details about the man, including his age or cause of death . The weapons have now been catalogued . at police headquarters with a green tag attached to each of the guns, . which vary massively in shape, size and heritage. A Sussex Police spokesman said: 'They were reported to us by a relative who was clearing out the house after the man died.' Sergeant Chris Lane added: 'Let’s say it was not our usual day at the office. 'We were told we might found two or three firearms at the house but were amazed to find 70. 'The late owner of them who lived at the house was obviously an avid gun collector. 'The firearms have been removed and secured by officers and enquiries will be made into their origins.' Police are now trying to establish where the guns came from. Leafy: Police were called to this street on the outskirts of Brighton, lined with semi-detached bungalows . Sussex . Police have not revealed whether Mr Hollington had a gun licence, but one of Britain's leading firearms experts said at least some of the collection was probably legal. David . Dyson, who is regularly used as a gun expert in court, said: 'As a principle and looking at the number of . weapons, I would think that many of the guns would have been collected . legally. 'There are a number of weapons from many different decades, but the majority look to be from the Second World War. It would be very difficult for someone to amass a collection of guns that size totally illegally. 'It's very hard to price weapons without handling them, but that collection would be worth thousands of pounds, or maybe more. 'If one of the revolvers is an antique, that could be worth a thousand pounds on its own.' Did you know the gun hoarder?

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . PUBLISHED: . 08:20 EST, 1 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:56 EST, 1 February 2013 . A baby girl nearly died after she was born with a tumour crushing her windpipe. Doctors had to race to save  Isabel Roberts' life by creating an airway so she can breathe. The tumour weighed 0.6lb - a sixth of her 3lb 9oz weight when she was born. Had she not been born by  Caesarean section, she would have been unable to breathe because the tumour was pressing down so hard on her airway. And the pioneering operation she had to remove it is a UK first, doctors say. Isabel was born after her twin sister  Alexandra, who arrived without any problems. Isabel Roberts (left) with mother Maureen and twin sister Alexandra. Isabel was born with a cancerous tumour the size of an orange on her neck, which left her struggling to breathe . But the surgical team from Sheffield Children's Hospital and Sheffield's Jessops maternity hospital were faced with a much more complex situation with Isabel. They had to free her head from the uterus, allowing her to continue getting oxygen from the umbilical cord as they fitted a tube down her constricted throat to enable her to start breathing normally. Dr Ayman Eissa, the consultant . anaesthetist at Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust who found and . secured Isabel's airway during the 'exit procedure', said: 'As soon as . the baby's head was out of the uterus it was a race against time. 'We estimate the placenta will . continue to supply oxygen through the cord for up to five minutes, but . you can never be sure, it could break off at any time. 'The baby was so small and the tumour . so big, it was a very difficult job to secure the airway. The relief . when I secured the tube was unimaginable. It was definitely the most . stressful few minutes of my career.' Isabel's mother Maureen, from Hoyland, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire, said they found out she had an abnormal mass at an ultrasound scan 33 weeks into the pregnancy. She said: 'The few weeks leading . up to and after the twins' arrival were a blur, it's crazy to think . just how much has happened to my baby. I can remember walking into the . operating theatre to have the caesarean and not knowing what was going . to have happened when I woke up.' When doctors weighed the tumour, they found it accounted for a sixth of Isabel's body weight. She is now responding well to treatment . The orange-sized tumour was removed 10 days after the twins was born and specialists believe Isabel has every chance of making a full recovery. The twins, who are now 16 weeks old, are now back home with their parents and older sisters Sarah, 16, and Olivia, 11. Neil Bateman, the consultant ear, nose and throat surgeon, who removed Isabel's tumour said: 'The tumour was sitting right on the trachea and was very close to her major arteries. 'It was tricky to remove, but I managed to get it all. 'When we weighed the tumour it accounted for one sixth of her entire body weight. It is very rare for a baby to develop a tumour of this size in the womb.' Tests showed the tumour was cancerous and Isabel was put on a course of chemotherapy at the Children's Hospital after her birth, which is continuing. Mr Roberts said: 'Isabel looked so much better after Mr Bateman removed the tumour. Her head was not forced back anymore, she looked like a normal baby. 'Then we found out she had cancer, it was unbelievable.' But Dr Anna Jenkins, who is treating Isabel, said she should recover fully. She said: 'It is very rare for a baby to be born with such a large cancerous tumour. 'She is coping well with treatment. The cancer hasn't spread and we are expecting her to make a full recovery.' Mrs Roberts said: 'I was really nervous going home for the first time without the support of the nurses, but it was also such a relief and meant Isabel was getting better and we could be a family. 'We only have to go to the hospital every three weeks for chemotherapy at the moment, and she's getting stronger every day.'","Isabel Roberts born with tumour on neck that weighed a sixth of her weight .

"Black Hawk helicopters and truck-sized X-ray machines that are typically used along the U.S.-Mexico border have been brought to the Super Bow venue to bolster security. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) showcased the technology on Monday in preparation for Sunday’s football game between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. CBP Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske was on hand to detail key features of the agency's Black Hawks and the large mobile X-ray machines used to detect contraband and explosives. The Black Hawk helicopters and truck-sized X-ray machines  have been brought to the Super Bowl venue in Glendale, Arizona to assist with the security effort . A U.S. Customs and Border Protection Black Hawk helicopter flies above University of Phoenix Stadium, site of Super Bowl XLIX football game, which will be on February 1 . The X-ray machines slowly pan outside a semi-truck while operators look for anomalies. They are in heavy use at the Mariposa Port of Entry in Nogales, Arizona, one of the busiest ports of entry for commerce in the country. Within a few minutes, the machines can scan an entire semi-trailer for explosives. Tucson-based helicopters and Black Hawks will monitor the airspace around the game, which will be a no-fly zone while the game is on. The Black Hawks are used by the CBP and the Border Patrol for a variety of missions, including rescuing sick and injured people as they cross the border. The large mobile X-ray machines that are used to detect contraband and explosives are usually deployed at the U.S.-Mexico border . A U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent sits in a control booth as the X-ray machine he is in scans a tractor trailer truck outside of University of Phoenix Stadium, site of the NFL Super Bowl football game . The mighty machines have also recently been used to arrest so-called 'scouts,' or people acting as lookouts for drug and human smuggling organizations. Mr Kerlikowske said Arizona's border with Mexico will still be secure while some equipment is used in Glendale. He also said that the people that operate the technology provided by customs will play a key part in keeping everyone safe at the big game. ‘The real key about this equipment is the people who operate them,’ Mr Kerlikowske said.

"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 12:16 PM on 13th January 2012 . A GP accused of telling a patient he was an 'a*******' destined for a 'horrible death' will battle to save his practice before a tribunal next month. Dr Richard Dunn faces allegations that his 'rude and abrupt manner' left patients feeling bullied and intimidated and, instead of simply telling tobacco addicts their options, he informed them they would die horribly if they didn't quit. However the GP, who practices in West Kent, disputes the accusations and says that, even if he did use the word 'a*******', it was not a description of his patient but was meant as 'a basic description of a part of his anatomy'. A file picture of an unknown GP talking to a patient. Dr Richard Dunn faces claims that his 'rude and abrupt manner' left patients feeling bullied and intimidated . After a series of patient complaints about Dr Dunn's manner, West Kent Primary Care Trust is now trying to have him removed from its 'Performers' List' and the case is set to be heard by the First Tier Tribunal in February. In a preliminary decision last month, tribunal judge, Melanie Lewis, said Dr Dunn stands accused of having a 'grossly unprofessional and unacceptable manner towards patients' as well as poor record keeping and failing to provide 'clinically appropriate' treatment in some cases. The Primary Care Trust (PCT) launched an investigation after a 'significant number' of patients requesting a transfer from Dr Dunn's practice raised concerns about his conduct and the treatment he was providing. Detailing some of the 'highlights' of the claims Dr Dunn faces, Judge Lewis added: 'A number of patients complained of no eye contact and/or rude and abrupt manner. Patients complained of Dr Dunn being bullying and intimidating when they felt too ill to defend themselves. West Kent Primary Care Trust is trying to have Dr Dunn removed from its 'Performers' List' and the case is set to be heard by the First Tier Tribunal . 'There is also a specific example of Dr Dunn allegedly telling a patient that he was an 'a******' and was going to die a 'horrible death' and was a 'burden on him'. 'In relation to that particular allegation, which he (Dr Dunn) does not accept, he says that whilst he may have used that word, it was not a description of the patient but a basic description of a part of his anatomy'. Another patient who complained of 'foul language', claimed Dr Dunn had told him: 'Now get out of my office, you're p****** me off and no doubt you p*** other people off as well'. Judge Lewis added: 'We read other examples of where Dr Dunn hadn't simply given patients an explanation of the choices available to them if they continued to for example smoke, but allegedly told them that they would die a horrible death.' Dr Dunn was temporarily suspended from the PCT's Performers' List in October 2010, but Judge Lewis refused to extend that and he has been back on the list, subject to an agreed regime of 'strict and intensive monitoring and supervision', since the December ruling. In her decision, Judge Lewis said 'no adverse professional findings' had ever been made against Dr Dunn, who qualified in 1986 and is now in his mid-50s. The judge made no findings on any of the allegations faced by Dr Dunn, none of which have been proved, and observed: 'Overall, our view is that whilst troubling, conduct and negative language to patients, are issues that are capable of being remedied.'

"Relevant: Charles Darwin the naturalist who set out the theory of evolution . Darwinian 'survival-of-the-fittest' laws continue to shape human evolution in the modern age, research has found. Humans are subject to the forces of natural selection just like any other species, say scientists. Human customs such as marriage have not slowed the drive of natural selection - and men are evolving traits to increase their mating success, which could include such factors as good looks or even intelligence which might help them achieve success . This is because mating with more partners increases the chance of reproductive success for a man - whereas it doesn't for a woman. A popular misconception is that humans stopped evolving when they took up farming and embraced monogamy. But evidence from detailed church records of almost 6,000 Finns born between 1760 and 1849 suggests this is not so. Researchers looked at economic status, births, deaths and marriages to examine four key natural selection factors. They were survival to adulthood, mate access, mating success and fertility. They found that the Finns' natural selection opportunities were on a par with those seen in the wild. Finland has some of the best . available data for such research thanks to detailed church records of . births, deaths, marriages and wealth status which were kept for tax . purposes. Movement in the country was also very limited until the 20th century. Differences in early survival and fertility were responsible for most of the variation in fitness, even among wealthy individuals. Dr Virpi Lummaa, from the University of . Sheffield's department of animal and plant sciences, said: 'We have . shown advances have not challenged the fact that our species is still . evolving, just like all the other species ""in the wild"". Men are evolving to be more attractive: This is because mating with more partners increases the chance of reproductive success for a man - whereas it doesn't for a woman . Current: Charles Darwin made many of his great discoveries studying animals of the Galapagos Islands . 'It is a common misunderstanding that evolution took place a long time ago, and that to understand ourselves we must look back to the hunter-gatherer days of humans.' Dr Lummaa said evidence had already proved important selection had been taking place in very recent populations. She said: 'Humans continue to be affected by both natural and sexual selection. 'Although the specific pressures, the factors making some individuals able to survive better, or have better success at finding partners and produce more kids, have changed across time and differ in different populations.' The new findings are published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Co-author Dr Alexandre Courtiol, from the Wissenschaftskolleg Institute for Advanced Study in Berlin, Germany, said: 'Characteristics increasing the mating success of men are likely to evolve faster than those increasing the mating success of women. 'This is because mating with more partners was shown to increase reproductive success more in men than in women. 'Surprisingly, however, selection affected wealthy and poor people in the society to the same extent.'","Characteristics changing 'mating success' of men changing faster than those that affect women .

On Sunday night, a South Carolina man was sentenced to death for the kidnapping and murder of an 8-year-old girl. Ricky Lee Blackwell Sr., 55, reportedly choked Heather Brooke Center and shot her four times in front of ex-wife Angela Davis and his grandsons in 2009, The Spartanburg Herald Journal reports.

Blackwell has been sentenced to death for the murder of 8-year-old Heather Brooke Center . Ricky Lee Blackwell, Sr. talks with his attorneys during the sentencing phase on Sunday, March, 16, 2014 . The jury, consisting of five women and seven men, deliberated for more than five hours. Blackwell's execution is set for June 14 but is expected to be delayed as the case is appealed. Solicitor Barry Barnette told jurors that Center's parents would miss multiple memories with their daughter. 'They’ll never see her go on her first date,' he reportedly said during closing arguments. 'They won’t see her go to her first prom. They won’t see her graduate from high school. How much would they pay to have one phone call, to send a piece of mail to her?' Heather Brooke Center, pictured, was killed by Blackwell in 2009 . Center, pictured, was only 8 years old at the time of her death . Barnette also argued that Blackwell is not mentally retarded -- something the defense had claimed. Barnette, the paper reports, said the forensic psychologist who testified was not 'credible.' Two other psychologists did not find Blackwell to be intellectually disabled. Barnette, the paper adds, also said that Blackwell's suicide attempts -- including when he shot himself in the stomach after officers arrived responding to the 2009 shooting -- were grabs for attention.

"MBOLA, Tanzania (CNN)  -- Moved by a 2007 trip to Ghana, singer/songwriter John Legend joined the fight to end extreme poverty in his lifetime. And based on his experiences in poor, rural areas of Africa, he says, real change is possible. John Legend says ""Mama"" Mwadawa Ruziga's role in uplifting her community inspired him. ""I don't want people to only see Africa as a bunch of victims,"" Legend says. ""The people that I've come across in these extremely impoverished villages, they want to work. They want to participate in their own development."" To help people lift themselves out of poverty, Legend founded the Show Me Campaign, named after one of his songs. Partnering with economist Jeffrey Sachs' Millennium Promise organization, Legend's group adopted Mbola, a remote village in Tanzania that has little access to drinking water and improved farming techniques, according to Millennium Promise. ""The folks in Mbola are starting at a supreme disadvantage. Most of them are living on less than a dollar a day,"" Legend says. ""It's difficult for them to even survive."" On his 2007 visit to Mbola, Legend met ""Mama"" Mwadawa Ruziga, a single mother of two who was freeing herself from poverty. Her entrepreneurial spirit impressed Legend and solidified his belief that sustainable development at the community level can work in the fight against poverty. Ruziga leads a local business collective that sells products -- like wine, jam and juice -- that it makes out of indigenous fruits. ""I was really inspired by her willingness to not just wait for a handout, but really take an active role in helping to uplift her community,"" he says. Through the Show Me Campaign, Legend has pledged to raise $1.5 million over five years to support programs similar to Ruziga's that are aimed at alleviating poverty in Mbola. But this is not just about cutting a check, he says. ""You can always go in and bring an influx of money and address things temporarily. But if development's not sustainable, then something's wrong,"" Legend says. ""This is about teaching them how to farm better, improving the education system, getting water pumps. The idea is that [the community] will continue to sustain themselves over time."" Before joining her collective, Ruziga, 47, says her life was at an all-time low. For years, she suffered through malaria and droughts. ""The only thing I did was farming, then I would just sit idle with nothing to do. But after joining the group, my life changed for the better, slowly by slowly,"" Ruziga says. In addition to agricultural processing, Ruziga's group focuses on horticulture and tree planting. Ruziga herself has been instrumental to the success of the group, traveling to trade shows in the Tanzanian cities of Tabora and Dar es Salaam to sell their products. ""Our group has spread to other areas of Tanzania, and we've experienced great success because many people have come to know about us,"" Ruziga says.  Watch Legend talk about meeting Ruziga, and see her group making products » . Six different villages have adopted the group's successful model. ""I think she's a great example of someone who's given the tools to succeed, having the energy, having the follow-through, having the leadership skills to go ahead and do it,"" Legend says. Not only has Ruziga's group changed her own life, but other members' lives have also improved. This is the first time that some of them have ever earned an income. ""Now they are more educated than before,"" Ruziga says. ""The group provides them with a platform to exchange and explore ideas, and the revenue collected enables the members to cater for their basic needs."" Ruziga believes that the future depends on women taking an active role in their future and says her community is happy with the help and encouragement Legend offers them. For Legend, Ruziga's passion is inspiring and motivating.  Watch Legend visit with Ruziga and her group during his trip to Mbola » .

"A 90-year-old Icelandic man who lost his wedding ring in 1949 has had it returned just in time to celebrate his 65th wedding anniversary. Oskar Jonsson from Dalvik, a village in northern Iceland, had lost the wedding ring given to him by wife Elin Sigureoardottir, 85, just after they were married, and thought that it had fallen off on the road while he was clearing the snow. But in reality he had taken the ring off to do some repairs on machinery at his garage, and had placed it on a wooden ruler before forgetting about it. Still together: Oskar Jonsson had lost the wedding ring given to him by wife Elin Sigureoardottir just after they were married . The ruler had fallen behind the table, and remained there for the next 64 years until new garage owner Brynjar Aeoalsteinsson had called in workers to clean out the junk. He said: 'The place was a complete mess and I wanted it done up and made to look nice and they took everything out that was on the floor. 'One of the young lads that was cleaning up asked me if I'd seen the ruler, and I glanced at it but didn't immediately see the ring. 'It was only when I looked at it more closely did I see there was a ring and realised it was probably a wedding ring because of the inscription ""Your Elin"".' Lost and found: Jonsson lost his wedding ring in 1949, but had it returned just in time to celebrate his 65th wedding anniversary to wife Elin Sigureoardottir . He contacted local jewellers and advertised the wedding ring on Facebook and eventually it was suggested that the woman named might be Elin Sigureoardottir. Oskar said: 'I couldn't believe it when he gave me the ring. I had wanted to celebrate our wedding anniversary in November last year by giving her a ring but I was not very well so that plan was put on hold.' But now the couple have had their celebration complete with ring in style. Oscar added: 'The ring is as good as new, although I will have to wear it on a different finger. I lost my ring finger in an accident with a saw a short while after I lost the ring, and I never wore a ring after that ever again. Still, better late than never.'","Oskar Jonsson had lost the wedding ring given to him by wife Elin Sigureoardottir just after they were married .

"(CNN) -- So much for April showers. A large and unexpected storm came barreling through the Northeast on Monday, threatening to drop more than a foot of snow in some places. Winter storm warnings remained in effect Monday night for parts of Pennsylvania, New York and West Virginia, according to the National Weather Service. Earlier in the day, Newfield, New York, was reporting 10 inches of snow, while Ridgebury, Pennsylvania, had 8 inches. More accumulation was expected, especially in higher elevations. CNN iReporter Quinten Johnson sent in a photograph from Smethport, Pennsylvania, where a sign advertising a spring bazaar was covered in snow. ""We've already seen broken branches, and we are worried about the power lines,"" he said. ""Everyone is shaking their heads and they are like -- that is life. Everyone put away their shovels and snow plows and got out their lawnmowers, and it is snowing."" The blustery blast follows a mild winter that saw little snow and the warmest March on record. ""The last time we had a big snowstorm across the East Coast was back in October,"" when fall foliage was still on the trees, said CNN Meteorologist Rob Marciano. ""This has been a crazy, crazy winter"" in the region, he said. Is it snowing where you are? Share photos and videos. Snowstorms of this magnitude are very rare for this late in April. Forecasters expect record snowfall for this time of year in some areas. The highest recorded snowfall for Pittsburgh on this date was a half-inch in 1956. Up to 5 inches of snow were forecast for Monday, the weather service said. Snowfall rates in central Pennsylvania were expected to reach 1 inch per hour at times on Monday afternoon, said CNN Meteorologist Sean Morris. One ""bull's-eye is Dubois, Pennsylvania,"" he said. Another is Erie, Pennsylvania, where snowfalls totals along the southern side of Lake Erie could reach 16 inches, Morris said. ""The snow will be heavy and wet. The weight of the snow accumulating on trees combined with gusty winds could cause branches to come down on power lines, resulting in widespread power outages,"" he said. Pete Petriani, who heads Erie's Bureau of Streets, told CNN affiliate CNN affiliate WICU that depending on how heavily it snows, crews ""may have to do a little filling up of the back of trucks just for weight if we have to go out and plow. But if it comes, we'll be ready. It won't be a problem."" Snowfall amounts of 6 to 14 inches are forecast for the Allegheny Mountains of western Pennsylvania and near Lake Erie, the weather service said. The snow won't last long, Morris said. Temperatures are expected to rise into the 40s and 50s this week, with overnight lows remaining above freezing. Late Monday morning, one weather watcher reporting to CNN affiliate CNN affiliate WIVB had recorded 5 inches of snow near Boutwell Hill State Forest, southwest of Buffalo. A public works dispatcher said 4 to 6 inches of snow had accumulated ""on the hilltops, somewhat less in the valleys"" of Chautauqua County in western New York state by early Monday afternoon. ""We have a few limbs that have fallen, nothing too big yet, nothing we can't handle,"" said dispatcher Rick Heath. ""All of our (plow) trucks are out, and we're looking at more snow tonight."" The system rained out both the Mets and Yankees baseball games on Sunday. A ""pattern shift in the jet stream over the weekend"" caused the weather change, with temperatures dropping in the country's eastern half and spiking in the west, CNN Meteorologist Sarah Dillingham said. ""This trend will continue through Tuesday and Wednesday,"" though by Wednesday, temperatures will be working their way closer to normal, she said.

But this year, your favourite festive treats could hit your wallet as hard as your waistline, with the cost of chocolate set to soar by up to a third. Crippling rises in the price of cocoa butter could add 21p to the cost of every 100g of milk chocolate by December, experts said. Totting up: Rising prices of cocoa butter will push up your average 100g sweet bite by 21p this December . It would affect everything from truffles to advent calendars and chocolate coins. The cost of producing chocolate has gone up by 33 per cent in the last year thanks to a 70 per cent rise in the price of cocoa butter, a 50 per cent rise in milk powder prices and a 15 per cent increase in whey powder costs. Cocoa powder and sugar have fallen in price, but they account for a much smaller proportion of production costs, according to the report for trade journal The Grocer. So far, chocolate makers have sheltered consumers from some of the costs. There has been a small 7.5 per cent rise in the price of a Cadbury’s Dairy Milk bar, while a box of Quality Street costs 14.3 per cent more. It could have an impact on all chocolatey treats - from brownies to truffles; advent calendars to coins . But with peak season approaching, there may be price hikes to come ahead of the Christmas rush. Cocoa butter makes up around a quarter of the production cost of milk chocolate, said analysts Mintec. Prices are currently at a four-year high of £4,000 a tonne, a 70 per cent increase on this time last year. Bad weather has hit the key growing region of Ivory Coast, leading to a lower supply and a poor forecast for the 2013/14 crop, while demand is unusually high. Mintec analyst Liliana Gonzalez said:  ‘Rising cocoa butter prices and inflation on other key ingredients have taken their toll on chocolate manufacturers.’ Upmarket maker Thorntons has put prices up by an average 11.5 per cent in the last 12 months, said The Grocer. But in contrast, the price of a box of Celebrations is currently the same as this time last year, while a box of Roses costs only 1.3 per cent more.","Rising cost of cocoa butter will push every 100g of milk chocolate up 21p .

"A husband has told of his grief for his Jehovah's Witness wife who reportedly died after refusing a blood transfusion. Adeline Keh, 40, suffered a fatal infection after giving birth by Caesarean section to her son at Homerton Hospital in east London, her distraught husband Kwaku said. She was transferred to the Papworth heart and lung hospital in Cambridge, where she is said to have refused a blood transfusion and died a month after the birth. Distraught: Kwaku Keh (left) has told of his grief for his wife Adeline (right). The new mother, a Jehovah's Witness, reportedly died after refusing a blood transfusion when she developed an infection . Homerton chiefs have launched an independent review of the tragic case, which was one of four new mothers' deaths at the hospital in nine months. The inquest into Mrs Keh's death found her decision to refuse blood 'may have compromised the final medical intervention', according to a report in the Evening Standard. It was also listed as a cause of death alongside acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and an infection of the Caesarean wound. Mr Keh, a lawyer from Walthamstow, east London, told the Standard he was devastated that 'we never got to come home as a family'. Close: Lawyer Mr Keh told the Evening Standard he and his 40-year-old wife were 'best friends' He added: 'My wife and I were best friends... I was overjoyed and could not wait for them to come home. 'Each time I went to pick her up [from the Homerton] I was told that she could not come home. Eventually my wife lost her fight and passed away.' Jehovah's Witnesses refuse to accept blood transfusions because they say blood represents life, and only God is the giver of life. That belief has led to scores of controversies, many of which have ended up before judges. Last year an Australian cancer patient who was just four months from turning 18 lost a court bid to refuse blood because he was still underage. And in March an English High Court judge gave permission for a baby heart disease sufferer to undergo blood transfusions despite the objections of his parents. A specialist told Mr Justice Keehan the cardiac patient, just a few weeks old, had no 'long-term prospect of survival' without the procedure. Yet the religious movement insists it is 'totally unfounded' to say many Witnesses, including children, die each year after refusing blood. A statement added: 'Surgeons regularly perform such complex procedures as heart operations, orthopaedic surgery, and organ transplants without the use of blood transfusions. 'Patients, including children, who do not receive transfusions usually fare as well as or better than those who do accept transfusions. 'No one can say for certain that a patient will die because of refusing blood or will live because of accepting it.' Mrs Keh's case has prompted a review at Homerton Hospital because it was one of four deaths of new mothers in a nine-month period. 'Mrs Keh’s was a very sad case and our thoughts are with her family,' a spokesman told MailOnline. 'Each case was different and there were no obvious similarities, and each was reported to the Coroner’s office for review as is routine in these circumstances. 'As well as being reviewed internally, two of the cases have also been the subject of review by the Care Quality Commission inspectors during their visit to the hospital earlier this year and nothing remiss was found. Reivew: NHS England is independently reviewing the circumstances which led to the death of Mrs Keh . 'We are now working with NHS England to seek a further independent review of the cases to see if any further lessons can be learnt. 'Over 6,000 babies are now born at Homerton Hospital. We are seeing more high risk mothers due to a number of factors including: the increase in women having babies who have other clinical complications or conditions; and the fact that high risk women are referred to Homerton as it has a tertiary level neonatal intensive care unit. 'The message to mothers is that we offer a top quality service with one of the biggest throughputs of mothers and babies in the capital.'","Adeline Keh infected after birth of her son at London's Homerton Hospital .

"By . Jill Reilly . Nong Kaem, 13, was raped and murdered on an overnight train in Thailand . A 13-year-old girl was raped and murdered on an overnight train in Thailand before her body was shoved on to the tracks. Nong Kaem went missing on Saturday night as she slept during a return journey with her sisters from the southern province of Surat . Thani to the capital, Bangkok. Her body was discovered three days later near the train tracks in Prachuap Khirikhan . province's Pranburi district according to police. The route is popular among backpackers traveling back from Thailand's island and beach resort destinations. 'She wanted to be an angel, she wanted to be an air hostess,' Nong's mother said today. 'If she was still here I would do everything to support her, but now I have nothing left.' Her sister wrote on Facebook: 'Kaem, I am so sorry that I failed to look after you. I am a terrible sister. Please forgive me,' she wrote, according to the Bangkok Post. Police have charged a 22-year-old train cleaner with rape and murder. A police spokesman said in a televised statement Wanchai Saengkhao had confessed to taking drugs before committing the crimes and throwing the girl's body out of the train. Today he was taken back to Wangpong train station where the same train Nong Kaem travelled on was stopped for a re-enactment. He told police he had been drinking with other employees when he left them and switched off the light in the car before he climbed into the girl's bed. Saengkhao said he strangled her until she passed out and raped her. He said that she regained consciousness during the horrific attack, but he strangled her again. He took her iPhone and iPad before pushing her body out of the train window. Her body was discovered three days later near the train tracks in Prachuap Khirikhan province's Pranburi district according to police (file photo) He told police he then took her her bag and sat in the train until it arrived in Bangkok. Saengkhao confessed to the crime after he was tracked down via his victim's mobile phone. Wanchai sold the girl's phone to a shop owner in Bangkok, who took a copy of his I.D. which was later passed to police. He faces charges of rape, concealing a body and murder, which carries the death penalty. He also allegedly confessed to raping two other women reported the website. On Instagram, Thai entertainment stars and celebrities joined the chorus of calls for the law to be changed to make rape punishable only by death. Convicted rapists now face a sentence of four to 20 years in prison and a fine. Nonthawan 'Maeya' Thongleng, the recently-crowned Miss Thailand World 2014, displayed a poster on Instagram calling for a change in the law and commented: 'I've always thought of this. I want it changed already. Be more strict, please.' A petition on the online social movement website Change.org that called on Thailand's military leader to make such a legal change attracted nearly 15,000 signatures within one day. Thailand's army ousted an elected civilian government in May. 'The offenders, once arrested and sentenced, usually get pardoned and released from jail. And when they get out, they commit the crime again and again to the point that judicial power in Thailand is no longer sacred,' the petition read. Col. Winthai Suvaree, a spokesman for the ruling junta, said its leader, Army Commander Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, urged the authorities to quickly prosecute the perpetrator and called on the relevant agencies to seek extra safety measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring. 'We must call a meeting with every side involved and will have to revise our recruitment process,' State Railway of Thailand governor Prapas Chongsa-nguan told The Associated Press.","The body of the girl was discovered early Tuesday morning in grass .

Out of stock: Clothing, dolls and soft toys based on the blockbuster animated musical Frozen have sold out. Pictured here is a teenage Elsa the Snow Queen, voiced by Maia Mitchell . That, of course, meant the inevitable demands followed for toys and costumes like Elsa's shimmering blue dress or Anna's caped ensemble and plaited wig. But demand became so high both sides of the Atlantic that Disney started selling out as stock ran low. Disney even had to impose quotas on some of the . merchandise to create an 'equitable way' to buy the most popular . stuffed animals and dolls.

In the UK, as Frozen-mania gripped Britain's schoolchildren, Disney admitted that the industry had underestimated the film's success. Now, Disney says relief is on the way. Hit film: Anna, voiced by Kristen Bell, left, and Kristoff, voiced by Jonathan Groff, in a scene from the animated feature Frozen . Dresses based on Disney's mega-hit Frozen have been selling on eBay for £600 . At the end of March a post on UK parenting forum Mumsnet showed the extent of . the problem. User olafthesnowman wrote: 'I need desperate help . mumsnetters!' before explaining that the only place to find an Elsa . dress costume in size 7 to 8 was on eBay, where the £18 dress was selling . for upwards of £80. The post received several replies, with users saying . they had found 'Frozen stuff a nightmare to get hold of'. And while Disney Elsa costumes are selling for as much as £600 on eBay and more than 25 bids on some lots, costume-makers are jumping on the bandwagon to create their own Frozen-inspired outfits for young fans at the price of up to £100. Online marketplace Amazon tells a similar story, with dresses on sale for more than £150. 'The popularity of Frozen has been . phenomenal,' a Disney UK spokesman told The Observer. 'We are thrilled that . audiences have connected with the characters and story in the way that . they have and we are working hard to keep bringing additional product . into stores as quickly as possible.'

Frozen, based on Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale The Snow Queen, is officially a blockbuster franchise after it overtook Toy Story 3 in March to become the highest grossing animated film of all time, raking in $1 billion (£644.5 million) at the box office. It was in the UK box office top 10 for more than three months and now ranks as the 10th highest grossing film in cinema history. Despite a lukewarm critical response, the film won two Oscars, and its songs, penned by Broadway duo Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, topped the US Billboard 200 chart for 13 consecutive weeks. A Broadway musical is also now in development.","Disney confirms more clothing, dolls and soft toys are on their way .

"Britain’s spy chiefs have launched a recruitment drive for Russian-speaking agents amid mounting tensions with the Kremlin. MI5, responsible for protecting the UK against terror attacks and other security threats, has placed an advert on its website calling for Russian language specialists to apply. The drive comes amid warnings of a new Cold War between Russia and the West as tensions continue to rise over the military stand-off in Ukraine. A new recruitment campaign for Russian speaking spied has been launched by MI5 and the Government’s eavesdropping centre GCHQ . Up to 50 Russian spies are said to be operating in Britain, with ex-MI5 boss Jonathan Evans claiming there has been ‘no decrease in the number of undeclared Russian intelligence officers in the UK’ since the end of the Cold War. In 2010 Russian Katia Zatuliveter was accused of being a Kremlin spy after it emerged she had had an affair with Commons Defence Committee MP Mike Hancock. She denied the claim and later won an appeal against deportation from the UK. The scandal came after a ring of 10 Russian spies were rounded up and deported from the US. One of the spies, Anna Chapman, had lived and worked in London before marrying and gaining a British passport. The new recruitment campaign is being run jointly with Government’s eavesdropping centre GCHQ, which gathers intelligence for the Government and Armed Forces by tapping phones and monitoring the internet. Russian spy Anna Chapman (left) was deported from the US in 2010 while Katia Zatuliveter was accused of being a Kremlin agent who had an affair with Liberal Democrat MP Mike Hancock while working for him in Parliament . MI5 are also looking for Mandarin-speakers following increasing tensions with China over British ‘interference’ over the civil rights protests in Hong Kong. A job vacancy advert placed on the MI5 website reads: ‘Coming soon: A recruitment campaign for Russian language specialists/linguists in conjunction with our sister agency. ‘This will launch in mid-November 2014 and will be an exciting opportunity to match your language skills to a position in MI5 of GCHQ.’ Another similar advert for language specialists is also listed online but with ‘Russian’ replaced by ‘Mandarin’, the most-spoken language in China. MI5 chief Andrew Parker (left) and the head of GCHQ, Robert Hannigan (right), are advertising for Russian speaking spies . The Mandarin advert states that posts will also be open at MI6, which is responsible for intelligence gathering overseas. The two adverts offer salaries of up to £30,000 in London, where MI5 and MI6 are based, and in Cheltenham, home to GCHQ. British relations with Russia have plummeted over the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, prompting the UK, US and EU to impose economic sanctions. Tensions with China, a global superpower, have also heightened in recently over the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, a former British colony.","MI5 has placed job advert on website calling for Russian language specialists .

"Scores of Japanese citizens filed a lawsuit Monday in an effort to block the restarting of a nuclear power facility as tensions remain over atomic energy in the country a year after the Fukushima Daichi disaster. The suit, filed at Osaka District Court by a group of 259 citizens, seeks an injunction to stop the company Kansai Electric from bringing its nuclear power plants Oi Unit 3 and 4 back online, according to Green Action, an organization that campaigns against nuclear energy in Japan. The Kansai Electric facility in question is in the central prefecture of Fukui. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant was knocked offline after the massive earthquake and tsunami that struck the east coast of Japan on March 11, 2011. That resulted in a meltdown of three reactors, with radiation leaking into the air and contaminated water spilling into the sea. While no deaths were attributed to the nuclear crisis -- the worst since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster -- more than 100,000 people remain displaced from the towns where its fallout settled. It has left lingering unease among Japanese people about the use of nuclear power to meet the country's energy needs. The government began safety inspections of the country's nuclear power plants. Of Japan's 54 reactors, only two are currently operating. Green Action also held a rally after filing the lawsuit against Kansai Electric. Ahead of the suit, Kansai Electric declined to comment on the matter.","A group of citizens seeks an injunction to block the restart of a nuclear facility .

"Paris (CNN) -- A furnace exploded Monday at a nuclear site in France, killing one person and injuring four, a spokeswoman for French energy company EDF told CNN. There was no radioactive leak or waste released, she said. The French nuclear safety agency also said there had been no radioactive leak. The explosion happened at a center for processing and decommissioning nuclear waste, said the safety agency, which is known by its French acronym ASN. The agency has sent inspectors to the site, it said in a statement. The explosion took place in Marcoule, in southeastern France, the EDF spokeswoman said, declining to give her name in line with company policy. The building housing the furnace was not structurally damaged by the explosion, an official at the plant said. Different activities take place at the large-scale site, including research by France's Center for Atomic Energy, said a spokeswoman for Areva, a nuclear company that has operations at Marcoule. Areva dismantles nuclear facilities at the site, she said. There are no nuclear power plants in Marcoule, the spokeswoman said, declining to give her name. Weapons-grade plutonium was once produced at the site, one of the oldest nuclear facilities in the country, but France no longer produces plutonium. The location is not far from the Cote du Rhone wine region. Ed Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists in the United States said he does not know of any comparable facilities there, but he said the incident in France shows that processing even low-level nuclear waste carries some risk. The incident could affect the debate over what the U.S. does with its spent nuclear fuel, said Lyman of the nuclear watchdog group. Currently, nuclear plants store the fuel in pools and in dry casks. Some say that it should be processed for reuse, as is done in France. But Lyman said that reprocessing creates large amounts of low-level waste and that Monday's incident shows the risk of dealing with even that kind of waste. France relies heavily on nuclear power, which now accounts for about 80% of the country's electricity production, according to the U.S. State Department. The French government has been reviewing the country's dependence on nuclear energy after the nuclear disaster at Fukushima in Japan in March 2011, which was triggered by an earthquake and tsunami. There have been no serious suggestions from mainstream politicians that France reduce its dependence on nuclear power, the State Department says. CNN's Dheepthi Namasivayam, Saskya Vandoorne, Jim Bittermann, Mike Ahlers and Josh Levs contributed to this report.","NEW: The blast could affect the U.S. debate about spent nuclear fuel, an expert says .

Stranded in the wilderness after four days of walking and with a pair of hungry wolves following his every trudging step, a Russian hunter dropped face-first into the snow ready to die . But as the ravenous animals closed in on Spiridon Vinokurov, a rescue helicopter spotted his lifeless body in the snow and airlifted him to hospital. The 48-year-old is now recovering having suffered severe frostbite during the ordeal in Russia's most hostile terrain. Rescue: Spiridon Vinokurov, 48, was found by a helicopter rescue team lying face-first in the snow 80km from Berelekha village in the Sakha Republic . In pursuit: Mr Vinokurov said that two wolves had been following him and closed in as he became more tired . After four days of disorientation, Mr Vinokurov described how he could only muster enough energy to crawl along the ground, saying that he could 'literally feel the wolves breathing down my neck'. A rescue team had been alerted by the hunter's family after he went missing during a snow storm. He had been travelling on his snowmobile to visit them in the village of Aleko-Kyuel, 120km from his lodge. Mr Vinokurov's only option was to walk through the thick snow in the hope that he would stumble upon help, knowing the wolves were near, after the petrol had run out in his vehicle. Describing the ordeal, he told the Siberian Times: 'I was driving and checking the traps set along my way. But then I kept missing the signs of the coming snow storm. 'So I lost my way and then the petrol run out in my Buran. I kept on walking.' 'Two wolves were following me along the . way.

"(CNN) -- Such is the level of pressure heaped on football managers, it is unsurprising that now and then they might say or do something that gets them into trouble with someone. The latest incident has seen Manchester City boss Mark Hughes accusing Arsenal's Arsene Wenger of ""not knowing how to behave"" after the Frenchman refused to shake the Welshman's hand after the Gunners' 3-0 English League Cup defeat on Wednesday night. It is not the first time Wenger has made the headlines for the wrong reasons, but he is certainly not alone. Fanzone takes a look at football's top-five misbehaving managers. 1. Arsene Wenger . In recent years, Wenger has been involved in touchline confrontations with Tottenham Hotspur counterpart Martin Jol and West Ham's Alan Pardew, and exchanged words with Jose Mourinho. But his most bitter rivalry has been with Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson. For about a decade, the two clubs contested for the English Premier League, with the two coaches engaged in a volatile war of words. The rivalry reached a peak in 2004 when United ended Arsenal's 49-game unbeaten streak with a 2-0 win at Old Trafford. After the match both coaches and players exchanged words before a slice of pizza was allegedly flung into Ferguson's face -- the incident has been referred to as 'Pizzagate' or the 'Battle of the Buffet' ever since. Tensions have since subsided. 2. Alex Ferguson . Ferguson's mind games over the past year have mostly been reserved for Liverpool's Rafa Benitez and referees. It was a stinging criticism of the latter that has arguably caused the Premier League's biggest controversy this season. After Manchester United grabbed a late equalizer at home to Sunderland, Ferguson in his post-match press conference proceeded to label referee Alan Wiley unfit in comparison to continental officials. After the threat of a lawsuit, Ferguson offered an apology -- albeit a fairly half-hearted one. 3. Luis Aragones . In his native Spain, Aragones will likely be remembered for leading the country to their first major trophy since 1964 when they won Euro 2008. Elsewhere it might be for when, in a training session in 2004, he was filmed making a racially offensive remark about Thierry Henry in an attempt to motivate the Frenchman's then Arsenal teammate Jose Antonio Reyes. The comment caused a particular storm in England, with many in the media calling for Aragones' job. He was later fined $3,425. 4. Diego Maradona . Maradona has been no stranger to controversy throughout his career, and has kept up that trend since becoming Argentina manager. In October he launched a scathing and foul-mouthed outburst at those who had criticized him during Argentina's qualifying campaign. The rant caused FIFA to ban him football for two months and fine him $24,603. 5. Jose Mourinho . For all his success in football management, Mourinho is equally well-known for his brash and cocky manner, a trait that has caused fans to love and loathe him in equal measure. His penchant for speaking his mind has seen him accuse referee Anders Frisk of consorting with then Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard at half-time during a Champions League tie (the official later retired due to the aftermath, having received death threats). Also while in charge of Chelsea, he once labeled Wenger a ""voyeur."" Less verbally, he risked the ire of Liverpool fans when he proceeded to shush them during the 2005 League Cup final after Chelsea scored. The most memorable occurrence came during the London club's 2005 Champions League quarterfinal versus Bayern Munich. Banned from the game, it was reported that Mourinho was secretly wheeled in and out of the changing-rooms in a washing basket, and that during the game he fed information to fitness coach Rui Faria through an earpiece under his hat.","Mark Hughes accuses Arsene Wenger of ""not knowing how to behave"" after a defeat .

"By . Damien Gayle . A BBC tennis commentator said sorry to former GB Davis Cup captain David Lloyd after suggesting he could be prevented from leading the Lawn Tennis Association because of alleged 'personal problems' Andrew Castle was forced into the official apology after his comments during a rain delay chat with Sue Barker at the Aegon Championships at Queen’s Club in Kensington, London. He has agreed to pay undisclosed damages to Mr Lloyd. Tennis commentator Andrew Castle, 49, has apologised to former player David Lloyd, 65, right, after suggesting alleged 'personal problems' could rule him out of becoming chief executive of the Lawn Tennis Association . Mr Castle made the remarks during the AEGON tennis championships at London's Queen's Club on June 12 . Interest around succession at the LTA . has been heightened by the widespread disbelief at recent revelations . that current chief executive Roger Draper was earning £640,000 a year. He is due to stand down in September and leaves what is regarded as a generally under-performing organisation. A statement published on the BBC website said: 'BBC commentator Andrew Castle suggested there were issues in the personal life of David Lloyd which made him unsuitable to be considered for the role of CEO of the LTA. 'Mr Castle would wish to make clear that his comments were without foundation and apologises to Mr Lloyd for any embarrassment or distress caused.' It is understood businessman Mr Lloyd was alerted about the disparaging remark by his brother John, a BBC tennis pundit who will be working alongside Mr Castle at Wimbledon. A joint statement release by the men today, seen by The Guardian, said: 'The parties have now agreed terms to bring the matter to a close, which involves the payment of damages and legal costs. Andrew Castle's apology to former tennis champion Mr Lloyd was put on the broadcaster's website . Sue Barker, left, and Andrew Castle, right with French player Jo-Wilfied Tsonga, cover Wimbledon for the BBC . 'However, Mr Castle would like to put the record straight and express again his personal apology to Mr Lloyd. He made his remarks, which were completely without substance, in the hurried exchanges of a live debate. 'Mr Lloyd has accepted Mr Castle's apology and the payment of damages. Mr Lloyd and Mr Castle are pleased to have been able to resolve matters amicably and now consider the matter to be behind them.' Mr Castle's gaffes didn't end there. He was accused of causing ructions by announcing at Queen’s that Andy Murray was donating his winnings to the Rally Against Cancer charity fund when the Scot wanted to keep it private. Murray said: ‘I haven’t spoken to anyone about it.' Roger Draper will stand down from his £640,000-a-year job at the LTA in September . Andrew Castle was speculating over the future head of the Lawn Tennis Association, based in Roehampton . Mr Castle was a professional tennis player for six years from 1986 and was a regular member of the British Davis Cup team.  He represented England in the Olympics twice, and reached the third round in the 1987 US Open, losing to Boris Becker. He became a television presenter after retiring from tennis in 1992, and hosted GMTV for a decade.  He has commentated on tennis for 10 years, working alongside Tim Henman, Boris Becker, Sue Barker and John Lloyd. David Lloyd, who was born in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, was one of the most successful British tennis players of the 1970s and 1980s, alongside his younger brother, John. He captained the British Davis Cup team, and went on to found a successful chain of eponymous health and leisure clubs.  He has coached Tim Henman, and is a keen art collector.","Castle, 49, made comments during rain delay with colleague Sue Barker, 57 .

"Ousted: Juan McFarland has been removed from the Alabama Baptist church he has led for 23 years . A pastor has revealed in a series of sermons that he has used drugs, has AIDS and knowingly had sex with parishioners in church grounds while suffering from the disease, according to reports. Following his series of confessions, Juan Demetrius McFarland has been removed from Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama as his stunned congregation tries to come to terms with his revelations. McFarland, who has led the church for 23 years, first revealed to worshipers in mid-September that he had contracted HIV in 2003 and was diagnosed with AIDS in 2008. At first, the congregation offered their sympathy and support. 'The church was very accepting of Reverend McFarland and was willing to help him in any way possible,' an unidentified church member told WSFA 12 News. But after he returned to the pulpit, he revealed that he had used drugs - including cocaine - while pastor and used church funds to pay for business trips that he then didn't take, AL.com reported. And there was more. 'He concealed from the church that he had knowingly engaged in adultery in the church building with female members of Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church while knowingly having AIDS,' said church deacon Nathan Williams Jr. Shocking: McFarland, pictured delivering a sermon at the church earlier this year, revealed that he had taken cocaine while pastor, misused church funds for trips he didn't take and had sex with churchgoers . Whether or not he told all of his sexual partners that he had HIV or AIDS is yet to be determined, but one church-goer said she would be undergoing tests to see if she had the disease, WSFA reported. 'My heart goes out to her because she's been a wonderful church member, and then for something like this to happen,' the church member said. 'The fact that he didn't tell them at all. That's a crime in itself.' Charges have not been filed against McFarland, 47, although some church members are calling for his prosecution. A former Shiloh deacon who heard his sermons told AL.com that McFarland is not taking medicine to treat his illness. After his most recent sermons, deacons voted on October 5 to remove him as pastor. On Sunday, Montgomery police were called after church members started fighting with each other but no one was removed. Williams said he thinks police were called on people who had voted the pastor out. Scene: After being removed from the church in Montgomery, Alabama (pictured), McFarland reportedly changed the locks and now other church leaders are seeking legal counsel . The spat has since continued, with McFarland and some newly appointed staff changing the locks on the church on Monday morning, AL.com reported.

"(CNN) -- Five people, including a married couple, have been arrested in Europe on suspicion of terrorist activities, a senior Belgian counterterrorism official with knowledge of the case told CNN Sunday. Belgian, Dutch and Turkish police launched a joint monthslong investigation that included extensive surveillance of a suspected terrorist cell with ties to jihadist groups in Syria, the official said. ""Their links to groups in Syria have been complex to untangle, but point towards ISIS,"" the official told CNN. The couple -- Dutch nationals of Turkish origin -- were arrested August 6 at Brussels Airport on their way back from a two to three day trip to Istanbul. A third suspect was arrested in Belgium. A fourth suspect was arrested in the Netherlands and a fifth was arrested in Turkey. Several of the alleged members of the cell, who traveled frequently between Belgium and the Netherlands, were of Turkish descent, the official said. All five remain in custody. Authorities moved quickly to make the arrests after police learned the alleged cell had gotten handguns. The weapons were recovered in a raid on one of the suspects' Brussels residence on August 6. In the Netherlands, electronic media was seized during a raid in The Hague, including terrorist propaganda materials, the official said. ""It was obviously worrying when we discovered they'd obtained weapons,"" the official told CNN. ""We were concerned they might be planning an attack here [in Belgium], but we still don't know what if, anything, they were planning."" The official said there was no evidence he knew of that the suspects were planning to attack the European Commission in Brussels, as some media reports in Europe have speculated. Belgian security services have become increasingly worried about the threat from fighters returning from terrorist safe havens in Syria and Iraq. In May, Mehdi Nemmouche, a French ISIS fighter, allegedly killed four people at a Jewish museum in Brussels. Nemmouche, who allegedly guarded French hostages while he was in Syria, was arrested in France after the shooting and extradited to Belgium to stand trial. European officials believe about 2,000 EU citizens have answered the call to jihad in Syria, including the wives of fighters. Perhaps 500 to 1,000 of them have joined ISIS, officials say. In June, a Belgian counterterrorism official told CNN that authorities were aware of 150 Belgian fighters in Syria, most of them with ISIS. Up to 15 more were leaving every month. About 35 are thought to have been killed, and 60 to 70 had returned home. Round-the-clock surveillance is impossible for all but a very small number because of the prohibitive expense.","A married couple -- Dutch nationals of Turkish origin -- are arrested at Brussels Airport, official said .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A U.S. soldier convicted of rape and murder two decades ago will be executed December 10 in the nation's first military execution since 1961, the Army said Thursday. Pvt. Ronald Gray has been on the military's death row at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, since 1988. A court-martial panel sitting at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, unanimously convicted him of committing two murders and other crimes in the Fayetteville, North Carolina, area, and sentenced him to death. Gray's execution by injection will be carried out by Fort Leavenworth soldiers at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana, the Army said in a news release. Gray was convicted of raping and killing a female Army private and a civilian near his post at Fort Bragg. He was also convicted of the rape and attempted murder of another fellow soldier in her barracks at the post. Both military and civilian courts found Gray responsible for the crimes, which were committed between April 1986 and January 1987. Gray pleaded guilty to two murders and five rapes in a civilian court and was sentenced to three consecutive and five concurrent life terms. The general court-martial at Fort Bragg then tried him and in April 1988 convicted him of two murders, an attempted murder and three rapes. In July, President George W. Bush approved the Army's request to execute Gray. ""The president took action following completion of a full appellate process, which upheld the conviction and sentence to death,"" the Army said in the news release. ""Two petitions to the U.S. Supreme Court were denied during the appellate processing of Pvt. Gray's case."" Members of the U.S. military have been executed throughout history, but just 10 have been executed with presidential approval since 1951 under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the military's modern-day legal system. The Army also sought Bush's authorization to execute another condemned soldier, Pvt. Dwight Loving, who was convicted of robbing and killing two cab drivers in 1988. The last U.S. military execution was in 1961, when Army Pvt. John Bennett was hanged for raping and attempting to kill an 11-year-old Austrian girl. Bennett was sentenced in 1955. The U.S. military hasn't actively pursued an execution for a military prisoner since President John F. Kennedy commuted a death sentence in 1962. Nine men are on military death row.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A teenager physically and emotionally hurt in the Boston Marathon bombings says she was forced to leave a New Hampshire store because she had her service dog with her. Sydney Corcoran, who has post-traumatic stress disorder, had been shopping at a Nashua branch of TJ Maxx when staff said the dog - Koda - needed to be put in a cart or taken outside. The service dog has been a crucial companion for 19-year-old Sydney, as she struggles to come to terms with the terror attack in which her mother, Celeste, lost both legs. Distressing: Sydney Corcoran, pictured with her mom Celeste who lost her legs in the bombing, says a store manager confronted her about service dog Koda . Lifeline: Sydney says service dog Koda, pictured, has been vital in helping her come to terms with the attack . Sydney, who was hit by shrapnel during the explosions in April last year, describes the certified service dog as 'my little cheerleader'. She told WCVB that when the pair were in the store Koda was wearing his working-dog vest to prove he wasn't just a regular pet. The teenager claimed that the store manager approached her as she shopped and said the store's policy meant the dog would have to go in the shopping cart or leave. Sydney tried to explain Koda was a working dog and wouldn't comfortably go in the cart, but said she became upset and embarrassed, and left the store close to tears. Trauma: Celeste Corcoran, center, and Sydney, right, complete the Boston Marathon one year after they suffered physical and emotional injuries in the blast . Apology: A TJ Maxx spokesman has apologized after Sydney was told by staff at the store above that she had to put her service dog in a cart or leave . Her mom rushed to the store to try to intervene on her daughter's behalf. Ms Corcoran said she told the manager sorry wasn't good enough and that 'you just made someone with an emotional disorder so much worse.' Since the bombings Sydney has suffered with stress and was finding it hard to sleep, but Koda had started to help her heal. 'It's knowing that I have this little . support system that's all my own ... Honestly, I sleep better now,' she said of her constant companion. TJ Maxx issued a statement saying it was taking the matter seriously and regretted how the situation was treated. 'Customers . with disabilities who are accompanied by their service animals are . welcome in our stores at any time,' the statement said.

"UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino has defended the expansion of the European Championship, insisting more teams and multiple host countries will 'inject the virus of football' throughout the continent. The championship has been expanded from 16 to 24 teams for Euro 2016 while the 2020 tournament will be held in 13 different countries. The new format for 2020 is a one-off measure to celebrate the 60th anniversary of European competition but there is concern that multiple host nations will reduce enthusiasm and atmosphere during the event. VIDEO Scroll down for UEFA boss Gianni Infantino on European Championship changes . UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino claims the reforms have added a new dynamic to the Euros . 'It's a great concept,' Infantino said. 'We always have great parties when the Euros are hosted in one country but now our ambition is to organise a Euros for Europe. 'We want to inject the virus of football in the whole of Europe. 'In the 13 cities, people will feel the Euros belongs to them and it gives countries who have never hosted, the chance to host. 'They have the chance to build a new stadium and boost the development of football in their own country.' London's Wembley has won the right to host both the semi-finals and the final at Euro 2020 but other, less renowned football cities, will hold matches including Baku in Azerbaijan, Budapest in Hungary and St Petersburg in Russia. Wembley stadium in London has won the right to host the semi-finals and final at Euro 2020 . None of those three cities have ever held a European finals fixture before but there is concern that local interest will dwindle if host countries are knocked out or fail to qualify. 'Even if the national team do not participate I think there will be an enthusiasm for hosting a European Championship,' Infantino said. 'These are countries who have never organised a Euro and who would never be able to organise a Euro. 'And we have seen in the Euros before when host teams go out there is still an enthusiasm for the games.' Adding eight more countries to the 2016 finals means two sides now automatically qualify, with third-placed teams earning a play-off spot. Marseille's Stade Velodrome has been upgraded with a capacity of 67,500 and will host matches in Euro 2016 . The changes have given more hope to sides previously unlikely to go through but it has also reduced the competitiveness of the qualification stage for more established countries. 'The effect of 24 teams qualifying makes almost all the teams think they have a chance to qualify and that has created a new dynamic,' Infantino said. 'We saw Cyprus beating Bosnia, the Czech Republic beating the Netherlands, Albania beating Portugal in Portugal. 'It creates a new dynamic and it can make the qualification process even more interesting.' Infantino added: 'You develop football in Europe not only by developing football in a couple of countries but by making sure the whole of Europe feels integrated. 'Of the top 32 teams in the world, 20 are European so the quality of football in Europe is there.' Infantino addresses his audience at the Leaders in Sport conference in London on Thursday .","The tournament for Euro 2016 has been expanded from 16 to 24 teams .

Tory MP Zac Goldsmith has fuelled doubts over David Cameron’s leadership, saying he lacks vision and praising ‘magical’ Boris Johnson as his potential successor. The multi-millionaire MP openly questioned what Mr Cameron stood for and drew a sharp contrast with the clarity of Margaret Thatcher’s politics, saying: ‘Thatcherism – most people understand what that means. But if you ask what Cameronism means, you’d struggle to answer. ‘It’s not clear where we’re heading and it’s not clear what the underlying vision is.’ Zac Goldsmith said that Cameron's politics lacks vision and clarity, as he compares it to Margaret Thatcher . Mr Goldsmith went out of his way to heap praise on Mr Johnson, the Mayor of London. He said: ‘I’m a big fan of Boris, I make no secret of that. It’s very plausible to imagine him being the leader of our party one day, and I think he’d be a very good one.’ He added: ‘I see him as a very serious figure as he’s unique in British politics .  .  . whatever that magic is, he’s got it.’ The Mail on Sunday revealed last year that Mr Goldsmith had secretly offered to give up his seat representing Richmond Park and North Kingston to allow Mr Johnson to return to Westminster. Goldsmith added that talk of leadership coups against Cameron were damaging the party . He praised London Mayor Boris Johnson's 'magic' and said that he is a plausible leader of the Tory party . His remarks, in the latest edition of Total Politics magazine, come amid fresh speculation that more Tory MPs are poised to demand a vote of no confidence in their leader. Mr Goldsmith made clear that talk of leadership coups was undermining Mr Cameron and damaging the party. Zac Goldsmith was outspoken in his interview with Total Politics . The MP, who described the Prime Minister as ‘very capable’, warned: ‘It doesn’t help to have leadership attempts, speculation or conspiracy coups.’ But Mr Goldsmith called on Mr Cameron to show more ‘clarity’ in the run-up to the next Election. His criticism is the latest in a series of rows between the two men, who were once close political allies and friends. Two months ago, Mr Goldsmith – former editor of the Ecologist magazine – infuriated the Mr Cameron by forcing a U-turn on new planning laws. An outraged Prime Minister issued a stinging rebuke, saying: ‘Who does that man think he’s accountable to?’ And last year, Mr Goldsmith, who before the Election was Mr Cameron’s environmental adviser, accused the Prime Minister of ‘political deception’ for allegedly capitulating to big business over genetically modified crops. He has also said Tory plans to perform a U-turn on building a third runway at Heathrow would be an ‘unbearable betrayal’ for his constituents under the flight path. In the Total Politics interview with fellow Tory MP Rob Wilson he repeated his vow not to stand as a Tory candidate at the next Election if the runway went ahead.","Goldsmith criticised David Cameron, saying he lacks vision .

"By . Lauren Paxman . Last updated at 12:54 PM on 2nd March 2012 . A couple who tragically lost a baby daughter when their twins both got killer meningitis are overjoyed after having twins again. Julie and Brian Backhouse are thrilled after giving their three-year-old son Lukas a new little brother and sister, Jamie and Amber. Julie, 39, said last night: 'We are very lucky - and very happy.' 'Over the moon': Lukas, 3, left, with his parents Julie and Brian and twins Jamie and Amber . The family's lives were torn apart in January last year when 23-month-old Lili and her twin Lukas were struck down by deadly brain bug meningitis. Courageous Lukas fought the disease and survived, but Lili sadly died, leaving the family devastated. Now Julie and Brian, of Rainham, Essex, are battling to raise awareness of the lethal illness so others might not have to suffer the same heartbreak. Housewife Julie said: 'We went back to the clinic and were lucky enough to have twins again. Lukas was diagnosed with meningitis just hours after his twin sister, Lili, was in January last year . 'We are very fortunate. 'We hadn't planned to have kids again but losing our daughter meant that we lost our perfect family.' The mum-of-four added: 'Our son wasn't born an only child and we thought that he shouldn't have to live as an only child.' The Backhouses rushed stricken Lili to Queen's Hospital, Romford, in January 2011. The critically ill baby had refused her milk for the first time ever and had been making strange moaning sounds in the night. She also had a soaring temperature and looked grey. But hospital medics failed to diagnose meningitis and told BT engineer Brian, 48, and Julie to return in a few hours if the toddler had not improved. The frantic couple dashed back with Lili after a rash broke out all over her tiny body. But it was too late as deadly septicaemia had already set in. Later that nightmare day, Lukas was diagnosed with meningitis too. The seriously ill little boy was kept in hospital for a week as he fought the disease, before eventually being cured with antibiotics. 'He's really over the moon about having a new brother and sister,' Julie said, before adding: 'He really misses his twin. 'We have pictures of her which he looks at whenever he likes. 'I think that's helped him cope in the last year.' The couple - whose sets of twins are both a result of IVF treatment - are backing a campaign by Meningitis UK to encourage parents to trust their instincts and to keep pushing doctors if they think their child has the terrifying disease. Sorely missed: Lili, front left with her twin, Lukas, and her parents before disaster struck . They have also launched a fundraising drive for the charity in Lili's memory. 'I knew something was seriously wrong with Lili that day but I was told to come back later if she still wasn't well - so I thought there was time,' stressed Julie. 'The campaign is about encouraging parents to not feel afraid to ask for a second opinion.'

"By . Emma Reynolds . PUBLISHED: . 11:02 EST, 17 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:31 EST, 18 July 2012 . Wayne Rooney's brother was banned from the road today after being caught driving three times over the alcohol limit to buy booze for a party. The Manchester United striker's younger sibling Graham was found guilty of drink driving but blamed his friends. Dressed in a Team GB hoodie, the 24-year-old left Liverpool Magistrates' Court with friends after being handed a two-year driving ban, 150 hours community service and told to pay £650 costs. Community service: Graham Rooney, 24, leaves Liverpool Magistrates Court with a large group of friends after being sentenced for drink driving . Guilty: Rooney, just seen, leaves court with friends after receiving a two-year suspended driving ban and 150 hours community service and being told to pay £650 costs . He was arrested at his parents' luxury £450,000 house in Liverpool in April. Graham - who has a striking resemblance to his £180,000-a-week superstar brother, 26 - was held in custody for more than 14 hours. The court heard there had been a party at the house he shares with parents Wayne Senior and Jeanette. When the alcohol ran out there was a dispute over who should go to buy more, according to Rooney's solicitor Richard Derby. The lawyer claimed the East Villa player told his guests: 'I pay for everything, you're in my house so why don't you go and get it.' He was arrested after officers spotted a black Audi A3 driving erratically into the grounds of the property. Rooney was seen stumbling into the house and his manner alarmed the officers, who were concerned he was unfit to drive. The court heard he became 'instantly aggressive', threatening to sue the police for trespassing and have them arrested. Football mad: Graham, left, now plays for East Villa in the Liverpool County Premier League, while Wayne right, plays for Manchester United and England . A breath test found him to have 128mg per 100mg of alcohol in his system - more than three times the limit of 35mg. The 24-year-old, who plays in the Liverpool County Premier League, was questioned and charged 14 hours later. As he walked into the court in the . city centre today, Rooney, wearing a Team GB grey and blue tracksuit top . and dark grey combats, was flanked by two friends. He sat in the dock with his head down and fiddled with a tissue as the hearing proceeded. He had claimed at trial in June he was not behind the wheel. Prosecution counsel Mr Michael Caine . told the court: 'Mr Rooney was somewhat agitated at the police station . and it was clear he was drunk. 'After he sobered up he appeared to co-operate with police.' Close: Wayne, pictured here aged five, and Graham, aged three, are two years apart . Rooney's solicitor Mr Derby pleaded . for leniency on banning him from driving for the maximum term 'because . he was a young lad who like to pick up girlfriends.' But that was dismissed by District . Judge Miriam Shelvey, who disqualified him from driving for two years . and ordered 150 hours unpaid community service with £650 costs. She told Rooney: 'Anyone who drives with such a high level of alcohol is a danger to other people.' Graham and Wayne Rooney are known to be close and regularly spend nights out together. They, along with their third brother John, 21, grew up together as Everton fans and all three played for the youth team. But . while Wayne went on to sign for the club they supported, followed by .

"Alexandria, Virginia (CNN) -- Former U.S. Rep. William Jefferson was sentenced Friday to 13 years in prison followed by three years of supervised release for his conviction on 11 counts of corruption. Jefferson was also ordered to forfeit more than $470,000 after his conviction for using his office to solicit bribes. He will also have to pay $1,100 in special assessments. The case against the former nine-term Louisiana Democrat included allegations of influence-peddling and the discovery of $90,000 in cash in his freezer. Judge T.S. Ellis will determine at a hearing next Wednesday whether Jefferson will remain free pending appeal. Until then, he is free. ""The court's sentence today reaffirms the principle that all people -- no matter what their title or position -- are equal before the law,"" said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Mythili Raman in a statement. ""In a stunning betrayal of the public's trust, former Congressman Jefferson repeatedly used his public office for private gain. The lengthy prison sentence imposed on Mr. Jefferson today is a stark reminder to all public officials that the consequences of accepting bribes can and will be severe."" Jefferson's family was in the courtroom when District Judge T.S. Ellis handed down the sentence. He had faced up to 150 years in prison. ""This sentence should be a clear signal that our society will not tolerate bribery,"" U.S. Attorney Neil H. MacBride said in a written statement. ""It's not just another cost of doing business in government. ""Mr. Jefferson's repeated attempts to sell his office caused significant damage to the public's trust in our elected leaders. This sentence will begin to repair that damage and to restore that trust. ""Mr. Jefferson is well-known for the $90,000 found in his freezer. It is our hope that he will now be well-known for the tough sentence handed down today, showing that no one -- including our elected officials -- are above the law."" Jefferson, of New Orleans, still faces the forfeiture of nearly $500,000 -- money a jury said is linked to criminal activity for which he has been convicted. On August 5, a jury found Jefferson guilty on four bribery counts, three counts of money laundering, three counts of wire fraud and one count of racketeering. He was acquitted on five other counts, including wire fraud and obstruction of justice. He had remained free prior to Friday's sentencing. Jefferson was indicted by a federal grand jury on June 4, 2007, about two years after federal agents said they found the money in his freezer. Authorities said the cash was part of a payment in marked bills from an FBI informant in a transaction captured on video. The trial was delayed while it was resolved whether an FBI search of Jefferson's congressional office was constitutional. Defense attorney Robert Trout had asked the judge for leniency, citing Jefferson's personal history of humble beginnings and long-standing public service. Prosecutors, in turn, filed a response saying Jefferson deserved no preferential treatment since he ""still chose to cheat, steal and lie."" ""Congressman Jefferson has still not accepted responsibility for his own criminal conduct,"" prosecutors wrote. He ""still rationalizes his own unethical, illegal and immoral conduct."" CNN's Paul Courson contributed to this report.","NEW: Jefferson remains free at least until Wednesday hearing .

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @CraigHope_DM . Rolando Aarons admits he has surprised even himself in emerging as the star of Newcastle’s pre-season after working throughout the summer in a bid to win a first-team breakthrough. United manager Alan Pardew and assistant John Carver were taken aback by the sharpness of the 18-year-old when he reported for duty at the start of July. And that was enough to win him a place on the tour of New Zealand last month and last weekend’s trip to Germany, where he won rave reviews having terrorised Champions League outfit Schalke. Breakthrough: Newcastle youngster Rolando Aarons has shone during the club's pre-season campaign . Centre of attention: Aarons (left) is congratulated by Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa (centre) after scoring against Malaga . Aarons, a tricky winger with a blistering turn of pace, is likely to earn a place on the bench for the Premier League opener with Manchester City a week on Sunday. But now he’s had a taste of senior action it has left him wanting more. ‘It is up to the manager, but I’m going to try and make his decision as difficult as possible, it’s my job really,’ he said. ‘I’m no-one yet. It is just pre-season and I haven’t done anything in big games, so I’m just going to keep my head down and work hard.’ And Aarons would rather not head out on loan this season. ‘I’m hoping to get involved in a first team this season and make an impact,’ he added. ‘Before every game I pray to not be injured and just go out and be guided to a performance. ‘I worked so hard off-season. I wasn’t expecting to be pushing for the first team, so I’m surprised.But I’m happy with what I did off-season – it gave me the opportunity to do what I’m doing here.’ On the run: Aarons uses his pace to get away from Huddersfield's Phillip Billing at the John Smith's Stadium .","The winger terrorised Schalke in recent friendly .

"A trainee beautician who is blind in one eye had half of her ponytail hacked off after two boys ran up behind her and hacked at her ponytail with scissors. Emily Wilding, 17, from Northwich, Cheshire, was walking home along a main road at around 5pm after finishing work at a restaurant when the boys ran up behind her. One of them used a pair of scissors to hack at her hair, which was tied in a ponytail, before fleeing into a nearby park. Trainee beautician Emily Wilding, 17, who is also blind in one eye, was attacked as she walked home from her job at a restaurant in Northwich, Cheshire, by two boys who cut her hair with scissors . Mother Karen Wilding said: 'Emily came home and was panicking saying ""mum I think somebody has just cut my hair"" and I said ""don’t be silly"". 'But when I looked a huge chunk came away in my hand. She was devastated. Her hair means so much to her and she’s really conscious of the length of it. She’s always asking me to look at it. According to police Miss Wilding saw the boys, who were wearing hoodies, approach from behind before hearing a snipping sound as they passed her . 'I told her it could have been much worse though because she is blind in one eye already and if she had turned they could have had her other eye and she could have lost her sight completely. 'It has just completely knocked her confidence she’s been on a definite downer since it happened and she just doesn’t want to leave the house. 'She’s training to be a beautician at Hartford College and in that line of work they say that your appearance is everything so this has really knocked her.' Emily lives just five minute's walk along main roads from her workplace in Northwich town centre, but this is not the first time she has been approached on her way home. Her mother added that just last year police were called after a man approached her and asked her to go with him, before also running away. Since the latest attack the family have been supported by the local community, with a local hairdresser giving her a free haircut and extensions. Police have appealed for anyone who might have witnessed the incident, which happened last Tuesday, or have information on the two attackers, to come forward. A spokesman for Cheshire Constabulary said: 'The victim was walking along Castle Street when two males approached her from behind. 'As they went past her she heard a snipping noise and later discovered that some of her hair had been cut out. According to Miss Wilding's mother the attack has left her daughter's confidence badly shattered, so she has been given free extensions and a haircut at a local beauty salon . 'One was described as wearing a grey tracksuit with white trainers, the other one was wearing a blue tracksuit with black trainers. 'Both men are white and under five foot tall, and had their hoods pulled up at the time of the attack.' Officers say there is no indication at this stage that Miss Wilding knew either of the attackers.

"The achievements of famous Manchester United Class of 92 have been well documented – but for every success story there is a hard luck story not far away. And while the likes of Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and the Neville brothers went onto to have great careers at United – Birmingham-born midfielder Richard Flash was not so lucky. Flash was a highly rated player in the Birmingham area and had trials at both St Andrew’s and Aston Villa – but he caught the eye of United’s Midland scout and went to play for the Manchester Eagles. Former Manchester United youth player Richard Flash outside UCFB in Burnley . The Eagles alumni included both Terry Cooke and David Johnson who both went onto play for United and Flash became the captain of the team. But Flash’s career all but ended before it started when he dislocated his knee playing back in Birmingham. He didn’t tell anyone about the injury as he was under pressure to earn a contract with United. He told The Bleacher Report: ‘My knee never felt right, but I didn't tell anybody. I was under pressure to earn a United contract, more so because my injury was hampering my game, but I won a two-year contract after a few more trial games. Flash came through at United in 1993 - a year behind the likes of Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, David Beckham Paul Scholes and the Neville brothers . Manchester United youth team coach Eric Harrison with Giggs, Butt, Beckham, Gary and Phil Neville, Scholes and Terry Cooke . ‘I remember seeing Paul Scholes; he was tiny, and I didn't think he was any good. ‘I moved up to Manchester in 1993, still wearing my brother's boots; I'd always worn his hand-me-downs. I earned £39 per week and lived in digs with David Beckham near the Cliff training ground. ‘Pete Smith, another guy in the digs, didn't get a professional contract and became a postman. I didn't tell anyone about my knee, but I kept picking up niggling little injuries - probably associated with the knee.’ Paul Scholes became one of the best midfielders in his generation - but when Flash first saw him he thought he was too small . Flash went onto play for Graham Taylor at Watford . Injury was not the only problem for Flash and his Class of 93 teammates, twice they were caught drinking by Sir Alex Ferguson and warned about their futures. Flash added: ‘The class of '92 were regularly beating us 7-0 in training. I frequently tried to mark Scholes but struggled. I was fast, but I couldn't read the game as quickly as he could. He could turn and leave you for dust.’ His United career never really took off. He played a couple of reserve games and B Team games before being released. Flash went on to play for Wolves, Watford, Lincoln and Plymouth before calling time on his career in 1999 – the same year the Class of 92 reached their peak winning the Treble. Flash went to university and did a Masters degree. He now works as the head of the academic department at UCFB - a higher education institution delivering degrees in sports and the football industries - based in Burnley and Wembley. Looking back on his career, Flash added: ‘I look back at my football career with positive and negative feelings. I should have sorted my knee out when I first did it. I played too much in my early teens, and that led to an injury, but I made good friends at football and learned much, which helps with my current job.’ To read the full interview with Richard Flash go to The Bleacher Report as well as reading stories from Arnau Riera, Lionel Messi's first captain as a professional footballer and Richard Irving who played for Manchester United and Nottingham Forest .","Richard Flash was born in Birmingham but caught the eye of Manchester United scouts .

"An MI5 agent praised by Tony Blair for playing a key role in the UK’s war on terror is suing the Government after being told that he can no longer live in Britain. The 33-year-old Moroccan-born agent worked for MI5 for six years, risking his life to prevent terror attacks on the UK. He infiltrated Islamic extremist cells and worked on investigations into the 7/7 attacks on London and the Madrid bombings as well as providing intelligence which led to the arrest of Al Qaeda terror suspects. Danger: The agent leaves court with his face hidden by a hood and goggles following his 2003 arrest in Belgium . Now the Home Office has told him he has no right to remain in Britain because ministers say he has a criminal record. His case is due to be heard at a high-profile immigration hearing in May, where MI5 has been asked to give evidence. The agent, who married a British citizen with whom he has a five-year-old daughter, says he faces arrest and torture in his home country of Morocco if forced to leave. The man left Morocco when he was 15 and arrived in Britain three years later. He stayed in Finsbury Park Mosque where he met radical preacher Abu Hamza, whose followers sent him to Georgia and then Chechnya. According to legal papers seen by The Mail on Sunday, he claims that when he returned from Georgia to the UK in 2000 he was approached by MI5 and recruited as an agent. In December 2001 he was sent on a mission to Belgium to infiltrate an extremist cell but was arrested by Belgian security services. Terror: The number 30 double-decker bus which was destroyed in Tavistock Square, London, when a suicide bomber detonated his backpack bomb . He was held in solitary confinement without charge for two years before being convicted for associating with terrorists and possessing a false travel document. But in January 2004, when he faced a further two years in prison, he claims he was visited by an MI5 officer who told him then-Home Secretary David Blunkett had authorised his transfer to Britain. He claims he was offered the choice of remaining in prison in Belgium, returning to Morocco – where he faced arrest and torture – or continuing his work for MI5. The agent arrived in Britain in April on a specially chartered jet and immediately began training with MI5, including how to use fake documents and infiltrate extremist groups. He provided vital intelligence on the detonation system used by the terrorists in the 2004 Madrid bombings and helped track down extremists linked to the bombers in the 7/7 attacks in 2005. He was also sent on a mission to Ireland to infiltrate a suspected Al Qaeda cell. For this work he claims he was repeatedly told by MI5 that David Blunkett and Tony Blair were very pleased and that Mr Blair had personally made use of the intelligence he gathered from extremist groups. But in February 2006 MI5 summoned him to a meeting in a hotel in Surrey, where he was told the relationship was being terminated because he was no longer any use to them. He was offered a £10,000 bribe to leave the UK for Morocco and says in his legal claim that he chose to stay in the UK because he was promised he would be granted permanent residency if he remained. But he alleges that since he left MI5 he has been betrayed, with MI5 refusing to return his calls and the Home Office rejecting his claims for residency. He says this has caused his marriage to end. Last night David Blunkett denied he had any knowledge of the case. The man’s Belgian lawyer, Christophe Marchand, said he ‘believed he had no choice’ but to work for MI5.","Morrocan-born agent infiltrated extremist cells on behalf of British spies .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- The defense in the murder trial of a Philadelphia doctor accused of performing illegal late-term abortions rested Wednesday without calling any witnesses. Closing arguments in the trial of Dr. Kermit Gosnell are scheduled for Monday, and a jury could begin deliberations Tuesday. Gosnell, 72, is charged with four first-degree murder counts for the deaths of four babies. Authorities allege that some of the infants were born viable and alive during the sixth, seventh and eighth months of pregnancy, but were killed with scissors that were used to cut their spinal cords. Judge tosses 3 murder charges against abortion doctor . In Pennsylvania, abortions past 24 weeks are illegal unless the health of the mother is at stake. Defense attorney Jack McMahon has maintained that none of the infants was killed; rather, he said, they were already deceased as a result of Gosnell previously administering the drug digoxin, which can cause abortion. McMahon cross-examined the state's witnesses Wednesday, but did not call any witnesses for the defense. Gosnell also is charged with third-degree murder in the death of a 41-year-old Virginia woman, Karnamaya Mongar, who died of an anesthetic overdose during a second-trimester abortion. Gosnell, who operated the Women's Medical Society clinic in West Philadelphia, has pleaded not guilty. On Tuesday, Common Pleas Judge Jeffrey P. Minehart threw out three of the original seven first-degree murder charges against Gosnell as well as five abuse of corpse charges in connection with the storage of the feet of aborted fetuses. Minehart also dismissed one count of infanticide, the intentional killing of an infant. Doctor performed illegal late-term abortions, ex-employee testifies . A grand jury investigation determined that health and licensing officials had received reports about Gosnell's practices for two decades but had taken no action, Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said. When authorities searched Gosnell's office, they found bags and bottles holding aborted fetuses scattered throughout the building. Jars containing the severed feet of babies lined a shelf. Furniture and equipment was bloodstained, dusty and broken. The city's chief medical examiner, Sam Gulino, told jurors this month that as part of the investigation into the charges against Gosnell, he had to examine the remains of 47 aborted fetuses that were stored in water jugs, pet food containers and a freezer inside the abortion clinic. Victim's daughter offers emotional testimony . Minehart also dismissed six of the nine counts of theft by deception against Gosnell co-defendant Eileen O'Neill, 56, a medical school graduate who worked as a doctor at the Women's Medical Society. O'Neill, who did not have a medical license, is not charged with performing abortions but with participating in the operation of a ""corrupt organization."" Meanwhile, a gag order remains in place preventing attorneys or the jury from speaking to the media.

Designer Cris Pulsipher, co-owner of Cris & Kate’s clothing line, told MailOnline: 'Brittany had been through a discouraging time after receiving that note and we wanted to turn a negative into a positive, so we got in touch with her. 'She is such a humble and positive person. We thought Brittany was perfect for what our brand stands for - being able to dress well, not feel anxious about what you are wearing and be comfortable in clothes all day.' Ms Pulsipher runs the clothing line with business partner Kate Erwin which is available in boutiques across Utah. Miss Molina, originally from Oregon, told the Salt Lake Tribune: 'I got some cute clothes, and . they’re really nice ladies. I was trying to help them out - . promote their business.' Insults: The student posted the outfit which apparently had a 'negative effect' according to an anonymous letter-writer (left) and Miss Molina modelling for Cris & Kate's (right) On Valentine's Day, the accountancy student had been walking through the halls of her college when a male student dashed up and handed her a note. She later posted on Twitter: 'So this boy came up to me... I thought he was giving me a love note. Turns out...' The . 'helpful', handwritten advice reads: 'You may want to consider that what you're . wearing has a negative effect on men (and women) around you. 'Many . people come to this university because they feel safe, morally as well . as physically, here. 'They expect others to abide by the Honor Code that . we all agreed on. Happy Valentine's Day: The note was handed to 21-year-old student at BYU which is heavily influenced by Mormonism . 'Please consider your commitment to the Honor Code (which you agreed to) when dressing each day. Thank you.' Miss Molina then tweeted: 'I'll remember to dress in jeans, a sweatshirt and tennis shoes tomorrow. That way I don't make people feel uncomfortable.' Dozens of the student's followers commented on the derisory 'Valentine', mostly in support of the 21-year-old.

"Amy Pascal got applause from Sony Pictures employees at a town hall meeting . Embattled Sony Pictures boss Amy Pascal has gotten applause from employees at a town hall meeting where she apologized for the damage caused by her hacked emails being released to the public. Pascal, the co-chairman of Sony Pictures, is fighting to save her job after her emails revealed racially insensitive comments and snipes at some of Hollywood's biggest stars. She was joined by CEO Michael Lynton at a brief meeting with employees on the studio's movie lot in Culver City in Los Angeles. 'It devastates me that something I did or said in a second would hurt any one of you and for that I am profoundly sorry,' she said at the meeting, according to audio obtained by Good Morning America. Employees responded by applauding Pascal, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Pascal remains defiant and is refusing to step down - despite rising calls for her to be fired over the contents of her hacked emails. Her message of regret to employees - who lined up out the door to hear her speak - is part of a wider apology tour. Pascal is reaching out to movie bigwigs, including Harvey Weinstein, to apologize in advance for more leaks of her emails, according to Variety. Sony appears to be rallying behind her, as well, and is attempting to get executives at other film studios to signs a letter of support for her and for Sony. Variety reports that many movie honchos are reluctant to be drawn into the hacking scandal - or be seen showing solidarity with Sony, lest they be targeted by hackers, too. Show of support: Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton appeared at a town hall meeting with Pascal on Monday to reassure employees . Lynton called the meeting on Monday to rally employees at the film studio after it was attacked by hackers who released millions of documents. 'Our business has a strong economic foundation. This won’t take us down,' he told employees, The Hollywood Reporter says. The email leaks have garnered the biggest headlines. Pascal was forced to apologize after making racially tinged remarks about President Barack Obama. Emails also reveal a producer friend calling Angelina Jolie a 'minimally talented spoiled brat,' Pascal herself called Leonardo DiCaprio 'despicable,' a fellow executive called Kevin Hart a greedy 'whore,' and she also allegedly made a joke about TV deals being the new 'black baby' - the accessory top Hollywood stars have to have. Today, a source close to the studio told MailOnline: 'This is ridiculous. Amy was making an Orange is The New Black reference and like anybody else could have, left out the comma in the middle of writing a quick email filled with shorthand and abbreviations.' However, the personal information - including social security numbers, addresses, salaries and other details - was released for some 47,000 past and current Sony employees - a devastating security breach. Sony's stock has also fallen 10percent since the leak, which came just after Thanksgiving. Hackers - possibly either from North Korea or sympathetic to the hermit regime there -  have promised a 'Christmas gift' that will 'put Sony Pictures into the worst state.'","Amy Pascal told employees: 'It devastates me that something I did could hurt any of you'

"China’s first gay dating app Blued has just secured a whooping £18.9 million investment, simultaneously taking it’s total valuation to £189 million and making it the most popular gay dating app in the world. With an average of 15 million yearly users, most of whom live in China, it has usurped popular app Grindr which has an average of six million yearly users. David Chao, co-founder and general partner at DCM Ventures who made the investment in Blued says that he thinks the app is a great move for the gay community in China. (Left) Gay men, Lu Zhong and Liu Wangqiang, pose as they shoot their wedding photos in Quanzhou, south Chinas Fujian province. (right) What you could expect to see if you log on to Blued . ‘People [in China] are more in the closet and less open about it [homosexuality], but the beautiful thing about the smartphone is that it’s a private device,' he said. ‘Having a very private phone and being able to communicate with the gay community is a dream come true.’ Lu Zhong and Liu Wangqiang are out and proud: It was only in 1997 that homosexuality was legalised in China . The app actually boasts a similar user interface to Grindr allowing the user to scroll through thumbnail shots of potential suitors before clicking on them to send them a message. They are apparently going to use the new funding to expand the app into different countries. They are also planning to offer a premium paying service. Tinder, similarly recently announced plans to develop the app adding in paid for services and an 'undo' button in case you accidentally swipe left for someone you don't fancy. It was only relatively recently that homosexuality began to become more acceptable with in the Chinese community. Up until 1997 it was completely illegal and it was only in 2001 that it was removed from the Ministry of Health's list of mental illnesses. However, it is thought that there is still wide ranging discrimination and harassment of gay people in China. There are no laws in place to help with or prevent this. Dating apps are now part of everyday life but how do you know which one is going to find you your perfect match? We give you the lowdown so you know which app to download... Tinder . Tinder became incredibly popular in 2013 and recent research claims that the app now matches 10million new potential couples every single day. The app works by showing you a series of profiles with a set of pictures and a short description. Swipe left if you're not interested, swipe right if you are. If it's a match Tinder will let you know and you can get talking. Happn . Happn was originally launched in Paris and works by showing you people you have crossed paths with. So if you're looking to get chatting to the tube crush you were just too shy to talk to this could be the app for you. Scroll down through the app and click the heart symbol for the people you like, if they like you back it's a Crush and you can message each other. Grindr . Gay dating app Grindr is hugely popular in the UK and the United States. It shows you thumbnail shots of men who are nearby even telling you how close they are. You can chat away to the people you do like and if you find someone you don't, well, there's a block function for that too! Which app is the app for you?

"Michael Klanja, 30, died when a wall collapsed at a Melbourne building site during strong winds on Monday . A Melbourne family is mourning the death of loving father Michael Klanja who was tragically killed by a brick wall which was toppled over by a gust of wind on Monday. It is believed the builder left the upper storey of a townhouse development because he thought it would be safer working on the ground level when strong winds lashed Melbourne. But the 30-year-old died after being trapped under a rubble of a partly-built brick garage wall in Melbourne's Brighton East. It's the second tragic accident to strike the Klanja family, after Mr Klanja's mother died in a car crash. A co-worker frantically tried to rescue the father-of-two from the debris but paramedics could not revive him. Mr Klanja's family said he was a generous and loving man who was loved by all. 'Michael Klanja, husband to Isabel and father to two beautiful boys, will be dearly missed,' his family said in a statement. 'He goes to meet his mother also taken by an accident as tragic as this. 'A life that was taken too early but a life that will stay with us forever.' Scroll down for video . The 30-year-old died after being trapped under a rubble of a partly-built brick garage wall at a construction site in Melbourne's Brighton East . It is believed the builder left the upper storey of a townhouse development because he thought it would be safer working on the ground level . Mr Klanja's mother reportedly died in a car accident about five years ago. Mr Klanja was working on a two-storey townhouse development in Brighton East when strong winds hit Melbourne on Monday morning. His supervisor and family friend, Stan Bilic, was devastated to see Mr Klanja die after knowing him for so long. 'I knew the day when he was born and I (saw) it when he died as well, which is really hard for me,' Mr Bilic told reporters. Detective Sergeant Gerry Richardson said the two workers decided not to work on the upper floor due to high winds. 'They came down from the upper storey level that they were working on and they decided it would be safer to work on the rear of the construction site,' Detective Sergeant Richardson told reporters. 'They moved from the upper storey level to the rear of the premises because of the wind.' Detective Sergeant Richardson said police would investigate how the wind brought down the wall. 'We've got to look at how the wall was braced in regards to that, whether that was part of the factor of why the wall collapsed,' he said. A co-worker frantically tried to rescue the father-of-two from the debris but paramedics could not revive him . Detective Sergeant Richardson said paramedics arrived soon after the collapse but were unable to revive the man when he was freed from the rubble. Neighbour Leala Sawicki said she was lying in bed when she heard the wall collapse, but thought it was just normal sounds from the building site. 'I heard a really loud bang. I didn't think anything because I'd been hearing noises all the time,' Mrs Sawicki said. 'By the time I got up, they (emergency services) were already here.' Mrs Sawicki said she saw her neighbour trying to talk with Mr Klanja but he didn't seem to be responding. 'I could see my neighbour talking to the guy, he looked terrible.' Three pedestrians died when a building site wall collapsed in Melbourne's CBD in March 2013.","Michael Klanja was working on a townhouse development site in Brighton East on Monday morning .

"British business today throws its weight behind an in-out referendum on Europe and warns ‘the status quo is not an option’. A survey of nearly 4,000 company bosses in the UK shows more than three-quarters back giving the public a say on membership of the European Union. It also reveals that British business is becoming more Eurosceptic with growing support for quitting the EU altogether or withdrawing and securing new trade agreements. However, the majority - or 61.4 per cent of those asked in the British Chambers of Commerce poll - wants Britain to remain in the EU with powers transferred from Brussels to Westminster. Many captains of British industry want a public vote on whethere the UK should leave Europe . ‘The status quo is not an option,’ says BCC director general John Longworth in the report. ‘Ministers must pursue reform and renegotiation as a priority. ‘These results show that British businesses remain determined to see a recalibrated relationship between the UK and the rest of the European Union, with more powers exercised from Westminster rather than Brussels.’ David Cameron has promised to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s membership of the EU and hold an in-out referendum in 2017 if the Conservatives win the 2015 general election. It would be the first vote on the UK’s relationship with Europe since 1975 but it is vehemently opposed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. The BCC report shows that 53.6 per cent of firms believe a full withdrawal from the EU would be bad for business. The prospect of a referendum has also sparked outrage among Europhiles who claim that Britain would be isolated economically and politically if it left the EU. But 800 business leaders have now signed up to Business for Britain, a campaign group in favour of renegotiating the terms of UK membership of the EU. Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the group, said: ‘It is fantastic to see further evidence that business people in Britain want to have their say on the EU. ‘It would be wrong of anyone to characterise British business as being content with the current relationship with Brussels, which is why it is so important that the process of renegotiating a fundamental change in Britain’s membership begins today.’ The BCC report shows that 53.6 per cent of firms believe a full withdrawal from the EU would be bad for business. But this is down from 60 per cent three months ago while the proportion who believes quitting the EU would be good for business has risen from 18 per cent to 19.5 per cent. Over one-third of companies, or 35.6 per cent, favour withdrawal followed by new trade agreements to ensure exports are not hit. This is up from 33 per cent three months ago while opposition to such a move has fallen from 42 per cent to 36.7 per cent. But the majority - or more than six in 10 company bosses - want Britain to remain in the EU with powers transferred back from Brussels to Westminster. And although 43 per cent of business back the Prime Minister’s plan to hold a referendum in 2017 after negotiations have run their course, 34 per cent want a vote far sooner. ‘Businesses reject both the Europhile dream of further integration and the Europhobe dream of a complete exit from the EU provided a satisfactory renegotiation is achieved,’ says Mr Longworth. But he warns that the split over when the referendum should take place ‘shows that there is an impatience amongst a significant number of companies for greater clarity on the UK’s position’.","Business leaders say they want a referendum on EU membership .

"Paris, France (CNN)Joy Monroe, a tourist from Montana, has come to Paris's Pont des Arts bridge on a mission of love. To celebrate her marriage of 28 years, she attaches a padlock to the bridge's rail then throws the key into the river below. ""Our love is locked forever,"" she says. It's an act that's been repeated thousands of times, barnacling the Pont des Arts with a dense mass of ""love locks."" But its popularity is now straining both the bridge and Paris's relationship with its romantic visitors, prompting a campaign that seeks to outlaw the trend. American Lisa Anselmo and French-American Lisa Taylor Huff say they co-founded No Love Locks because the padlocks are endangering historic landmarks and have become a threat to safety. 'Vandalism' ""I understand that this is a modern expression of love and it's cool, but history should not be compromised,"" says Anselmo. ""It's almost painful to watch this vandalism."" She and Taylor Huff say the Pont des Arts, built in the 1800s under Napoleon and damaged in a 1979 barge collision, might not survive much longer unless authorities act. The bridge currently carries about 700,000 locks with an estimated combined weight of 93 metric tons -- roughly the same as 20 elephants standing on a bridge designed for pedestrian traffic. Sections of fencing have already fallen out under the weight only to be replaced by unsightly wooden panels. No Love Locks has created a petition that's collected more than 2,200 signatures. ""We just want to give back to the city we love and protect its heritage and beauty,"" says Anselmo. ""One lock is a poem; hundreds of thousands are a conundrum."" Pollution concerns . According to the official Paris website, the padlock trend started in 2008 and was initially seen as charming. But the practice quickly got out of hand, with padlocks spreading to other bridges and reappearing as quickly as authorities removed them. There are concerns that the keys thrown in the Seine will add to the river's existing pollution. Graffiti, pickpockets and vendors selling cheap padlocks have also become a problem, prompting many locals to avoid the once picturesque promenade. ""Parisians feel helpless because we don't want to appear unwelcoming to tourists,"" Anselmo says. ""But people need to understand that what you're doing is impacting the residents of the city you love."" She points out that a lock is an inappropriate symbol for love in France, a country where the main annual holiday celebrates an historic assault on a prison -- the storming of the Bastille. Olivier Passelecq, the deputy mayor of the Parisian neighborhood that includes the Pont des Arts, agrees that the locks have become invasive. ""The public has to know that a public monument is not there just for lovers,"" he says. ""[The bridge] has an historical perspective as one of the most beautiful spots in Paris between the French Institute and the Louvre."" Both Passelecq and No Love Locks want to find another place for the locks, mirroring similar schemes in Moscow and Rome. ""Travelers want to leave their mark on Paris -- it's touching and we understand that,"" Anselmo says. ""But show love to the history, to the beauty first, and maybe not putting a lock is the most loving thing you can do.""","The No Love Locks campaign seeks to outlaw the practice of affixing padlocks to Paris's historic bridges .

"By . Dan Bloom . PUBLISHED: . 13:27 EST, 7 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 06:45 EST, 8 March 2014 . A man who bought a talking toy remote control for his toddler grandson was outraged when it blurted out 'f***s' instead of the number six. Joe McManus, 61, paid Â£4.50 for the Little Tikes First Remote Control at an Asda branch in Birkby, West Yorkshire, for 18-month-old Vinnie Lydall who he said was 'mad about gadgets'. He returned it to store staff - who said they agreed it sounded rude and said they would clear all other models from the shelves. Foul-mouthed: Joe McManus, 61, was shocked when he realised the toy he bought at Asda for his 18-month-old grandson Vinnie Lydall was blurting out 'f***s' in a robotic voice instead of the number six . Hanging on the telephone: Mr McManus claimed his complaints to the firm were not taken seriously enough . But although the supermarket said Mr McManus was the only customer to complain, he fears the foul-mouthed toy could be a bad influence on other children. The grandfather-of-10 said: 'Vinnie was just sat playing with it one day pressing the buttons when we heard it. When you press the six button it says the F-word. Little Tikes: The firm said 20,000 of the toys have been sold and this was the first complaint . 'Call me old-fashioned but I believe that a child's first words should be mum or dad, or maybe please and thank you, but not four-letter swear words.' He added: 'Vinnie's mad about gadgets and will press the buttons of anything he can get his hands on. He likes to mess around with our iPad and have the Wii on, even if he's not playing on it. 'A few times he's picked up the phone and ended up calling somebody, so we thought we'd buy him his own phone and that would keep him happy.' The retired plant worker, from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, bought the plastic pink toy which he described as a phone on January 23. When he noticed the defect he returned it to Asda and complained to toy firm Little Tikes. He said: 'They agreed with me it sounded rude and gave me my money back and assured me they would make sure no more were on the shelf. 'But when I went back a couple of weeks later they had restocked the shelves with more of the phones. 'I took one to the customer service lady who said they didn't have the authority to take items off the shelves. 'She said she'd look into it but didn't really seem interested. I don't have a problem with Asda, but I think there's been a lack of communication in customer services. 'This has been going on for weeks now... I'm surprised no-one else has complained. Bad education: Mr McManus hoped the toy would teach Vinnie to count, but it taught him otherwise . Profane: Vinnie's grandmother said it was a good thing their other nine grandchildren and not picked it up . '[Little Tikes] said it wasn't their problem and advised that I got in touch with the distributors, so I sent them an email and recieved no reply.' His wife Jackie, 60, added: 'Luckily, Vinnie is too young to pick up the language, but I would be really annoyed if one of my older grandchildren started playing with it.' Vinnie is the couple's youngest grandson, and they look after him during the day while his mother Tina, 35, works as a secondary school teacher. A joint statement by Asda and Little Tikes said: 'We sold 20,000 of these products last year and this is the first complaint we've had of this nature.'","Little Tikes speaking toy crackled out 'f***s' instead of number six .

"Most people couldn't recall what row they were sitting in on a plane they boarded three years ago but a Brisbane couple have very good reason to remember every detail of the flight. Holly and Tim Moffitt sat next to each other in row 4 on a Virgin flight from Brisbane to Canberra on April 7 in 2011. During the two-hour trip, the strangers talked endlessly and exchanged contact details to meet again and the rest, as they say, is history. Holly's stepfather, Dean White, thought it would be a fitting gesture to ask Virgin Australia to write a letter congratulating them on their wedding day on October 25 this year - but the airline company went above and beyond this special request.

A thoughtful video was produced with staff members from all departments getting involved to congratulate the Brisbane couple. Staff members, Louise and Sarah, start the string of touching messages with Sarah saying: . 'Who would’ve thought all of those years ago when you sat in row 4 as complete strangers that it was meant to be – have a great day.' Then the video goes into the cockpit of the plane with Captain Chris Hartley who was joined by Officer Daniel Lloyd. 'We hope the fastened seat belt isn’t switched on or too often for any turbulence throughout your relationship – we wish you a smooth and enjoyable ride,' Officer Lloyd said. Baggage handlers, Andrew and Nathan, gave their own piece of advice: 'Whilst we deal with baggage every day - to avoid that baggage make sure you clearly communicate to one another and have a fantastic and loving and long marriage.' The video ends with Louise and Sarah toasting their glasses of bubbles to the happy couple.

They couldn't have known stepping onto the plane all those years ago that their lives would be changed forever . Baggage handlers, Andrew and Nathan, advised the couple in the video to communicate to avoid any baggage . Mr White said the footage received an rousing response at the wedding reception at Tweed Heads in Northern NSW - particularly from the overwhelmed couple. 'They were blown away, and really appreciated the efforts of those involved,' he said. 'Everyone at the reception cheered and applauded.' Even though Mr white had discussed the video with Virgin in the week and a half leading up to the wedding, he did no expect great footage, . 'We were really impressed by the extra distance mile that Virgin Australia had gone to, especially as it started out as a reasonably small request for a congratulation letter to read out at the reception,' he said. 'When we watched it we knew that everyone would love it.' During the two-hour trip, the strangers talked endlessly and exchanged contact details to meet again . The couple could never have known stepping onto that plane all those years ago - when Holly was jetting off to visit her parents while Tim was heading to a family wedding - that their lives would be changed forever. Mr White said when his daughter arrived in Canberra she was clearly smitten with the stranger she had been chatting to for the past couple of hours. 'She could not stop telling us about the great guy she had met on the flight,' he said. The couple's starkly different personalities made them a compatible match. 'Let’s just say they were keen on each other from the start,' Mr White said. 'They are polar opposites which completely complement each other.

Smiling: The US-born actress-turned-photographer, famed for appearing naked in the soft porn film Emily, is accused of taking an oil painting from her former partner . Prince Andrew’s former girlfriend Koo Stark had her trial date for stealing a painting set back because she is due to meet the Dalai Lama, it emerged today. Appearing at Hammersmith Magistrates Court she smiled as she was sent to face trial for allegedly stealing a £40,000 painting from her former partner. The hearing was to set a court date for her trial. Defence barrister Edward Henry requested she not appear until after December 18 because she has a 'longstanding commitment' with the Dalai Lama. He said 'My client has a long-standing religious engagement that requires her to travel abroad. 'She is due to see an emminent person, the Dalai Lama, after November 26th and will be back on December 16th. 'Its a long-standing religious engagement and I wonder if the court would give some consideration to that commitment?' The court then set a date of December 18th for a preliminary hearing at Isleworth Crown Court. Mr Henry asked whether December 21st could be given as he is unavailable on December 18th, but was told the court could not comply with that request. The US-born actress-turned-photographer, 56, famously appeared naked in the erotic film Emily. She is accused of taking the oil painting of a moonlit coastal landscape by Dutch master Anthonie Van Borssom from the home of her ex-partner American financier Warren Walker. Looking younger than her years and glamorous in a beige skirt suit, black top and black strappy sandals, she arrived at Hammersmith Magistrates Court in a white Fiat 500, but was forced to drive off after being refused entry to the car park. She then returned on foot and looked happy and relaxed as she entered the building. It is said she arrived at Mr Walker’s Notting Hill home with a bunch of flowers on July 21 and told the housekeeper she was taking two pictures. As the housekeeper went to get a vase Miss Stark is said to have taken a picture off the wall and the pair got in a ‘tug-of-war’ over it, it is alleged. Miss Stark lost when the housekeeper managed to hold on to it but she then ran up the staircase and took another painting before fleeing the property, it is said. Relaxed: Ms Stark looked carefree as she entered court today. It is believed she has requested her trial is after 18 December as she has a 'longstanding commitment' with the Dalai Lama . Miss Stark, whose real name is Kathleen, indicated through her solicitor she ‘strenuously denied’ the charge and was given the painting as a gift by her former lover. Miss Stark will appear at Isleworth Crown Court for a preliminary hearing on 18 December. The photographer was in a relationship with Mr Walker until he jilted her 10 days before their 1997 wedding when she was seven months pregnant with their daughter Tatiana, now 15. The pair have had a tempestuous relationship since and she once threatened to sue him for ‘emotional distress’ after he applied for custody of their daughter when she was 11. She also dated Prince Andrew when he returned from the Falklands conflict in 1981, after they met on a blind date during his leave from the Royal Navy. He took her on holiday to Mustique, she was invited to Balmoral to meet the Royal Family and there were rumours of an engagement. But the romance ended when it emerged she had appeared semi-naked in a raunchy film called Emily in 1976.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:17 EST, 6 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:58 EST, 6 September 2012 . Jealous Edith Wiredu threw boiling water over her friend . A devout Christian who driven by jealousy threw boiling water over the love rival she believed bedded her boyfriend has been jailed for five years. Edith Wiredu, 21, from Canterbury, told Terena Omoetuk, 20, they needed to 'talk' amid rumours the design student was sleeping with the lover from whom she had just split - but still cared for. Canterbury Crown Court heard that when Terena denied the allegations church-going mother-of-one Wiredu, also a student, hurled the scalding water over her. Terena was rushed to hospital with burns to a quarter of her body and has been left with scars across her chest and neck. Jailing Wiredu, Judge Edward Connell said: 'This was a wicked and nasty offence and you should count it very lucky the injuries weren’t more serious. 'This was a wholly deliberate act committed in anger and designed to injure your victim. 'This is a particularly tragic case because you have made remarkable progress in your education. However, a probation report on Wiredu, claimed she had shown no remorse for the attack in November last year. The incident happened after Wiredu confronted her friend about allegations that she had been cheating with her boyfriend. She then walked into the kitchen area of their house, picked up a bowl of boiling water and threw it over her. Miss Umoetuk told how she and fellow students had met and had been planning to attend a meeting of the university's Afro-Caribbean Society. Instead, Wiredu quizzed her friend about having sex with her boyfriend Tinashe. Edith Wiredu was sentenced to five years at Canterbury Crown Court . Ms Umoetuk told the jury: 'I said: 'No'. I was shocked and confused. She asked me again and I denied it again. 'She then started getting angry and said that I had to start telling her the truth because he had told her. But I denied it again. 'She then left and went into the living room. I followed her and as I walked in, Edith appeared with a bowl of hot liquid and threw it over me. It went over my face and chest.' She then claimed that as she fell to the floor, Wiredu grabbed her hair and tried to stamp on her head. Wiredu, who was studying tourism, and has a three-year-old child, denied inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. But she was convicted unanimously by a jury. Philip Rowley, defending, said: 'Clearly Miss Wiredu did not articulate correctly her feelings to the probation officer and she was surprised to read that she viewed herself as a victim, too. 'She wants it said that she does not view herself in that role and accepts the victim suffered deeply unpleasant injuries which will last a long time. She accepts her responsibility.'","Graphic design student left with burns covering a quarter of her body after attack .

"A middle aged couple dropped off a newborn baby girl still covered in amniotic fluid to a Lakewood, Colorado fire station on Tuesday after it was given to them at a Walmart. The baby didn't belong to the couple but was given to them by strangers at a Lakewood Walmart parking lot that morning. The fire department did not reveal any more details about the baby's biological parents but they do not believe that the middle-aged couple knew them in any way. Abandoned baby: A mother gave her newborn baby daughter, still covered in amniotic fluid, to a middle-aged couple at the Walmart in Lakewood, Colorado . Khou reports that the baby, while not wiped off, seemed healthy but was given to paramedics to ensure its safety. 'The child didn’t look like it had been completely cleaned off. Still had some amniotic fluid dried on. It just had the appearance of a baby that had just been born very recently,' said firefighter and paramedic Cody Beinlich. A law passed in Colorado called The Safe Haven Law makes it legal for the parents of an unwanted child to drop in at a hospital or fire station up to 72 hours after the birth. Any longer than 72 hours and a parent can face up to 26 years in prison. Even though the baby was dropped at a fire station, it was not delivered by the parents and therefore is not fully covered in the law. Police are searching for the baby's mother both over concerns about her health and because charges may be warranted against her. The baby's mother committed a crime of abandonment. Safe Haven:The middle-aged couple dropped off the newborn at West Metro Fire Station 1  in Lakewood who then sent the baby to the hospital for treatment . Linda Prudhomme who works with the Colorado Safe Haven for Newborns, told ABC News that since the law passed in 2000, 40 babies have been safely taken into care. 'If the couple who dropped the baby off are relatives or the parents of the baby — and made up the story about the mother in the parking lot — then the circumstances fall under the Safe Haven Law. If it is determined that the baby was legally abandoned, police will write a report but will not pursue the mother,' she said. Prudhomme said that the baby's actual mother didn’t correctly abide by the law. 'If a parent handed over the child to total strangers and they took it to a fire station, then the parent could be charged criminally, but that part of the story has not been substantiated,' said Steve Davis with the police department. Firefighters do not know the future of the baby but they said that they will always remember the bizarre day she was dropped off at their station and that the wish her the best in what's to come.","A  couple dropped off a newborn baby girl still covered in amniotic fluid to a  Colorado fire station on Tuesday after it was given to them at a Walmart .

"Lawyers for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev accused the government of imposing unduly harsh restrictions on their client in a motion filed Wednesday. Tsarnaev is ""in near total isolation,"" is banned from praying with other inmates and is allowed out of his cell only to meet with lawyers or spend short periods in an outdoor enclosure, court documents said. Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz asked the attorney general for these special administrative measures after Tsarnaev had been in prison for four months. Ortiz said the restrictions are necessary as part of what prosecutors call Tsarnaev's ""continued desire to incite others to engage in violent jihad,"" according to the August memorandum included in the court filing. Tamerlan's in-laws answer questions from grand jury . As evidence, prosecutors cite the 1,000 ""unsolicited"" letters the 19-year-old Chechnya-born American has received during his five-month incarceration. His lawyers say he has not responded to any of them. Tsarnaev has been at the Fort Devens prison facility an hour outside Boston after a brief hospitalization for wounds incurred during his capture on April 19. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, spent days on a highly publicized run after the marathon bombing on April 15. His lawyers, Miriam Conrad and Judy Clarke, argue in court papers that the measures create ""obstacles"" that have a ""dramatic chilling effect on the defense team's ability to prepare a thorough and vigorous defense."" Three friends of Boston bombing suspect plead not guilty . In their motion, Conrad and Clarke argue the measures ""violate the First, Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The court therefore should declare that the SAMs are unlawful and order that they be vacated."" The restrictions are designed to limit the people with whom Tsarnaev is allowed to speak and what those people can then say to others. It also limits the kind of materials to which he has access. As an example, his lawyers said they were prevented from showing Tsarnaev family photos after prosecutors argued they were not specifically related to his defense. Prosecutors later relented. Tsarnaev's lawyers accuse the government of trying to limit attorney-client interaction: ""There is no basis whatsoever to suspect that appointed attorneys and those assisting them would intentionally pass dangerous communications to others."" Documents detail suspect's injuries . His lawyers also said Tsarnaev has done nothing during his incarceration to warrant such restrictions or to suggest he is dangerous, nor is there evidence the attack was ""directed by others still at large or that Mr. Tsarnaev ever had operational authority to direct the activities of others"" to whom he may want to communicate. Special administrative measures are typically used in terrorism cases and other high-profile cases when authorities contend ""there is a substantial risk that a prisoner's communications or contacts with persons could result in death or serious bodily injury to persons,"" according to court documents. Tsarnaev is charged with 30 federal counts stemming from the attack, during which three people were killed and more than 250 were injured after a pair of home-made bombs exploded moments apart near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer was killed three days later, triggering the massive manhunt that led to Tsarnaev's capture. His brother was shot and killed by police during the manhunt. Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to all charges. 5 months after bombings: Sense of winning for survivor .","Lawyers say Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is ""in near total isolation""

"By . Becky Barrow . The number of people having to submit tax returns has soared to a record high of 10.7million thanks to the Government’s controversial changes to child benefit. For the first time, hundreds of thousands of parents who have never had to fill in a self-assessment tax form have been caught in a system that many struggle to understand. HMRC warned nearly 100,000 parents are at . risk of a fine of 100 per cent of the amount of child benefit that they . have received but are no longer entitled to keep. HM Revenue and Customs said record numbers of parents are being forced to fill in a tax return every year . For a parent with three children, this could result in a fine of up to £612, or £438 if they have two children or £263 for parents with one child. In January last year, around 1.1million parents lost all or some of their eligibility for child benefit after the Government controversially changed the rules. If one or both parents earn more than £60,000, they lost the benefit entirely, while those earning more than £50,000 and up to £60,000 lost some of the benefit on a sliding scale. If they have continued to receive the benefit - which they are allowed to do - they must pay back the amount of money that they are no longer eligible to receive through self-assessment. HMRC said around 461,000 parents opted to stop receiving child benefit while others have registered, or were already registered, for self-assessment. HMRC warned nearly 100,000 parents are at risk of a fine of 100 per cent of the amount of child benefit that they have received . But there are still 'just below 100,000' parents who are yet to register for self-assessment, an HMRC spokesman said yesterday. The deadline for filing their tax return for the 2012/2013 tax year to repay their child benefit was Friday 31 January. They will not be fined the standard £100 penalty for missing the deadline, but will instead be hit by a 'failure to notify' penalty because they have not registered for self-assessment. Parents should have paid back the amount that they received between 7 January 2013 - when the rules were changed - and 5 April 2013 - the last day of the tax year. Robin Williamson, from the Chartered Institute of Taxation, said HMRC had chosen a 'complicated and odd' way of clawing back the money from parents. He called for HMRC to show leniency towards parents, many of whom will be confused by the new system or not even aware of it. Mr Williamson said: 'I think it would be inappropriate for HMRC to levy the full penalties in this first year until people have really got their head around the situation.' HMRC said it will be writing to all of the 100,000 parents to warn them of the urgent need to complete their tax return. The quicker they register for self-assessment, the less likely they are to be hit by a 'failure to notify' penalty, HMRC said. There were 30 million taxpayers in 2012/2013. HMRC said 10.03million people filed a tax return before deadline day of a total of 10.74million who need to complete one. The busiest time was on deadline day when 569,847 people filed their tax return, but 1,566 also found the time on Christmas Day to send an online tax return. The number of people who have to complete a tax return has been increasing rapidly, rising by around 1.4million since the 2006/07 tax year. In a sign of the rise of the internet, just 38,000 filed their tax return online in 2001, compared to 8.5million for the most recent tax year. A tax return must be completed by people who owe money to the tax man, typically the self-employed and those with additional earnings or income on top of their main job.","Parents caught in a tax system many struggle to understand .

"By . Jack Doyle . PUBLISHED: . 16:44 EST, 14 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:44 EST, 14 October 2013 . A police force is to equip every officer and community support officer with a body-worn video camera. Staffordshire Police say supplying front-line staff with the cameras will help cut crime and speed up prosecutions. But civil liberties campaigners warned the public could be filmed unwittingly if they are not aware the camera is on. Staffordshire Police will become the first force in Europe to have every officer equipped with such devices . The force is spending £330,000 on 500 lapel-worn cameras for officers, PCSOs and volunteer specials. It will become the first in Europe to have every officer equipped with the devices. Police say video footage is much more effective in securing convictions than police verbal accounts, which can be challenged in court. They say the cameras are a huge money-saver because they save court preparation time and often force an early guilty plea. But critics have described them as an unnecessary extension of State surveillance. Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch said: ‘As a bare minimum, no member of the public should be subjected to this kind of surveillance without being fully aware it is taking place, why and how they can access a copy for themselves. ‘This is hardly a measure that will reassure communities that the police are working for them, not treating everyone as suspects to be recorded. ‘Is it worth such a serious shift in the relationship between the police and the public to save a few hours of paperwork, rather than to ask why the paperwork is there in the first place?’ Critics have described the cameras as an unnecessary extension of State surveillance . The cameras record high-definition video and can record sound from up to 20 feet away. Staffordshire’s Police and Crime Commissioner Matthew Ellis said: ‘These cameras are exceptional value for money. ‘They will free up officer time and create thousands of extra hours of visible policing. ‘It will help officers get the best possible evidence. It will protect people who are being arrested and it will save a vast amount of time by providing actual pictorial evidence in court rather than thousands and thousands of words. ‘One of my officers went to break up a fight at a pub in Newcastle the other day - and as soon as he pressed the record button, the fighting stopped.' The move was backed by frontline officers’ representatives. Andy Adams, chairman of the Staffordshire Police Federation, said: ‘I imagine that as a matter of course officers will turn on their camera during violent or domestic incidents, but they will have some discretion over when they choose to record arrests.’ In May, Home Secretary Theresa May said all officers walking the beat should wear body-mounted cameras. As well as helping convict criminals, they help make sure ‘vexatious’ complaints against officers are promptly dismissed, she said. Improvements in technology make them much more affordable than in the past. Mrs May said five forces were already using them routinely in England and Wales. They are also in use in Scotland. She told the Police Federation annual conference in Bournemouth: ‘Body-worn cameras can help improve the collection of evidence.’","Staffordshire Police the first force in Europe to equip every officer .

"Explorers have recovered Apollo 11 engines from the Atlantic Ocean floor. First recovered in March, experts have now confirmed the rocket engines recovered from three miles below the ocean surface by Bezos Expeditions are Saturn V first stage F-1’s used by the rocket that put the first men on the moon. The announcement came one day before the 44th anniversary of Neil Armstrong’s historic first steps on the lunar surface. Found!: Explorers confirmed they have recovered engines used to put Apollo 11 on it's historic voyage to the first lunar landing . The confirmation was made by conservators from the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center, who confirmed the engines’ origin by scanning their surface with black lights designed to notice even the smallest markings. They were able to discern the serial number ‘2044’ stenciled on the side of one of the thrust chambers, according to Jeff Bezos. ‘2044 is the Rocketdyne serial number that correlates to NASA number 6044, which is the serial number for F-1 Engine #5 from Apollo 11,’ Bezos explained. Further sleuthing led the team to find ‘Unit No 2044’ stamped into the base of the thrust chamber, wrote Bezos, providing additional confirmation. The recovery was made using highly advanced Remotely Operated Vehicles designed to withstand the immense pressures brought by the extreme depths at which the engines were found. They were tethered to a vessel on the surface via fiber-optic cables used to transmit data and power, according to Bezos. Identified: The serial number 2044 from the Saturn V F-1 engines used by the Apollo 11 was found using black lights to scan the engine's surface . Remarkable discovery: More than 43 years of corrosion from being on the floor of the ocean made identifying the engines difficult . The team believes it has enough components to assemble two complete engines from the historic voyage. The recovered engines powered the Saturn V rocket for just over two minutes in actual flight time, according to Ars Technica, burning more than four and a half million pounds of fuel. Once empty, the engines detached and were returned to earth by retrorockets designed to pull them away from the climbing spacecraft and into the waters off the Florida coast. Historic: The confirmation that the engines are from Apollo 11 comes on the 44th anniversary of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin's moon walk . Fixer upper: Bezos said it will take significant work to restore the engines to their original glory . Apollo 11’s celebrated flight to the moon took about four days from launch to landing, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Touching down July 20, 1969 on the moon’s surface at Tranquility Base, Neil Armstrong famously announced ‘the Eagle has landed.’ Bounding out of the spacecraft a few hours later, Armstrong famously said ‘that’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.’ Buzz Aldrin soon joined Armstrong on his famous moonwalk as millions around the world watched in awe. Less than 24 hours after landing, the astronauts began their journey back to Earth, making a splash landing in the Pacific Ocean on July 24.

"Animal-rights campaigners have criticised Instagram for allowing users to sell unwanted pets and exotic animals online.

Advertising: Some users have effectively turned their accounts into streams of classified ads for animals .

The adverts come in the form of photographs of the animals on sale, with details written in the captions, and can be read online through a computer or via Instagram's smartphone and tablet apps. Searching for #forsale brings up more than 1million offerings - most are innocuous items such as clothes, shoes and jewellery, but many are live animals.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday that Iran and China are making ""quite disturbing"" gains in Central and South America. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says the U.S. mustn't ""turn our backs on countries in our own hemisphere."" In wide-ranging comments on the region, she also said the Obama administration will work to improve relations among even its harshest critics in the Western Hemisphere, including Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, and is looking to the Castro brothers in Cuba for some reciprocal action in response to the president's easing of travel and other restrictions. Efforts by the Bush administration to isolate certain Latin American leaders had failed, she said, and the United States now must work to counter efforts by China, Iran and Russia to gain influence there. ""What we are doing hasn't worked very well and in fact, if you look at the gains, particularly in Latin American, that Iran is making and China is making, it is quite disturbing,"" Clinton said at a town hall meeting at the State Department with senior Foreign Service Officers. ""They are building very strong economic and political connections with a lot these leaders. I don't think that is in our interests,"" she said. ""We have no guarantees here that we can create a better relationship with someone who has a different view of politics, the economy and so much else. But we think it is worth trying to just explore this and see what comes of it,"" Clinton said. ""I have to say that I don't think -- in today's world that is a multipolar world where we are competing for attention and relationships with at least the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians -- that it is in our interests to turn our backs on countries in our own hemisphere."" She pointed to a large Iranian presence in the Nicaraguan capital, Managua, as an example of what other countries are doing in Central and South America. ""We are looking at how to deal with [Nicaraguan President Daniel] Ortega,"" she said. ""The Iranians are building a huge embassy in Managua. You can only imagine what it's for."" Clinton's voice was hoarse, she coughed occasionally and seemed to be nursing a cold, but she made no mention of her health. On Cuba, Clinton said the United States is awaiting a response from Cuban leaders Raúl and Fidel Castro. ""We would like to see some reciprocity from the Castros on political prisoners, human rights and other matters,"" she said. ""So we are looking at a number of different relationships and trying to figure out whether we can be more productive. My bottom line is what's best for America, how do we try to influence behavior that is more in our interest than not."" Later, Clinton appeared to be fighting back tears when she spoke at a ceremony to honor Foreign Service officers who had been killed in the line of duty. She spoke about 25-year-old Brian Adkins, who was just beginning his State Department career when he was murdered this year in Ethiopia. ""Please know how grateful we are for his selflessness and service to his country,"" Clinton said. Adkins' name and those of three other Foreign Service officers were added to a plaque in the State Department entrance.","Hillary Clinton: Obama administration trying to improve ties with even harshest critics .

"(CNN) -- Top-level female football in the U.S. was dealt a severe blow on Monday when it was announced the 2012 Women's Professional Soccer (WPS) season had been suspended. The league only began in 2009, but an expensive legal dispute with a former franchise owner has driven the board of governors to halt the five-team competition. The announcement came just 24 hours after the U.S. national women's team had beaten Canada 4-0 to win the North and Central American qualifying tournament for the 2012 Olympics Games in London. ""We are proud of what the league has accomplished in the first three seasons,"" Thomas Hofstetter, owner of the New Jersey-based Sky Blues FC, who won the 2009 WPS playoffs, said in a statement. ""But we do recognize the necessity to resolve our existing legal and operational issues so that we can continue to support and grow WPS the right way. ""This was a very difficult decision, but one we as owners feel is the best business decision for the league at this time."" The legal dispute which has forced the league to take this step is with Dan Borislow, the owner of the Florida-based magicJack franchise. Borislow brought the Washington Freedom team in 2011 before relocating it to Boca Raton and renaming the franchise after his communications company. He repeatedly clashed with WPS over a number of issues, including the size of the magicJack's stadium and reportedly failing to pay player wages. WPS took the decision on October 27 2011 to ""terminate"" the franchise, which had U.S. national team stars such as goalkeeper Hope Solo and striker Abby Wambach on its roster.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 03:56 EST, 2 December 2011 . Maybe it's a reflection of the price of televisions - or just how little cars used to go for. But more than one-fifth of young Britons admit that their current television cost more than their first car. The average Briton between 18 and 30 spent just £500 on their first car - whereas they blew an average £700 on their first television. Britons aged 18 to 30 admitted that they spent £500, on average, on their first car - enough to secure a fine vehicle such as this Renault . That's rather a lot considering you can easily pick up a 32-inch HD flatscreen for less than £300. But for the 1,993 adults polled, a TV was an 'investment'. The majority said that their reason for doing so was because they would have their TV for longer. Those that said they had spent more on their current TV than on their first car were asked to explain why. The majority, 67 per cent, said it was a better investment because ‘it would last longer’ - which certainly may be the case when a car is just £500. Priorities: Young Britons now spend £700 on average on their first television, compared to just £500 on their first car - saying TVs were liable to last longer . Another 29 per cent said it was simply because they would ‘rather have a decent TV’. When asked what the maximum amount was that they would spend on their next television, the majority, 51 per cent, claimed they would pay ‘£1,200.  The survey was conducted by website MyVoucherCodes.","Average first car costs £500 .

The Dutch couldn't repeat their quarter-final shoot out heroics against Costa Rica as Aston Villa defender Ron Vlaar missed Holland's first kick and Wesley Sneijder also failed to score. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ten of the best Argentina v Holland virals . Drama: Goalkeeper Sergio Romero saves the penalty of Holland's Ron Vlaar during the shootout . Argentina scored all four penalties to secure a place in the World Cup final against Germany in the Maracana Stadium on Sunday. Afterwards, Van Gaal - who takes over at Manchester United next week - appeared to suggest that two players refused to take kicks but wouldn't elaborate. He said: 'You need to score the first one and I asked two players to take the first ball before ending up with Vlaar. 'I thought he was the best player on the pitch so should have a lot of confidence. It just goes to show it's not easy scoring in a penalty shoot-out. Acrobatic: Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero saves a penalty from midfielder Wesley Sneijder . 'It's a very humiliating question to be asked who the players were.' A tight game ended scoreless after 120 minutes but Argentina went through after scoring with four consecutive spot-kicks. Van Gaal wasn't able to send specialist goalkeeper Tim Krul on in goal for the penalties as he did last week as he had already used three substitutes. To add to his pain, Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero once played for him at AZ Alkmaar. 'We didn't lose against them, but the penalties are down to luck,' he added. 'I taught Romero how to stop penalties, so that hurts.' Match winner: Argentina keeper Romero celebrates at the end of the shootout, in which he made two saves . Manchester City's Sergio Aguero scored one of Argentina's penalties after returning from injury as a substitute. He is now expected to start on Sunday. Coach Alejandro Sabella must now prepare for Germany and said: 'Germany are always a very difficult hurdle to overcome. 'It'll be difficult playing them, and it's an additional hurdle that they've had the extra day and, indeed, could rein themselves in for the second half against Brazil.' Contrasting emotions: Holland goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen buries his head in his hands as Argentina celebrate in the background . Holland, meanwhile, will face Brazil in a third-placed play-off game on Saturday, Van Gaal's last game before being unveiled at United next week. 'I think this match should never be played,' said Van Gaal. 'I've been saying that for 10 years. 'If you lose twice in a row and you look back on a tournament where you've played so marvellously but you leave as a loser after losing the last two matches.'","Defender Ron Vlaar surprisingly stepped up to take first kick and missed .

"Challenger? Liz Kendall, a favourite of Labour's Blairite wing, is widely tipped as a future Labour leader if Ed Miliband slumps to defeat in May . Blairite MP Liz Kendall is being widely tipped as a future Labour leader if Ed Miliband slumps to defeat in May, it emerged yesterday. The Leicester West MP is a member of a ‘breakfast club’ quartet of frontbenchers along with shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds, and shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt. All four were elected in 2010 and have been meeting in Portcullis House before meetings of Mr Miliband’s shadow cabinet. Many MPs from the 2010 intake are keen to move on from the Blair/Brown wars of the past if Labour doesn’t win in May. A clean break from the past would see one of their number challenging for the leadership against several former ministers. Other challengers are likely to include Andy Burnham, the party’s shadow health secretary who made what was widely seen as the best speech at Labour conference last year. Mr Burnham’s popularity among party members has surged on the back of his passionate campaign to protect the NHS from further privatisation. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper is also widely seen as a potential candidate in the event of a Labour loss. Her husband, shadow chancellor Ed Balls, stood for the leadership in 2010 but lost heavily. Yesterday the Independent on Sunday reported Miss Kendall, a Leicester MP, had emerged as the favourite among Blairites impressed by her TV performances. It was also suggested that the quartet of Blairites will unite to try and block Mr Burnham, and suggested Mr Umunna would also be a likely candidate. Other Labour MPs are said to prefer the prospect of a joint ticket involving Mr Hunt and shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves. Last week Miss Kendall raised eyebrows by challenging Mr Miliband’s position on the private sector providing free NHS services, declaring: ‘What matters is what works’. Her tone was markedly different from that of both Mr Miliband and Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham. Miss Kendall, 43, also defended middle-class voters with ‘sharp elbows’ who demand the best from public services. She said: ‘I don’t think there’s anything wrong with making sure that our NHS needs to meet the needs and demands of middle class people or anybody else.’ 'Breakfast club': Miss Kendall is a member of a quartet of Blairite MPs along with, from left, education spokesman Tristram Hunt, business spokesman Chuka Umunna, housing spokesman Emma Reynolds . Mr Miliband has accused the Government of ‘privatising and fragmenting the NHS’, while Mr Burnham has called for a moratorium on new contracts being signed. But in an interview with political magazine The House, Miss Kendall insisted: ‘There will remain a role for the private and voluntary sectors where they can add extra capacity to the NHS or challenges to the system. I believe what matters is what works.’","Leicester West MP was only elected to the Commons in 2010 .

"(CNN) -- Chechen rebel leader Dokku Umarov claimed that he personally gave orders to attack the Moscow subway this week, according to a Chechen rebel Web site. Kavkaz Center, a Web site that regularly carries messages from the rebels, released a video in which Umarov said he was behind the Monday attacks. The attacks were revenge for what Umarov called a ""massacre conducted by the Russian occupants against the poorest residents of Chechnya and Ingushetia,"" the Web site says. According to the site, the video was taped the same day as the attacks. The incident Umarov referred to is a February special operation by Russian forces, after which there were accusations of Russians killing innocent civilians. In the video, Umarov said the victims were simply gathering garlic to make a living. According to Russian officials, at least four civilians were killed during the special operation near the Ingushetian village of Arshty on February 11. After investigating the incident, the officials admitted that it was ""the season to collect wild garlic"" and civilians may have been doing just that despite requests for ""evacuation"" from the area. The president of Ingushetia, Yunus-Bek Evkurov expressed condolences to relatives of the deceased and provided material support in the amount of 50 thousand rubles (about $1,700) for each family. The president noted that during the raid 18 militants were also killed. The attacks in Moscow, in which two female suicide bombers killed at least 39 people and wounded more than 60 others, were legitimate retribution for what happened in Chechnya, Umarov said in the video. He also promised ""new acts of vengeance"" in Russia. Russians will no longer be able to simply observe the battles in the Caucasus, Umarov said. ""Therefore, the war will come to your streets, and you will feel it for yourselves and with your own lives,"" he said in the video. Monday's blasts tore through the Lubyanka and Park Kultury stations in central Moscow -- the female bombers detonating their explosives about 40 minutes apart, starting just before 8 a.m. (12 a.m. ET). On Tuesday, Russian police released photographs of the two women suspected of carrying out the attacks. Special services were also seeking three suspected accomplices of the bombers, Russian state TV reported, citing Moscow police spokesman Viktor Biryukov. They were hunting for a 30-year-old man from the Northern Caucasus who was seen on security cameras wearing dark clothes and a black baseball cap, and two women, aged 22 and 45, both ethnic Slavs, who allegedly assisted the man, state TV reported. ""Our preliminary assessment is that this act of terror was committed by a terrorist group from the North Caucasus region,"" said Alexander Bortnikov of the Federal Security Service, in reference to the investigation at one of the blast sites. The current round of the Russia-Chechnya conflict dates back nearly 20 years, with Chechens having laid claim to land in the Caucasus Mountains region. Thousands have been killed and 500,000 Chechen people have been displaced by the fighting. Chechnya is located in the North Caucasus region of Russia between the Black and Caspian seas.","Chechen rebel leader claims he ordered attack on Moscow subway .

A newlywed couple had their wedding day ruined when police interrupted them while they were dancing and told them that their house had been burgled. It turned out that the culprit was a relative who was not invited to the ceremony and decided to take advantage of the fact that no one would be at the house. Annwen and Jonathan Bell were shocked to hear that their home had been ransacked - but decided to carry on with the party so as not to spoil it for their 200 guests. Couple: Jonathan and Annwen Bell had their wedding day ruined by a burglary at their home . Special day: But the couple were shocked to discover that their home had been broken into . Burglar: Ceri Davis was sentenced to three years and four months in jail over the theft . When they returned to the house in Lampeter, West Wales, they found that their furniture had been slashed and treasured belongings broken, with the damage adding up to £5,000. The couple had spent two years planning their wedding - which featured five bridesmaids, two flower girls and a six-tier cake - after Mr Bell, 34, proposed outside Buckingham Palace. Ceri Davies, whose mother is the girlfriend of Mrs Bell's father, has been jailed for three years and four months after admitting burglary and criminal damage. He was seen breaking into the couple's bungalow by neighbours, who raised the alarm and called police. Wedded bliss: The couple spent two years planning their wedding after Mr Bell proposed outside Buckingham Palace . Joy: But the wedding was interrupted by the arrival of police officers after the burglary . Davies, 26, denied that the theft was 'spiteful' revenge for a family row when he was sentenced at Swansea Crown Court. Mrs Bell's father left his wife of 30 years to start a relationship with the defendant's mother Jill Davies, who had been a lodger with the family. Prosecutor Jackie Lis said: 'The burglary was a particularly nasty offence which saw wanton destruction in the home. 'Davies slashed leather furniture and smashed electrical items and fittings.' Bride: Mrs Bell said that the incident had marred her big day but she still has happy memories of the wedding . Damage: The couple's belongings were smashed up and their carpet was ruined . Speaking after the hearing, Mrs Bell, 30, said: 'The sofas had been slashed, all our TVs smashed, and sentimental ornaments broken into tiny pieces. 'Jonathan's laptop had been destroyed and a bottle of sherry had been tipped over the carpet. 'I was heartbroken - we had gone from absolute bliss at our wedding to find our home had been wrecked out of spite.' Home: The bungalow in Lampeter, West Wales was targeted by Davies when he knew the couple were out . Destruction: The couple were forced to spend £5,000 to repair the damage to their home . The sales assistant added: 'Everyone had wished us well on our wedding day. But on our first day of our married life together our home had been broken into and £5,000 of damage caused. 'Jonathan had to completely re-decorate our bedroom - I just couldn't sleep in it knowing some stranger had been through all my personal belongings.

"(CNN) -- She cuts an imposing figure on the tennis court, but Serena Williams has been stepping gingerly as she prepares to back up her stellar 2013 season. The world No. 1 has arrived in Brisbane to begin her preparations for next month's Australian Open, and she is wary of repeating the successive ankle injuries which have marred her last two campaigns Down Under. The first struck in the Queensland warm-up event two years ago, and then again last January in the opening match in Melbourne -- a factor which contributed to the American's shock fourth-round defeat by then teenager Sloane Stephens. ""I thought about it (at home in Florida during the off season) because I have steps in my room,"" Williams told reporters on Sunday. ""I thought, 'Gosh, I'm going to tip over these steps. I'm going to tape my ankles extra tight for the next four weeks.' ""If I can get a year without twisting my ankle I think I'll be good to go."" Williams overcame both injuries to end 2012 and 2013 as the dominant force in women's tennis, taking her grand slam haul to 17 titles -- five short of Steffi Graf's record. Williams' first opponent in Brisbane will be former world No. 9 Andrea Petkovic, who defeated American Bethanie Mattek-Sands 6-4 7-5 in Sunday's opening round. Only four players beat Williams in 82 matches last season, and the German lost their only previous encounter. The Brisbane event will also feature world No. 2 Victoria Azarenka, who beat Williams in an exhibition in Thailand on Saturday, and Maria Sharapova -- making her WTA Tour comeback from a shoulder injury that has sidelined the Russian since August. Caroline Wozniack, another former world No. 1 who is now working with Sharapova's ex-coach Thomas Hogstedt, has been forced to pull out due to her own shoulder problem but expects to be fit for the following tournament in Sydney. ""Everyone, when they play me, they play pretty much amazing, really unbelievable,"" Williams said. ""I always have to be ready. I can't stop. I love competing. So for me, it's just about motivating myself and trying to reach new goals."" One of those was relaunching her clothes brand Aneres during her postseason break. ""I was interviewing so many people.

And she says her distinctive style is one which others are keen to copy. Dame Zandra (pictured) has accused Kate Moss of ripping off her feather and triangle print design for the model’s recent Topshop collection . Dame Zandra, 74, has accused Kate Moss of ripping off her feather and triangle print design for the model’s recent Topshop collection. Both garments feature long, flowing sleeves, bohemian strip hemlines and a string-tie neckline. Speaking about Moss’s top, Dame Zandra said: ‘Oh yes, it was a complete knock-off. I just hope that the rest of the world sees it as mine. ’ Her spokesman confirmed: ‘It was first used on a dress in 1971 and we used it again in 2003.’ A spokesman for Topshop said: ‘Topshop takes any allegation of intellectual property right infringement extremely seriously.’ Dame Zandra, who received a CBE in 1997, said after yesterday’s ceremony that she had not known the Duchess of Cambridge is pregnant. ‘I’ve been in LA and so busy with my collection that I haven’t paid it any attention, but I will now,’ she said.

"(CNN) -- China's Li Na set up an intriguing final against defending champion Victoria Azarenka at the Australian Open after a comprehensive victory Thursday over world No. 2  Maria Sharapova. The sixth seed -- a beaten finalist in 2011 -- was in imperious form as she romped to 6-2 6-2 win over the Russian in just over an hour and a half. The 30-year old broke Sharapova's serve three times in the opening set and twice in the second to book her place in Saturday's final in Melbourne. ""Every time I'm back in Australia, I always feel something here,"" Li, the first Asian female to win a grand slam singles title, told reporters after the match. ""I always play well here. Everyone can be nervous in a final, so I have to enjoy it. I'm looking forward to the final."" Li credited a brutal training regime after she reached the final four in Melbourne for the third time in four years. She began working with Carlos Rodriguez, former trainer of seven-time grand slam winner Justine Henin, after deciding to end her professional relationship with husband Jiang Shan. ""We train every day for five, six hours, but not only playing tennis,"" she told reporters earlier this week. ""Tennis was like maybe two, three hours. Fitness was for two or three hours as well. First time I was training with him, I was so excited, but after three days, I was dying."" Li said ending her tennis partnership with her husband had caused many people to think they had also ended their personal relationship. ""He was doing a very good job,"" she said. ""But between husband and the coach, it is very tough. Sometimes, if he said 'we should do something' I was feeling tired ... That's why sometimes we have to fight."" Sharapova had lost just nine games coming into the match, a record for the tournament, but her game fell apart as she served six double-faults and made 32 unforced errors while failing to convert six of seven break points. ""She was certainly much more aggressive than I was, dictating the play. I was always on the defense,"" said Sharapova, who lost to Azarenka in last year's final. ""When I had my opportunities and break points in games that went to deuce, I don't think any of them really went my way today."" In the other semifinal, world No. 1 Azarenka ended the run of American teenager Sloane Stephens -- who famously knocked out one of the tournament favorites, Serena Williams. But the Belorussian was forced to overcome an injury scare on her way to a 6-1 6-4 win over her 19-year-old opponent, who saved five match points and broke back to 5-4 in the second set before Azarenka took a lengthy break for medical treatment. Azarenka raised suspicions of gamesmanship when she suggested in her on-court post-match interview that nerves had got to her. ""I almost did the choke of the year right now,"" she said. ""At 5-3, having so many chances and I couldn't close it out. I was a bit overwhelmed realizing I was one step away from the final. Nerves got into me, for sure."" The 23-year-old clarified her comments at her later press conference. ""I'm telling you honestly that my back was bothering me,"" Azarenka said. ""It took me too long of a time to call the trainer, which was my mistake. I took it to the point where I couldn't breathe, which was causing from my back problem, and I couldn't really figure out what was going on on the court. When the trainer told me that was the rib that was blocking that, my back, that's what happened. ""When you cannot breathe you start to panic. I was really panicking, not because I couldn't convert my match point. That's not the case. I mean, I'm experienced enough to go over those emotions. ""But when you cannot breathe, when something's really blocking you, the stress, that was the stress I was talking about. I just couldn't realize what was going on with me."" Stephens refused to criticize Azarenka, with whom she shares an agent. ""We actually are pretty good friends. I'm sure I'll see her and we'll talk about it,"" Stephens said. She will rise to a career-high 17th in the rankings after her best showing in a grand slam, while her popularity has also grown -- Stephens' following on her Twitter page has rocketed from 17,000 to more than 55,000.","China's Li Na beats Russia's Maria Sharapova in straight sets to reach final .

"His dorky haircut, sweater-vest, puffy smile, squint and braces made him an unexpected online phenomenon - but the real-life 'Bad Luck Brian' is actually a church builder named Kyle. While his image is re-purposed constantly online by anyone wanting to illustrate the depths of incompetence or sheer misfortune, Kyle Craven, 25, quietly works away for the family construction business in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. His high school photo, taken when he was 16, is the visual accompaniment to jokes such as 'Wears bullet-proof vest... gets shot in the face', 'Has a pet rock... it runs away' and 'Hires life coach... benched'. Behind the meme: Kyle Craven, left in his normal life, found a joke yearbook photo (right) turned into a vision of incompetence and misfortune after it found its way online . It has also personally earned its star $20,000 in royalties from big-money ad campaigns in the United States and across the world, the Washington Post reported. The snap shot to fame after a friend uploaded it to the Reddit forum in 2012 and is struck a chord with the other users, and he joined the ranks of others whose images became inexplicably famous and repeated millions of times. Craven explained that he was a class clown and made the photo ridiculous on purpose - he bought the sweater from a thrift store, rubbed his cheeks red before posing then pulled a stupid face. Indeed, the picture was so obviously silly that the school principal wouldn't let it in the final cut of the yearbook. But Craven and a school pal, Ian Davies, took a digital copy of the picture that would eventually secure his fame - though it would take six years for Davies to eventually share it with the world. Lucrative: Exposing himself to mockery worldwide has brought in as much as $20,000 for Craven . 'Famous': Craven, seen here wearing a t-shirt of himself, has found himself less in demand of late - but still gets the occasional call . It made its way to t-shirts, stuffed animals and novelty items sold bu the likes of Wal-Mart and Hot Topic, while companies like Volkswagen, and others as far away as Chile and Poland paid up to use his pictures in their ad campaigns. The deals, which he negotiated himself, made him an estimated $20,000, and Craven tried to capitalize on his internet kudos even further by filming videos about his character. He even traveled to Los Angeles for a 'date' with another meme character - Laina Morris, or Overly Attached Girlfriend. While the two didn't fall in love, the resulting video was watched more than 2million times. But, he told the Post, his fame and profitability had an expiry date. While he first video was viewed 350,000 times, interest waned fast. His latest effort, from December old, has attracted an audience of fewer than 10,000, and his monthly Youtube earnings now rarely breach $100. Now that the internet has turned its attention elsewhere, Craven is left with his job as a project manager for church construction. He recently adopted a dog. He considers the picture 'something to show my grandkids one day' - and in the meantime does everything he can to give Brian one last outing whenever another fan comes calling.","Kyle Craven, 25, posed for purposefully ridiculous yearbook photo aged 16 .

"(CNN) -- A soldier has been detained and charged with murder in Wednesday's shooting death of a civilian employee at Fort Knox, Kentucky, according to a court document and the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command. The soldier, identified in an FBI criminal complaint as Marquinta E. Jacobs, was assigned to the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division. He was captured in Tennessee, where his mother lives. The civilian, who has not been publicly named, was shot several times with a .45-caliber handgun in a parking lot at Fort Knox about 5:40 p.m. Wednesday. He was pronounced dead about an hour later. The victim was shot near Jacobs' pickup truck, and Jacobs fled the scene in the truck, according to the complaint filed by FBI Special Agent Mark A. Coleman. According to Coleman's complaint, Jacobs' wife said Jacobs owns a .45-caliber handgun. She allowed investigators to search the home; they found boxes of ammunition believed to be the same type as that used in the shooting. Jacobs' wife said her husband had come home, left the truck and departed again on a motorcycle. Investigators found the motorcycle early Thursday morning at the home of his mother in Portland, Tennessee, the complaint says. Jacobs was believed to have left his mother's place in a Kia Rondo. He was later apprehended by Portland police and Army Criminal Investigation Command agents, the command said in a press release Thursday afternoon. The shooting occurred outside Fort Knox's Human Resources Command building, prompting officials to lock down the army post for an hour. Chris Grey, a spokesman for the CID, said agents were investigating the incident as ""a domestic issue and not a random act of violence."" Authorities are withholding the name of the victim pending notification of his family.","NEW: Soldier Marquinta E. Jacobs arrested in Tennessee, charged with murder .

"Get ready for a close encounter - of the blurred kind. In recent weeks there have been bizarre claims of alien cities on Mars, hovering saucers and artificially designed rocks. But now a shaky video has shown a UFO floating above the Statue of Liberty - leading some to question if extraterrestrial life has been secretly making its way to Earth. A video posted to YouTube shows a black object floating above the Statue of Liberty in New York (shown in red ring). In the video the object moves across the screen before staying still. It moves at a steady speed across the sky before coming to rest. Some have suggested that it might be an alien UFO . The video, posted to YouTube by Scott Kensington, shows a black orb hovering above the famous landmark in New York. The object makes its way slowly across the screen from right to left before then appearing to remain stationary in the air. And some have speculated that it may be an alien spaceship making its way slowly across the sky. Speaking to MailOnline, Dr Susah Schneider said that the first alien life we find might be a form of artificial intelligence - and it could indicate that humans, too, will one day be more machine than man. ‘If you look at our own civilisation, people are becoming more immersed in computers, and we can already see signs of it in our own culture,' she said. ‘So it looks like the next evolutionary step could be we are post-biological, we are sort of part computer in that people decide to “upload” themselves. ‘It sounds kind of crazy, and I don’t approve of this as a philosopher, but I think the thing is that that’s sort of the pattern a lot of people are starting to notice. ‘Aliens will be vastly older than us, so it looks like they may be sophisticated forms of AI that are far smarter than we are.' ‘Of course, there's always the possibility this was a real UFO sighting,’ reported the Examiner. ‘Silver orb spaceships are the latest trend, along with triangular aircraft performing amazing aeronautical feats. ‘So far, this UFO sighting seems to be the first incident catching a pulsating black orb UFO on video.’ On the video Mr Kensington explained how his wife and sister filmed the UFO while they were visiting New York City. He said the shaking was due to her being ‘freezing from holding the camera for so long with no gloves.’ He continued: ‘She said at first she thought it was a balloon but it stopped all of a sudden and stayed in one place for a while. ‘She also ran out of disc space hence why the footage suddenly stopped. ‘What the hell was this guys. Please tell me someone else got this on video to [sic].’ While the prospect of this being an alien spaceship is alluring, the real answer is almost certainly that it is actually a solar balloon. A solar balloon is a black or dark object that gains buoyancy by being heated by the sun’s radiation. Heat inside the balloon expands as it is heated, causing it to rise as it has a lower density than the surrounding air. Some have suggested that solar balloons could be used to explore Mars quickly and easily some day in the future. But for now they are only used on Earth - sometimes to perform experiments in the sky. While the prospect of this being an alien spaceship is alluring, the real answer is almost certainly that it is actually a solar balloon (pictured). A solar balloon is a black or dark object that gains buoyancy by being heated by the sun’s radiation . UFO expert Nigel Watson explained to the MailOnline that it was indeed most likely a solar balloon or possibly also a drone ‘as it flies on a steady course’. He speculated that it may have been staged, saying it is suspicious because ‘it flies directly behind one of the world’s most famous landmarks.’ And he added: ‘Also the camera suddenly cuts to a wider angle before the UFO re-emerges. ‘It is noteworthy that hoaxers have used helium filled Mylar plastic 'solar balloons' in South America to create mass sightings of UFOs. ‘Solar balloons are cheap to make or purchase, and can be identified because they do not make sudden or erratic movements and travel at a regular speed.’","Video posted to YouTube shows object floating across sky in New York .

"(CNN) -- Far from the sea, a man-made coral reef is taking shape -- and it could change medical operations forever. Step inside the OkCoral lab in Israel's Negev Desert and you'll find row after row of quietly bubbling fish tanks, each containing a precious substance. It is hoped the coral grown in this surreal ""farm,"" could one day be used in bone operations -- encompassing everything from dental implants to spinal procedures. Unlike animal and human bones, coral can't be rejected by the body, say medical experts at the company CoreBone, which manufactures bone replacements from coral. Grown in the lab, this coral is also free from the diseases you might find in the oceanic variety. Start-up science . Assaf Shaham founded the unusual laboratory six years ago at a cost of $2.5 million, with an ambitious vision of tapping into the billion dollar worldwide bone grafting industry. But first he'll need the approval of authorities in the European Union and U.S., with a decision expected next year. The father-of-two's dedication to the business is astounding -- if not a little disconcerting. ""In six years of growing corals, I haven't left these four walls for more than 12 hours -- not even once,"" he said. ""For me, it's 100% learning as I go. I take the mother colony, and I cut off a branch of the coral with a diamond saw. Then I glue it to another base made out of cement."" The delicate ecosystem needs constant care to ensure the water's salinity, temperature, and chemical make-up is perfect -- any variations and the coral could die. The fish swimming around each tank are essentially the ""worker bees"" of the artificial reef. They eat the algae growing on the coral, their feces helps feed the coral, and finally, their movements in the water keep the coral strong. And much like the traditional canary in the coalmine, if the fish die, you know something's not quite right in the water. Clever company? Happily for Shaham, his ambitious experiment appears to be thriving, with coral in the lab growing at ten times the normal rate. Just a small container of the coral costs roughly $5 to $10 to produce, and sells for around $250. One of the biggest benefits of the business is its environmental sustainability. ""We have a constant supply,"" says Ohad Schwartz of company CoreBone. ""We don't have to worry that in several years, harvesting from the sea could be forbidden."" It's a concern they'll never have to think about, when harvesting these remarkable fruits of the desert. Watch: Meet the richest man in Saudi Arabia .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . A controversial fire retardant chemical has been removed from some Powerade sports drinks after being taken out of Gatorade last year. Brominated vegetable oil has been removed from fruit punch and strawberry lemonade flavors in some metro areas, an indication it is being phased out due to consumer pressure. The chemical had been the target of a petition by a Mississippi teenager who questioned why it was being used in a drink marketed toward health-conscious athletes. Taking action: A controversial ingredient, brominated vegetable oil, is being removed from some Powerade sports drinks . The petition on Change.org noted that the ingredient is linked to a flame retardant and is not approved for use in Japan or the European Union. PepsiCo said last year it would drop the ingredient from Gatorade in response to customer feedback. At the time, Coca-Cola declined to say whether it would remove the ingredient from the two flavors of Powerade that contain it as well. Bottles of Powerade in fruit punch and strawberry lemonade flavors being sold in the Detroit, Michigan; Omaha, Nebraska, New York and Washington, D.C. areas no longer list the ingredient as of this week. Other bottles still list it, however, suggesting Coca-Cola may have started phasing it out recently. Representatives for the Atlanta-based company weren't immediately available to provide details on the change. The Food and Drug Administration says brominated vegetable oil is used as a stabilizer for flavoring oils in fruit-flavored drinks. Coca-Cola has said in the past that it uses the ingredient to 'improve stability and prevent certain ingredients from separating.' Already resolved: Gatorade moved last year to remove the chemical from its products . The decision by Coca-Cola to remove brominated vegetable oil from Powerade is just the latest evidence that food makers are coming under pressure for the ingredients they use. While companies stand by the safety of their products, some are making changes in response to the movement toward foods that people believe are natural. Earlier this year, for instance, Subway said it would remove an ingredient dubbed the 'yoga mat chemical' from its breads. The ingredient, azodicarbonamide, is approved for use by the FDA and can be found in a wide variety of breads. The petitioner, Vani Hari of FoodBabe.com, said she targeted Subway because of its image for serving healthy food. Likewise, brominated vegetable oil can also be found in several other drinks. But the Mississippi teenager, Sarah Kavanagh, said she targeted Gatorade and Powerade in petitions because they're designed for athletes, who are likely more concerned about what they're putting into their bodies. As Americans cut back on soda, sports drinks have become more important for Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, which is based in Purchase, New York. Although Coca-Cola has long dominated rival PepsiCo on the soda front, it lags the company in the growing sports drink category. According to the industry tracker Beverage Digest, Gatorade has 64 percent of the sports drink market.","Brominated vegetable oil has been removed from some flavors, but not all .

"(CNN) -- U2 lead singer Bono has been discharged from a German hospital where he was treated for a back injury, concert promoter Live Nation said Tuesday. The band's North American shows have been postponed until next year, Live Nation said. And the group has canceled a planned headline appearance at the Glastonbury Festival in England next month, organizers said on their website. Bono suffered a serious back injury Friday while preparing for the resumption of the band's U.S. tour, the band said, and had emergency surgery. ""Bono suffered severe compression of the sciatic nerve,"" Dr. Muller Wohlfahrt said in a statement provided by the concert promoter. ""On review of his MRI scan, I realized there was a serious tear in the ligament and a herniated disc, and that conservative treatment would not suffice. I recommended Bono have emergency spine surgery with Professor (Joerg Christian) Tonn at Munich's LMU University Hospital on Friday."" Tonn said Bono was in severe pain and had already suffered partial paralysis in his lower leg when he was referred. ""The ligament surrounding the disc had an 8-millimeter tear, and during surgery we discovered fragments of the disc had traveled into the spinal canal,"" Tonn said in the statement. ""This surgery was the only course of treatment for full recovery and to avoid further paralysis."" Tonn said Bono is now ""much better"" and has regained all movement. ""The prognosis is excellent, but to obtain a sustainable result, he must now enter a period of rehabilitation,"" Tonn said. Eight weeks of rehabilitation is considered a minimum, Wohlfahrt said. U2 Manager Paul McGuinness said the band is working with Live Nation to reschedule the tour dates. ""Our biggest and I believe best tour has been interrupted and we're all devastated,"" McGuinness said in the statement. ""For a performer who lives to be on stage, this is more than a blow. He feels robbed of the chance to do what he does best and feels like he has badly let down the band and their audience. Which is of course nonsense. ""His concerns about more than a million ticket buyers whose plans have been turned upside down we all share, but the most important thing right now is that Bono make a full recovery.""

"An iPhone-shaped memorial to Apple founder Steve Jobs has been removed from outside a Russian university campus after current CEO Tim Cook announced that he is gay. The 6ft-high statue had been put up outside a college in St Petersburg in January 2013 by a Russian group of companies called West European Financial Union (ZEFS) to honour Jobs.

"A pair of frisky Louisianans were arrested last week for allegedly engaging in oral sex in a moving vehicle. A Kenner police officer pulled over driver Mario Espinal, 33, and his passenger Arletha Alexander, 46, on New Year's Day after first noticing them driving with no headlights around 10pm. The officer said he then noticed someone's head 'moving in an up and down motion' before the passenger began to 'scramble' back to her seat. Once  at the side of the road, the officer says he found Espinal with his pants hanging down by his knees, reports NOLA.com. Caught: Mario Espinal, 33, and his passenger Arletha Alexander, 46, were arrested New Year's Day after a cop noticed them engaged in oral sex with Espinal behind the wheel of a moving vehicle . In his pants leg was a bulge that turned out to be Espinal's underwear. When questioned, Espinal allegedly came clean to the officer, saying Alexander offered to trade him oral sex for a ride. Alexander, however, demurred. She told the officer that she would never perform such an act on Espinal because, reports NOLA, 'she didn't even know him.' Both were arrested. Espinal was charged with obscenity, prostitution, crimes against nature, driving with no license, failure to obey a police officer, failure to use headlights and having no registration certificate. He was held without bond thanks to an unrelated fugitive charge.

She was born into rock ’n’ roll royalty with Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger and former supermodel Jerry Hall as parents, so it is no surprise that Georgia May is heading for similar success. The genetically blessed 20-year-old famed for her iconic gap-tooth smile made her mark when 26 million people watched her walk the catwalk of the Olympic Closing Ceremony with the world's top supermodels. And her latest campaign is equally as glamorous: modelling quintessentially British designer (and close family friend) Vivienne Westwood's new jewellery line. Georgia May Jagger was destined for success when she was born into a family of rock stars and models . But this isn't the first time the pair have met. In fact, Vivienne designed a custom-made dress for a seven-year-old Georgia May after she threw a tantrum when she saw her mother and sister being dressed by the Dame. But Vivienne insists that both Georgia May and sister Lizzie are down-to-earth girls, and they have their mother to thank for that. Georgia May has modelled for Vivienne Westwood before (L) and has also been an ambassador for Rimmel London . Speaking to Grazia magazine, Vivienne said: 'She [Jerry] brought up the children really well. They're always well-behaved.' Georgia May, who has fronted a campaign for Hudson jeans and is set to work with designer Roberto Cavalli, follows in the footsteps of her sister Lizzie, 28, who began her catwalk career aged 14, and her mother, who recently starred on Strictly Come Dancing. She strutted her stuff before millions of viewers worldwide at the Olympic Closing Ceremony along with Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell . But she maintains that her life isn't as glamorous as it seems. 'People think I wake up every day and have my make-up done. It's really not like that,' she told Grazia. Instead she spends many of her days with best friend and fellow model of the moment Cara Delevingne, but wants us to know there is more to the thick eyebrowed 20-year-old than meets the eye. Georgia May and Cara have become best friends through modelling but she maintains the Cara is just a tomboy who doesn't care about looking pretty . 'Cara's a massive tomboy...And not very fabulous at all! I mean, obviously she is, but I see her in a completely different way. 'I know her as a she really is, which is funny and wearing, oh, some kind of jumpsuit. And making weird faces. She doesn't care about looking pretty. 'I shouldn't be outing her,' she said.

"(CNN) -- French police have released a second photo of the man suspected of shooting a photographer at the daily newspaper Liberation Monday, as their manhunt continues. A gunman shot the 23-year-old assistant photographer twice near the heart with a shotgun in the lobby of the newspaper's offices in Paris. Liberation Publisher Nicolas Demorand told CNN affiliate BFMTV on Monday that the victim was ""a little better"" Tuesday but still in critical condition. Paris prosecutor Francois Molins earlier said he was in intensive care. The gunman fled after the attack, and authorities released photos showing a 5-foot-6 to 5-foot-8 man with a ""European appearance"" and graying hair. He was estimated to be between 35 and 45 years old. Police said he was carrying one or two bags and was wearing a khaki parka or a green pullover, a dark sleeveless vest, green-and-white basketball shoes and a dark cap. On Tuesday, police released another image of the suspect that showed him wearing what appeared to be a red parka, blue T-shirt and pale brown knitted hat. Paris police had no information about the man's motive, and prosecutors issued a plea for witnesses who may have seen a man ""making death threats while carrying a gun,"" according to a statement. The suspect apparently also opened fire in front of Societe Generale towers in Paris, the international bank said on Twitter. There were no injuries in that shooting, and police are investigating, the bank said. Another man told police he was carjacked in the neighborhood of La Defense. The bank's towers are in the same neighborhood. The man said he dropped the assailant off near the Champs-Elysee, the city's main street, according to police. On Friday, a gunman broke into BFMTV, threatening journalists before fleeing. The description of the man at Liberation is similar to that of the man at BFMTV, and the gun used was of similar caliber, police said. But it has not been established that it was the same man.","A gunman shot a photographer at the Paris offices of Liberation newspaper Monday .

"GCSE and A-level examinations could be brought forward for  hundreds of thousands of pupils to avoid a clash with Ramadan under controversial proposals. Teachers and lecturers in England and Wales are pushing for the summer exam timetable to be altered to help Muslim students who will be fasting when they sit papers. School exam boards and universities are considering the radical shake-up from 2016, when the religious period of Ramadan clashes with the exam season. Fast: A girl reads from the Koran on the last Friday of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan (file photo). Muslims across the world abstain from eating and drinking from sunrise to sunset during the period . One option is to hold some exams earlier within the usual May-June exam season. Another is for fasting Muslim students to be eligible for extra marks under ‘special consideration’ rules if they believe their performance has been affected. The holy period in the Islamic calendar, which requires Muslims to fast during daylight hours, starts to fall earlier and earlier in the summer from next year, progressively clashing with the exam season in June. The clash also coincides with Michael Gove’s return to O-level style exams, which are taken at the end of the two-year course rather than at intervals throughout it – making the summer exams the only chance to do well. This month, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers Union (ATL) conference will debate how to ‘minimise the impact’ on Muslim pupils. Barry Lingard, who is on the ATL executive committee, said: ‘The consequences are quite huge, particularly with the return to three-hour exams at the end of the course in the summer. If some of the big vital exams like English and maths could be rescheduled for before Ramadan kicks in, that would certainly be supported by the majority of teachers.’ Ofqual, the exam watchdog, and the Joint Council for Qualifications, which represents the main three exam boards, have met with Muslim groups to discuss the issue. Changes: Suggestions including holding exams in the mornings making it easier for pupils to concentrate . Another suggestion is to run exams in the morning, when pupils are less likely to be hungry and tired, rather than the afternoon. The government-funded Equality Challenge Unit, which advises higher education, said exam time-tables should be overhauled. ‘Institutions should be prepared to consider significant adjustments to their exam schedules and think creatively about assessment methods in order to eliminate disadvantage to particular groups,’ it said. Muslim undergraduates at university are also affected by the clash of dates. At the University of East Anglia in Norwich, they have already been told: ‘Where a student feels that fasting has affected their performance, this should be submitted as an extenuating circumstance.’ But Chris McGovern, a former head teacher and spokesman for the Campaign for Real Education, said children had been coping with exams for decades in many different circumstances. ‘Where there is scope for some flexibility the exam boards should exercise it, but I don’t think it is realistic for a board to rearrange their timetable to fit in with a minority religion, or any religion for that matter,’ he said. ‘If you run exams in the morning because of this, you may be disadvantaging a non-Muslim pupil who then has two exams in one day rather than one.’","Efforts to 'minimise impact' will be debated at ATL conference this month .

The female half of a duo accused of being the 'new Bonnie and Clyde' after a bloody 330-mile crime spree claims she was the victim of a meth-addled 'evil person' who was planning to kill her. Far from being his willing accomplice, Angela Hill says she was kidnapped - 'in a way' - by Logan McFarland and dragged on a trip that ended after a high-speed chase on the interstate. Authorities aren't buying the sob story and have charged Hill, 25 - also known as Angela Attwood - with attempted murder. They allege she shot Rattana Keomanivong in the back of the head during a botched carjacking in West Wendover, Nevada. Angela Hill (left) says she was kidnapped 'in a way' by Logan McFarland (right) and dragged on a 330-mile crime spree . Murdered: Leroy and Dorothy Fullwood were found shot to death in their home. McFarland is charged with their murder . Authorities have charged Hill with attempted murder and allege she shot Rattana Keomanivong (pictured) in the back of the head during a botched carjacking in West Wendover, Nevada . In a jailhouse interview with the Salt . Lake Tribune, Hill sobbed as she said she didn't belong behind bars. However, she would not explain exactly how she was innocent of the . crimes when Ms Keomanjvong reported her as the one who tried to rob her . at gunpoint. 'This is not Bonnie and Clyde,' Hill said. 'People are making me out to be an animal, and I’m not.' Instead, . Hill blamed the deadly cross-country rampage on McFarland, a high . school friend, who she says beat her and threatened to kill her. She says he took methamphetamine as the two drove across three towns and evaded police for five days. Hill showed the Salt Lake Tribune reporter broken teeth she says are the result of being punched in the mouth by McFarland. 'He’s evil. He’s an evil person,' she said. She says she went to visit McFarland on December 31 with a friend, even though she hadn't seen the man in years. One day earlier, police say McFarland broke into the home of Leroy and Dorotha Ann Fullwood, ages 70 and 69, in Mount Pleasant, Utah, and shot them both in the head during a robbery. He has been charged with the elderly couple's murder. According to her story, Hill was not with McFarland during the bloody shootings. After she met McFarland, the pair drove to West Wendover, Nevada, and ambushed Ms Keomanivong in the parking lot of a casino. Both of them were armed, Ms Keomanivong told the High Desert Advocate. The victim told police Hill forced her into her own car and told her to drive. McFarland followed in a car he had allegedly stolen on December 29. Ms Keomanivong eventually fought back, biting Hill in the ear and the neck and forcing her out of the car. The gym owner, who was named West Wendover's strongest woman last year, was shot in the back of the head while fleeing. Police say Hill fired the shot, but she told the Tribune: 'I was not the shooter.' The pair were arrested January 4 on a ranch after being spotted by a plane circling overhead. 'I was the one who waved to the plane,' she said. 'I was so glad when the police came, because I probably would have been dead too.'","Angela Hill claims she was kidnapped... 'in a way'

Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon, the deeply private heiress caught up in the spectacular downfall of former Senator John Edwards' political career, has died at 103. Her longtime personal attorney Alexander Forger said from his office in New York City that Mellon died of natural causes Monday at her 4,000-acre horse farm in Upperville, Virginia. Mellon was long a part of the political scene dating back to the Kennedy White House, but was thrust into the public spotlight as a major donor of the now-disgraced Edwards' failed 2008 presidential bid. Death of an icon: Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon (left), pictured in 1964 with husband Paul Mellon  and stepdaughter Eliza Lloyd, has died at 103-years-old . She was thrust into it the American consciousness after almost a century avoiding it when Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards was indicted in 2011 for using what prosecutors alleged was campaign money, including $750,000 from Mellon, to hide mistress Rielle Hunter and their child during his 2008 campaign. Edwards staffers took to calling her large gifts 'Bunny Money,' and was intended for the Senator's personal use, her lawyer said during a 2011 inquiry into his possible misappropriation of donations, according to the Wall Street Journal. The attorney said Mellon was unaware where the money was funneled, she was never charged with any wrongdoing. She stuck by her man despite the controversy, telling Newsweek in a 2011 interview, calling him a 'great friend' and saying 'he would have been a great president.' A 'great friend': Mellon stuck by former North Carolina Senator John Edwards (left) despite him using money she donated to his failed 2008 presidential campaign to coverup a love child father with Rielle Hunter (right) Her name also found its way onto front pages after former investment adviser Kenneth Starr was sentenced to more than seven years in prison for defrauding clients. Both she and her late husband recommended the con artist to friends, and she expressed regret at being part of their losses, friends told Newsweek. Mellon's wealth first came from Listerine, her grandfather Jordan Lambert invented it. She inherited the fortune long before marrying industrialist-turned-banker Paul Mellon, who inherited his fortune from father Andrew Mellon. One of the wealthiest couples in America at the time of their 1948 marriage, they delved into a life of philanthropy, supporting the arts and other causes. Their wealth brought them famous company including Queen Elizabeth II and husband Prince Phillip, as well as several American politicians including soon-to-be President John F Kennedy and wife Jacqueline Kennedy. Bunny was invited to the White House soon . after JFK won the 1960 election - the new first lady leaned on her for . the tips on interior design and entertaining that became a hallmark of . the Kennedy White House. The last known photograph: A then-90-year-old 'Bunny' Mellon speaking during a January, 2000, open house for the Piedmont Child Care Center, a non-profit child care cente . Bunny and Jackie were such close friends that Mellon chartered the private jet that flew the two women to Martin Luther King Jr.'s funeral after his 1968 assassination. Mellon was also tipped to redesign Rose Garden into the space it is today after decades of neglect, according to the Journal. Her familiarity also led to her being the floral director for JFK's funeral a few years later. All of this came at the cost of husband Paul Mellon having what Newsweek, citing a Washington Post report, called 'a wandering eye.' He carried on multiple affairs during their marriage, to the point she even invited one of his mistresses on a family vacation, according to the Post. In the end, though, she found herself blind and alone with her Virginia horse farm and a team of servants. 'Itâ€™s hard being 100 and blind, she told Newsweek. 'I donâ€™t mind being 100, I can cope with that, but not seeing is very scary.'","Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon died at her Virginia horse farm .

"Learning a language has long been known to boost brainpower. But a new study suggests the effects extend to those who begin from the age of 10 . Learning a second language in early childhood has long been known to boost brainpower . But a new study suggests that the effects extend to those who learn a language from the age of 10 onwards. The research found that people who began learning English in middle childhood showed improvements in the structure of the brain's white matter. These 'higher levels of structural integrity' were in areas responsible for language learning and semantic processing. The findings mirror observations from previous studies that found these improvements in people who learned a second language at a much earlier age. Researchers studied brain scans from 20 people, all around the age of 30, who had lived in Britain for at least 13 months. They had all started learning English as a second language around age 10. Their imaging analyses were compared to 25 people of similar age who spoke only English. 'Everyday handling of more than one language functions as an intensive cognitive stimulation that benefits specific language-related brain structures by preserving their integrity, and therefore it protects them against deterioration in older age,' said the study led by Christos Pliatsikas of the University of Kent School of Psychology. Since previous studies had mostly relied on people who learned two or more languages beginning in infancy, scientists say more research is needed to close in on exactly when these positive brain changes begin to take root. The research follows a similar study in June which found that Learning to speak a second language at any point in your life could help keep your brain sharp as you age, a study suggests.

When he was found, yhe man was not wearing a life jacket, his boat did not have any lights and the only navigational aid in his possession was a street map of Southampton. He had packed himself a bag of food, consisting of baked beans, hotdogs and biscuits, as well as a bag of clothes.

'When we reached the gentleman he didn't want us there, he wanted to carry on his way,' the commercial fisherman said. 'We were not happy leaving him out there. He kept saying 'I am going west'. 'His boat was not properly rigged so he was just getting battered, he was at the mercy of the elements. The 30-year-old was taken to shore, where police and an ambulance crew were waiting. He was taken to A&E . The man had been violently sick when he boarded the RNLI lifeboat. He has seen been given accommodation by a 'well-wisher' 'We said ""if we leave you you will die"". He didn't have a life-jacket, just a buoyancy aid and the vessel didn't . have any lights.'

'He was . obviously suffering from the first signs of hypothermia. He was only . wearing a pack-a-mac jacket and leggings. He was absolutely sodden.' The man boarded the RNLI lifeboat, where he was violently sea sick and 'very, very cold', Mr Dadds added. 'I ended up cuddling him at the back of the boat to keep him warm,' he said.

Meanwhile, the victim's family asked a three-judge panel for a more stringent charge that could have the 24-year-old Dutch national's indictment sent back to the prosecutor's office -- a move that could prompt a delay in his trial, if the court assents -- the Lima, Peru, Superior Court said Monday. Both the accused and the victim's family disagree with the indictment proposed by prosecutor Miriam Riveros Castellares. She is asking the panel to indict Van der Sloot on charges of qualified murder and simple robbery, which carry 28-year and 2-year sentences. He would also make a restitution payment of $73,000 to the victim's family. Attorney Luis Jiminez Navarro and his client, Van der Sloot, did not attend the hearing due to what Navarro described as the massive media interest in the case. But the lawyer did submit his response to a proposed indictment in writing, asking for a simple homicide charge that could carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. He said, too, that his client would confess to this charge. But the attorney for the family of the victim, Stephany Flores, told the three judges that the prosecutor's proposed indictment against Van der Sloot had ""mistakes,"" a news release from the court said. It did not specify what mistakes Edward Alvarez Yrala referred to in his arguments. According to Navarro, Yrala asked the court to charge Van der Sloot with a charge akin to aggravated murder, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. The panel has 15 days to decide on Yrala's request for a new indictment. If a decision is made not to return the indictment to the prosecutor's office, a date will be set for Van der Sloot to stand trial on murder and theft charges, the court said. Flores was found dead in Van der Sloot's hotel room in Lima last year. Police say Van der Sloot took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested a few days later. Three Peruvian drivers who allegedly helped Van der Sloot flee to Chile are also charged in the case. Prosecutors want five-year prison sentences for them and fines of about $1,800. Van der Sloot was once the prime suspect in the disappearance of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway, who vanished while on a graduation trip to the Caribbean island of Aruba. He was arrested twice but never charged in connection with Holloway's disappearance, which remains unsolved. Before he resigned earlier this year as Van der Sloot's lawyer in the Peruvian case, Maximo Altez told In Session his client attacked Flores after she found something on his computer that tied him to Holloway. He gave In Session a copy of a motion he filed asking that Van der Sloot face a lesser charge for a crime of passion. ""My client ... admits having murdered the victim, but not with ferocity, for profit or pleasure, nor any of the other element(s) that make up this murder, but only by violent emotion that overtook him at the time he was attacked by the victim,"" the motion read. Van der Sloot was arrested in June of last year in relation to Flores' death, but was not formally charged until this month. Earlier this month, Flores' family urged prosecutors to file charges, warning that Van der Sloot could be released by December unless the case goes ahead. Under Peruvian law, if a suspect's trial doesn't begin within 18 months of his arrest, he is set free. In Session's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.","NEW: Van der Sloot's lawyer wants a charge that could have a 20-year maximum term .

Not a waste of time: Scientists have suggested that playing the Angry Birds computer game can help productivity . If you thought playing games on your mobile phone while at work was a mindless distraction and waste of time, then think again. In fact, it has been discovered that if you play popular game Angry Birds while at your desk – it could make you smarter and a better worker. Research has suggested that playing such games can make you a more ‘resilient’ employee and help you focus at work. A recent article in the Harvard Business Review (HBR) cited research suggesting that engaging in some activities we think are non-productive - such as small exercises - may be a smart way to spend time, particularly at work. People across the world reportedly spend 300 million minutes a day on Angry Birds, one of the most popular games available on touch-screen smartphones. Indeed, the Prime Minister David Cameron has himself admitted to being an Angry Birds addict. Writing in the HBR, Jane McGonigal, a game designer and author of Reality Is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World, referred to research suggesting these practices can make people better problem solvers, more collaborative, and less likely to give up.

"Andrew Flintoff has been left out of Lancashire's squad for the NatWest Twenty20 Blast Roses match against Yorkshire on Friday. The news capped a disappointing day for Flintoff, who scored just 16 and took two wickets but leaked 39 runs in the second XI T20 defeat by Leicestershire at Arundel.

"It sounds like the Holy Grail for humankind; a technique that could slow down ageing by up to half. Now geneticists in Japan have found a way to achieve just that – albeit in a flower, and not a person. The breakthrough allows bouquets to remain fresh for much longer and could help unravel secrets on how to prevent cell decay in other organisms. Japanese scientists say they have found a way to slow down the ageing process in flowers by up to a half, meaning bouquets could remain fresh for much longer . Researchers at the National Agriculture and Food Research Organisation in Tsukuba, east of Tokyo, said they had found the gene believed to be responsible for the short shelf-life of flowers in one Japanese variety of morning glory. 'Morning glory' is the popular name for hundreds of species of flowering plants whose short-lived blooms usually unfold early in the day and are gone by nightfall. By suppressing the gene – named 'Ephmeral1' – the lifespan of each flower was almost doubled, said Kenichi Shibuya, one of the lead researchers in a study carried out jointly with Kagoshima University in southern Japan. Researchers at the National Agriculture and Food Research Organisation in Tsukuba, east of Tokyo, said they had found the gene believed to be responsible for the short shelf-life of flowers in one Japanese variety of morning glory (pictured) Scientists in Japan suppressed the gene 'Ephmeral1'  to double the lifespan of Morning Glory . Living to the ripe old age of 500 might be a possibility if the science shown to extend worms' lives can be applied to humans, scientists have said. In December, U.S. researchers tweaked two genetic pathways in the tiny lab worm Caenorhabditis elegans and boosted the creature's lifespan by a factor of five.The research raises the prospect of anti-ageing treatments based on genetic interactions, they said. ‘What we have here is a synergistic five-fold increase in lifespan,’ said lead scientist Dr Pankaj Kapahi, from the Buck Institute of Age Research, Novato, California. ‘The two mutations set off a positive feedback loop in specific tissues that amplified lifespan. ‘Basically these worms lived to the human equivalent of 400 to 500 years.’ 'Unmodified flowers started withering 13 hours after they opened, but flowers that had been genetically modified stayed open for 24 hours,' he said. This means the plant has fresh purple flowers alongside the paler blooms from the previous day, he said. 'We have concluded that the gene is linked to petal ageing,' Professor Shibuya told AFP. The finding could lead to developing methods to extend the life of cut flowers, he added. 'It would be unrealistic to modify genes of all kinds of flowers but we can look for other ways to suppress the (target) gene ... such as making cut flowers absorb a solution that prevents the gene from becoming active,' Professor Shibuya said. For some flowers, such as carnations, florists currently use chemicals to inhibit ethylene, a plant hormone which sometimes causes blooms to ripen. But ethylene is not involved in the ageing of some popular flowers, such as lilies, tulips and irises. A gene similar to Ephmeral1 could be responsible for petal ageing in these plants, Professor Shibuya said, meaning the ability to suppress it would extend their life. 'Unmodified flowers (stock image used) started withering 13 hours after they opened, but flowers that had been genetically modified stayed open for 24 hours,' said Kenichi Shibuya, one of the lead researchers in a study carried out jointly with Kagoshima University in southern Japan .","Scientists supressed 'Ephmeral1' gene to slow down ageing by half .

"Tragic: The devastated mother of nine-year-old Aaron Dugmore uploaded the last photo she ever took of her son to Facebook after she sound him hanged at their Birmingham home . A boy of nine who was found hanged is believed to have killed himself after he was ‘bullied for being white’ by an Asian gang at school. Aaron Dugmore – thought to be one of the youngest children in the UK to commit suicide – was discovered in his bedroom after being tormented for months, his parents said. They said Aaron was threatened with a plastic knife by one Asian pupil, who warned him: ‘Next time it will be a real one.’ He was also allegedly told by another pupil that ‘all the white people should be dead’ and he was forced to hide from the bullies in the playground at lunchtime. Aaron’s mother, Kelly-Marie Dugmore, 30, and stepfather Paul Jones, 43, said that despite complaints to the school, nothing was done to stop the bullying. Aaron had recently started in Year Five at Erdington Hall Primary School in Birmingham, a school where 75 per cent of pupils come from ethnic minority backgrounds. According to staff at the school he had already ‘settled in quickly’ with his classmates after he joined the school last September when his family moved nearby. The school, which caters for 450 pupils aged three to 11, received an ‘inadequate’ rating by Ofsted inspectors last year.

'Gone but not forgotten': Friends and family paid tribute to the young schoolboy . His mother said she was convinced the taunts led to her son killing himself. ‘Aaron got on with all the children at . his last school, and for him to have been bullied because of the colour . of his skin makes me feel sick to my stomach,’ she said. Mr Jones said that from Aaron’s first day of joining the school he had noticed a change in him. ‘He became argumentative with his brothers and sisters, which wasn’t like him at all,’ he added. ‘Eventually he told us that he was . being bullied by a group of Asian children at school and had to hide . from them in the playground at lunchtime.’ His mother claimed she went to see the . head teacher of the school several times only to be told: ‘You didn’t . have to come to this school, you chose to come here.’ A neighbour of the . boy’s grandmother  earlier told how ‘he had been targeted by a gang of . older bullies at the school’. She said: ‘They made fun of him because he was the new kid but no one really thought it was any more than playground stuff.’ An inquest was opened at Birmingham Coroner’s Court last week but was adjourned to a date to be fixed.

"(CNN) -- Just did some power lunges. Quads getting huge. Can only speak in fragments. Because my quads are so huge. Quads. Huge. Admit it. Your favorite part of working out is actually telling people that you just worked out, especially when you can filter this information into a completely unrelated conversation. ""Dude, earlier today I swear I saw a pigeon eating a pigeon. It was insane. Happened right when I got out of the gym ... that's where I exercise. My muscles."" Deep down, for some reason, you just want people to know that your morning was spent inside a weight room, sweating, as opposed to, say, inside a bathroom, thumbing through an old Garfield book. Of course, some people don't even try to be coy about their workout brags. Instead, they flat out share their stats and results with the world via social media. And it's the worst. ""Just biked 70 miles. Time for a beer. LOL."" This is unacceptable behavior, and it needs to stop. I would do something about it, myself, but I've got a big run coming up. ""Twenty miles. LOL."" Just kidding. I don't run. It requires pants. However, in Moscow, there's a perfectly good reason for working out in public and letting everyone know without having to be one of those people. Because at the Vystavochnaya subway station, riders can now perform 30 squats in exchange for a free metro ticket. It's all a part of a promotion for the upcoming Winter Olympics in Sochi, and the Russian Olympic Committee is hoping to ""add elements of sport into daily life."" Though, to be fair, this was accomplished many years ago when the two-piece track suit legally became the country's official outfit for business casual. To earn the free metro ticket, which costs about $0.92 American, commuters have two minutes to complete their squats in front of the ticket machine's special counting camera. But you have to do all 30. No fewer. Otherwise, a bear crawls out of the machine and mauls you. In Mother Russia, failure has consequences. But, really, if you fail to do all 30, you just have to pay for your ticket. There's no reward for participation. And squats are no easy task. Right now I'm in week four of the Insanity home workout program -- see how I slipped that in there? -- and it's basically 40 minutes of squats, broken up by short moments of lashing out with profanities toward Shaun T and Tania. I cry during the 30-second rest breaks, and check my e-mail during Level 1 drills. Because ain't nobody got time for that. The point is that squats are hard, and the following activities may prove to be far more satisfying: . 1) Sleeping . 2) Eating . 3) Being trapped in a car fire . Regardless, the squat machine in Moscow will remain at the station until the beginning of December, and the Olympic Committee is planning more chances for people to get fit in public with exercise bikes that charge your phone and bus handles converted into stretchy exercise bands. So, remember Russians, drink your recovery fluid and log onto Team BeachBody dot com. And good luck with that bear.

"(CNN) -- Tomas Berdych has launched a scathing attack on the time limit rule in tennis following his victory against Germany's Tobias Kamke at the Dubai Open Wednesday. The World No.6 is a fierce critic of the new 25-second time rule, which has reduced the permitted pause in between rallies by five seconds. The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), which runs the men's tour, introduced the change at the start of the year in a bid to give umpires greater powers. Czech Berdych, who lost out in the final of the Marseille Open last Sunday, has been warned against time wasting on several occasions in recent weeks. Federer eyes grand slam titles in 2013 . The new rule is supposed to make the game more entertaining for spectators and speed up a sport where the average contest has only 20 minutes of action in an hour. But Berdych, who was clearly suffering with fatigue following his exertions 4,800 kilometers away in France, says the rule needs modifying. ""I don't like it. I'm not a fan of it. I don't see any single reason why to have this rule,"" he told reporters. ""What could be positive on this? What could work? What could be advantage? ""I get like a six or seven (warnings) in Chennai and then I did not get one in Marseille and now I just get only warning. So I'm improving. Tsonga and Ferrer battle to title wins .

Simple as that if they want to go straight."" Berdych clearly struggled to adapt to the heat and wind in the Gulf, saving 12 break points and dropping serve twice before prevailing 7-5 6-1 to make the last eight.

"Washington (CNN) -- Idaho on Wednesday became the first state to pass a law saying no thanks to part of President Obama's health care proposal. The Idaho Health Care Freedom Act says in part, ""every person within the state of Idaho is and shall be free to choose or decline to choose any mode of securing health care services without penalty or threat of penalty."" Gov. C.L. ""Butch"" Otter, a Republican, said Wednesday he signed it because he believes any health care laws should ensure people are ""treated as an individual, rather than as an amorphous mass whose only purpose in this world is to obey federal mandates."" Several other states may follow suit. The governor of Virginia is expected to sign a bill passed in his state last week, and according to American Legislative Exchange Council, similar proposals have made it through one chamber of the legislatures in Missouri, Oklahoma and Tennessee. While such bills have recently failed in six states, 22 additional states have seen proposals introduced. These state laws would directly conflict with the national health care bill that Democrats are trying to pass, which includes a requirement that all individuals get health coverage or face a tax penalty. Several legal analysts said if Congress enacts a national health care law, it would supersede any state laws written to block them. ""I think most of the states that are passing these laws understand that they can't trump federal law with state law,"" said Professor Jonathan Siegel at George Washington University Law School. ""But what they get out of it is symbolic effect. They're sending a message to the federal politicians that they don't like the health care mandate."" Such state laws might not be the only legal challenge to Democratic health care legislation. Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum, a Republican, on Tuesday sent a letter to the other 49 state attorneys general, asking them to join him ""in preparing a legal challenge to the constitutionality of whatever individual mandate provision emerges, immediately upon the legislation becoming law."" States have previously challenged federal laws and regulations in areas aside from health care. Five states have passed a Firearms Freedom Act, according to firearmsfreedomact.com, including Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, Tennessee and Utah. The law declares that any guns that are manufactured and kept in-state are not subject to federal gun laws passed by Congress under interstate commerce authority, because the guns never crossed state lines. A number of states have also passed laws trying to wrest more control from Washington over issues such as how public lands are used or how a state's National Guard forces are deployed overseas, according to the 10th Amendment Center, which advocates for states' rights. While such laws may face an uphill path in court, supporters describe them as a sign of public opinion, which can still have impact. They point to last year's announcement of federal policy on medicinal marijuana, after 14 states passed laws to allow its use. While federal drug law makes no exception to allow medicinal use of marijuana, Attorney General Eric Holder said in October that prosecuting the use of medicinal marijuana users wouldn't be a priority. He said the Justice Department would instead ""effectively focus our resources on serious drug traffickers, while taking into account state and local laws.""
