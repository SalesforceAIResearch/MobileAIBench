Downeast Airlines Flight 46 was a scheduled airline service in the United States from Boston's Logan International Airport to Rockland, Maine operated by Downeast Airlines.  On May 30, 1979 a de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter operating the flight crashed during a nonprecision approach to Rockland's Knox County Regional Airport.  The cause of the accident was controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) after the failure of the flightcrew to stop the aircraft's descent below the minimum descent altitude for the nonprecision approach at Knox County airport.  The investigation into the accident looked into the airline's corporate culture as a contributing factor to the crash; this was the first time an investigation took this approach to an air crash.

Río Cruces originates from hills near the Villarica volcano and flows then in south-west direction.  The southern and final part of the river follows the Valdivian Coastal Range.  At the latitude of Valdivia it is crossed by Río Cruces Bridge near its outflow into Valdivia River.  The small village of Punucapa is the main centre for tourism in Río Cruces.  The river flow through (or near) the cities of Loncoche, Lanco, and Mariquina.  Some of the wetlands in the river's lower flow are inside Carlos Anwandter Nature Sanctuary, a protected area that in the river that extends roughly from Punucapa in the south to San Luis de Alba Fort in the north. A mouth bar is a bar in a river that is typically created in the middle of a channel in a river delta.  It is created by a positive feedback between mid-channel deposition and flow divergence.  As the flow diverges near the ocean, sediment settles out in the channel and creates an incipient mouth bar.  As flow is routed around the incipient bar, additional sediment is deposited on the incipient bar.  This continued process results in the formation of a full-fledged mouth bar, which causes the channel to bifurcate.  This continued process leads to the characteristic fractal tree pattern found in some prograding river-dominated deltas. An antidune is a bedform found in fluvial and other channeled environments.  Antidunes occur in supercritical flow, meaning that the Froude number is greater than 1.0 or the flow velocity exceeds the wave velocity; this is also known as upper flow regime.  In antidunes, sediment is deposited on the upstream (stoss) side and eroded from the downstream (lee) side, opposite lower flow regime bedforms.  As a result, antidunes migrate in an upstream direction, counter to the current flow.  Antidunes are called in-phase bedforms, meaning that the water surface elevation mimics the bed elevation; this is due to the supercritical flow regime.  Antidune bedforms evolve rapidly, growing in amplitude as they migrate upstream.  The resultant wave at the water's surface also increases in amplitude."

He was second son of Sir Thomas Harrington, who had died with the king's father at the Battle of Wakefield in December 1460.  James himself had fought with Salisbury at the Battle of Blore Heath in 1459, where he had been captured and imprisoned by the Lancastrians until the next year.  He was a significant regional figure during the reign of King Edward IV, although the early years of the new king's reign were mared by a bitter feud between him and the Stanley family over a castle in Lancashire.  On the accession of King Richard III in 1485, he was appointed to the new king's Household, and as such was almost certainly with him at Battle of Bosworth two years later.  It is likely that he fell in battle there, although precise details of his death are now unknown.

The Second Arab siege of Constantinople in 717–718 was a combined land and sea offensive by the Muslim Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate against the capital city of the Byzantine Empire, Constantinople.  The campaign marked the culmination of twenty years of attacks and progressive Arab occupation of the Byzantine borderlands, while Byzantine strength was sapped by prolonged internal turmoil.  In 716, after years of preparations, the Arabs, led by Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik, invaded Byzantine Asia Minor.  The Arabs initially hoped to exploit Byzantine civil strife and made common cause with the general Leo III the Isaurian, who had risen up against Emperor Theodosius III.  Leo, however, tricked them and secured the Byzantine throne for himself. In urban sociology, fragmentation refers to the absence or the underdevelopment of connections between the society and the groupings of some members of that society on the lines of a common culture, nationality, race, language, occupation, religion, income level, or other common interests.  This gap between the concerned group and the rest might be social, indicating poor interrelationships among each other; economical based on structural inequalities; institutional in terms of formal and specific political, occupational, educative or associative organizations and/or geographic implying regional or residential concentration.  bell hooks coined the term when addressing the problem of 'hierarchy of oppression' within the feminist movement; where some felt experiencing more types of oppression gave greater validity to one's opinion and, therefore undermined group strength and solidarity within the movement as much as non-interscectional identity did in the 1970s [where female identity was seen predominantly through the lens of white, middle-class women and didn't take into consideration that identity could be made up of many more cultural influences such as race, gender, sexuality, spirituality etc. all intersecting across points of privilege and oppression].  hooks argued for greater inclusivity, mutual support and an understanding of various types of feminism within the movement; each sharing the same equity goals, yet having different ideas on the methods to achieve such goals. The Zanj occupation of al-Ubulla (Arabic: دخول الزنج الأبلة‎ ‎ ) was an event of the Zanj Rebellion, occurring on June 28, 870.  Zanj troops dispatched by their leader 'Ali ibn Muhammad advanced against the city of al-Ubulla on the Tigris and launched an attack against it.  Despite a defense set up by the Abbasid government to protect the city, it was successfully stormed and taken by the rebels.  Much of al-Ubulla was destroyed and many of its inhabitants were killed during the assault.

He was instrumental in numerous revolutionary advances in airline history, including the development and production of the Boeing 314 Clipper, which opened trans-Pacific airline travel, the Boeing Stratocruiser which helped to pioneer cabin pressurization, the Boeing 707 which launched the Jet Age, and the Boeing 747 which introduced the era of jumbo jets (evolved from Air Force bombers, tanker and transport design, respectively).  Trippe's signing of the 747 contract coincided with the 50th anniversary of Boeing, and he gave a speech where he explained his belief that these jets would be a force that would help bring about world peace. The teleological or physico-theological argument, also known as the argument from design, or intelligent design argument is an argument for the existence of God or, more generally, for an intelligent creator ""based on perceived evidence of deliberate design in the natural or physical world"".  It is an argument in natural theology. The Boeing 747SP is a version of the Boeing 747 jet airliner which was designed for ultra-long-range flights.  The ""SP"" stands for ""Special Performance"".  The 747SP is similar to the 747-100 except for the shortened fuselage, larger tailplane, and simplified trailing edge flaps.  The weight saved by the shorter fuselage permits longer range and increased speed relative to other 747 configurations at the time. The Boeing 747 Dreamlifter, also known as the Boeing 747-400 Large Cargo Freighter (LCF), is a wide-body cargo aircraft.  At 65,000 cubic feet (1,840 cubic meters) the cargo hold is the largest in the world for an aircraft.  It can hold three times the volume of a 747-400F freighter.  Cargo is placed in the aircraft by the world's longest cargo loader.  It is an extensively modified Boeing 747-400 that is used exclusively for transporting Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft components to Boeing's assembly plants from suppliers around the world. The Boeing 747-400 is an improvement of the 747-300, and is the best-selling model of the Boeing 747 family of jet airliners.  While retaining the four-engine wide-body layout of its predecessors, the 747-400 embodies numerous technological and structural changes to produce a more efficient airframe.  Its most distinguishing features versus preceding 747 models are 6 ft winglets mounted on 6 ft wing tip extensions, which are found on all 747-400s except for Japanese domestic market versions.

Aaron Copland ( ; November 14, 1900December 2, 1990) was an American composer, composition teacher, writer, and later a conductor of his own and other American music.  Copland was referred to by his peers and critics as ""the Dean of American Composers.""  The open, slowly changing harmonies in much of his music are typical of what many people consider to be the sound of American music, evoking the vast American landscape and pioneer spirit.  He is best known for the works he wrote in the 1930s and 1940s in a deliberately accessible style often referred to as ""populist"" and which the composer labeled his ""vernacular"" style.  Works in this vein include the ballets ""Appalachian Spring"", ""Billy the Kid"" and ""Rodeo"", his ""Fanfare for the Common Man"" and Third Symphony.  In addition to his ballets and orchestral works, he produced music in many other genres including chamber music, vocal works, opera and film scores."

The two exceptions to this order are made for teams that appeared in the previous Super Bowl; the Super Bowl champion always picks 32nd, and the Super Bowl loser always picks 31st.  Teams have the option of trading away their picks to other teams for different picks, players, cash, or a combination thereof.  Thus, it is not uncommon for a team's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick, or for a team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these trades.

In March of 1887, Frank Lloyd Wright, having newly moved to Chicago to try to become an architect, received a letter from his aunt Ellen C. Lloyd Jones asking him to perhaps design a building for the school that she planned with her sister, Jane (""Jenny"").  Biographer Meryle Secrest wrote about the letter from ""Aunt 'Nell'"" to Wright in her biography on the architect: The letter contains detailed instructions about floor plans... She added that some of her friends were contributing their architectural notions.  The nephew seems to have cut them all out fast.  His resulting designs were evidently derived from those of [Joseph Lyman] Silsbee [his then-employer], and one of his authorized biographies more or less acknowledges that this architect played the largest role.  Wright dismissed his first attempt as ""amateurish.""  Nell Lloyd Jones asked her nephew to design this structure because she and Jenny were planning on beginning the Hillside Home School on land left to them by their father, in the town of Wyoming, Wisconsin (south of the town of Spring Green).  This building, which became known as the ""Home Building"", was the first one designed specifically by Wright for the school, a coeducational day and boarding school which functioned until 1915.  Silsbee had introduced the young Wright to the ""Shingle Style mixture of Queen Anne and Colonial elements.""  In 1907, Spring Green's newspaper, the ""Weekly Home News"", ran an article focused on the Hillside Home School institution, then in its twentieth year.  In the section about the home building, the article stated that it:[C]ontains the parlors, in one of which there is a beautiful carved fireplace which at once attracts the attention of the visitor….  This building also contains the dining rooms, living rooms and kitchens, which are all modern and well-equipped.  Besides these are twenty-two rooms which are occupied by the girls and some of the teachers.  They are all large, well ventilated and sunny.  The architecture of this building is English.The Home Building was the first of three structures that Wright would design for the Hillside Home School.  In addition to the 1887 design, he was commissioned to design the Romeo and Juliet Windmill in 1896 and the Hillside Home School in 1901 (often referred to as Hillside Home School II to differentiate it from the 1887 structure). The Barber-Pittman House at 416 N. Ashley St. in Valdosta, Georgia was built in 1915.  It was a work of architect Lloyd Barton Greer."

Gastronomy is the study of the relationship between food and culture, art of preparing and serving rich or delicate and appetizing food, a style of cooking of particular region, and the science of good eating.  One who is well versed in gastronomy is called a gastronome, while a gastronomist is one who unites theory and practice in the study of gastronomy.  Practical gastronomy is associated with the practice and study of the preparation, production, and service of the various foods and beverages, from countries around the world.  Theoretical gastronomy supports practical gastronomy.  It is related with a system and process approach, focused on recipes and cookery books.  Food gastronomy is connected with food and beverages and their genesis.  Technical gastronomy underpins practical gastronomy, introducing a rigorous approach to evaluation of gastronomic topics. Alcohol, also known by its chemical name ethanol, is a psychoactive drug found as the active ingredient in alcoholic beverages such as beer, wine, and distilled spirits.  It is one of the oldest and most common recreational drugs, causing the characteristic effects of alcohol intoxication or ""drunkenness"".  Among other effects, alcohol produces euphoria, decreased anxiety, increased sociability, sedation, impairment of cognition, memory, and motor function, and generalized depression of central nervous system function.  Ethanol is the only type of alcohol that is found in alcoholic beverages and is commonly used for recreational purposes; other alcohols such as methanol and isopropyl alcohol are toxic and potentially lethal. The Anunnaki (also transcribed as Anunaki, Anunna, Ananaki, and other variations) are a group of deities that appear in the mythological traditions of the ancient Sumerians, Akkadians, Assyrians, and Babylonians.  Descriptions of how many Anunnaki there were and what role they fulfilled are inconsistent and often contradictory.  In the earliest Sumerian writings about them, which come from the Post-Akkadian period, the Anunnaki are the most powerful deities in the pantheon, descendants of An, the god of the heavens, and their primary function is to decree the fates of humanity.  In ""Inanna's Descent into the Netherworld"", the Anunnaki are portrayed as seven judges who sit before the throne of Ereshkigal in the Underworld.  Later Akkadian texts, such as ""The Epic of Gilgamesh"", follow this portrayal.  During the Old Babylonian period, the Anunnaki were believed to be the chthonic deities of the Underworld, while the gods of the heavens were known as the Igigi. Thomistic sacramental theology is St. Thomas Aquinas's theology of the sacraments of the Catholic Church.  It can be found through his writings in the ""Summa contra Gentiles"" and in the ""Summa Theologiæ""."

Its mission statement is to ""sign bands that go against what you believe to be cool.""  The most prominent and active bands amongst the Tarantulas (besides the Explosion) were The Distillers, The Bronx, The Static Age, and Darker My Love.  At its height, Tarantulas became less a label and more a movement of people across the US sick of what was happening to music and counterculture—a number of non-musicians (for lack of a better term, fans) identified themselves as Tarantulas, many tattooing themselves with the label logo—and bands turned down other, much bigger labels, to be a part of the group.  Unfortunately, the label/collective ceased to be in 2005/2006 due to disagreements with distributor The Platform Group (a link to Fontana) and other tensions (many rumors and myths persist about all sorts of clashes around this time, centering on 2005 in Silver Lake, LA), but a couple of the label's main bands at the time continued on to other labels and situations, namely The Static Age and Darker My Love.

The first set of wind turbines installed were of American-made Storm Master brand, however they proved troublesome and eventually had to be replaced.  Dehlsen quickly turned to Danish-built machines later, thus comprising the majority of the turbines at the pass.The area hosts a multitude of wind farms, comprising one of California's largest wind resource areas.  The pass is undergoing much repowering activity.  The area has multiple generations of wind turbine technology installed, including both single and double-blade turbines, as well as the more modern three-blade horizontal axis design.  The older generation turbines generate kilowatts, and the modern turbines installed generate up to 3 megawatts, depending on the specific turbine and manufacturer.  The Tehachapi wind resource area is a net exporter of generation to other parts of the state of California.  A state initiative to upgrade the transmission out of Tehachapi (Tehachapi Renewable Transmission Project) began in 2008 and was expected to be completed by 2012.  This has opened the door to further regional wind power development and multiple projects are expected to be installed to utilize that capacity.  A prime location for viewing the turbines is off of State Route 58 and from Tehachapi-Willow Springs Road. Suntrust v. Houghton Mifflin Co., 252 F. 3d 1165 (11th Cir."

The classification is based on similarities at the tertiary and primary structural levels.  Comparisons are restricted to that part of the sequence directly involved in the reaction, which in the case of a peptidase must include the active site, and for a protein inhibitor the reactive site.  The classification is hierarchical: sequences are assembled into families, and families are assembled into clans.  A family is assembled around a ""type example"", the sequence of a well-characterized peptidase or inhibitor.  All other sequences in the family must be related to the family type example, either directly or through a transitive relationship involving one or more sequences already shown to be family members.  Typically, FastA or BlastP are used to establish sequence relationships, with an expect value of 0.001 or lower taken to be statistically significant.  A clan is also assembled around a type example, this being the structure of a well-characterized peptidase or inhibitor.  A family is included in a clan if the tertiary structure of a family member can be shown to be related to that of the clan type example.  Typically, DALI is used to establish clan membership, with a z score of 6.00 standard deviation units or above considered to be statistically significant.  For peptidases, other evidence to indicate that families are related when a tertiary structure is absent includes the same order of catalytic residues in the sequences.

His prior clubs included Belgian Pro League team Lokeren and Belgian Second Division team OH Leuven. The Homegrown Player Rule has been an initiative in England and the Premier League to allow for more domestic, English players to be a brought up from a younger age in hopes of creating more talented English players.  Currently, the Premier League does not have a maximum restriction on the number of foreign players allowed on a team, but does require at least eight homegrown players.  Greg Dyke, new chairman of the Football Association (FA), wants to implement much stronger regulation of foreign players.  His intention is clear as stated in an op-ed piece so that England can win the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.  Some of Dyke’s propositions include: homegrown players in a top-flight 25-man first-team squad be increased from eight to 12 two of which must be brought up in the teams youth system, and also changing the definition of what it is to be a homegrown player.  Currently, to be classified as homegrown one must be on an English team for at least three years before the age of twenty-one in which Dyke would like to reduce to eighteen years.  This would mean a teenager would have to be with the club at a maximum age of fifteen and players are not allowed to move across national boundaries, even European Union boundaries, before 16.  Meaning such that, if a foreign player joined an English youth academy at sixteen, in three years time he would be nineteen.  Thus said player failing to qualify as a homegrown player due to the fact he would be older than eighteen.  This has become such a hot topic is because there are currently a group of players who have played 309 international games between them but none of them for England.  While there is currently a list of foreign players, to show the disparity of homegrown players versus foreign players on any given team, the below picture will illustrate such ideas, SkySports hosts an image detailing the number of homegrown players in each Premier League team.

As a disciple of Ulugh Beg, he is best known for the development of astronomical physics independent from natural philosophy, and for providing empirical evidence for the Earth's rotation in his treatise, ""Concerning the Supposed Dependence of Astronomy upon Philosophy"".  In addition to his contributions to Ulugh Beg's famous work Zij-i-Sultani and to the founding of Sahn-ı Seman Medrese, one of the first centers for the study of various traditional Islamic sciences in the Ottoman caliphate, Ali Kuşçu was also the author of several scientific works and textbooks on astronomy. Mīrzā Muhammad Tāraghay bin Shāhrukh (Chagatai: میرزا محمد طارق بن شاہ رخ , Persian: میرزا محمد تراغای بن شاہ رخ‎ ‎ ), better known as Ulugh Beg () (March 22, 1394 in Sultaniyeh, Persia – October 27, 1449, Samarkand), was a Timurid ruler as well as an astronomer, mathematician and sultan.  His commonly known name is not truly a personal name, but rather a moniker, which can be loosely translated as ""Great Ruler"" or ""Patriarch Ruler"" and was the Turkic equivalent of Timur's Perso-Arabic title ""Amīr-e Kabīr"".  His real name was ""Mīrzā Mohammad Tāraghay bin Shāhrukh"".  Ulugh Beg was also notable for his work in astronomy-related mathematics, such as trigonometry and spherical geometry.  He built the great Ulugh Beg Observatory in Samarkand between 1424 and 1429.  It was considered by scholars to have been one of the finest observatories in the Islamic world at the time and the largest in Central Asia.  He built the Ulugh Beg Madrasah (1417–1420) in Samarkand and Bukhara, transforming the cities into cultural centers of learning in Central Asia.  He was also a mathematician of the 15th century — albeit his mental aptitude was perseverance rather than any unusual endowment of intellect.  His observatory is situated in Samarkand which is in Uzbekistan.  He ruled Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, southern Kazakhstan and most of Afghanistan from 1411 to 1449. Samarkand (Uzbek: ""Samarqand"" ; Persian: سمرقند‎ ‎ ; Cyrillic/Russian: ""Самарканд"" ), alternatively Samarqand or Samarcand, is a city in modern-day Uzbekistan and is one of the oldest inhabited cities in Central Asia.  There is evidence of human activity in the area of the city from the late Paleolithic era, though there is no direct evidence of when exactly Samarkand was founded; some theories indicate that it was founded between the 8th and 7th centuries BC.  Prospering from its location on the Silk Road between China and the Mediterranean, at times Samarkand was one of the greatest cities of Central Asia. Transoxiana (also spelled Transoxania), known in Arabic sources as Mā warāʼ al-Nahr (Arabic: ما وراء النهر‎ ‎ ] – 'what [is] beyond the [Oxus] river') and in Persian as Farārūd (Persian: فرارود‎ ‎ , ] —'beyond the [Amudarya] river'), is the ancient name used for the portion of Central Asia corresponding approximately with modern-day Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, southern Kyrgyzstan, and southwest Kazakhstan.  Geographically, it is the region between the Amu Darya (Ancient Greek: Ώξος ""Ốxos"") and Syr Darya rivers.  The area had been known to the Romans as Transoxania (Land beyond the Oxus), to the Arabs as Mawarannahr (Land Beyond the River), and to the Iranians as Turan, a term used in the Persian national epic Shahnameh. The Emirate of Bukhara (Persian: امارت بخارا‎ ‎ ; Uzbek: Buxoro amirligi ) was a Central Asian state that existed from 1785 to 1920, which is now modern-day Uzbekistan."

The incident took place on November 20, 2004 at the Memorial Stadium in Clemson, South Carolina.  This disturbance led to serious repercussions handed down for those involved from the SEC (South Carolina's conference) and the ACC (Clemson's conference).  This took place the day after a notable brawl at an NBA game in Detroit,"" the ""Malice at the Palace"". In basketball, a technical foul (also colloquially known as a ""T"" or a ""Tech"") is any infraction of the rules penalized as a foul which does not involve physical contact during the course of play between opposing players on the court, or is a foul by a non-player.  The most common technical foul is for unsportsmanlike conduct.  Technical fouls can be assessed against players, bench personnel, the entire team (often called a bench technical), or even the crowd.  These fouls, and their penalties, are more serious than a personal foul, but not necessarily as serious as a flagrant foul (an ejectable offense in leagues below the NBA, and potentially so in the NBA). In the sport of basketball, the bonus situation (also called the penalty situation) occurs when one team accumulates a requisite number of fouls, which number varies depending on the level of play.  When one team has committed the requisite number of fouls, each subsequent foul results in the opposing team's taking free throws regardless of the type of foul committed (i.e., whether the foul was a shooting foul).  Teams under the limit are commonly referred to as having fouls to give, and thus they can try to disrupt their opponents without being penalized free throws.

A backboard shattering is an accident or stunt in basketball.  It occurs when a player slam dunks the ball hard enough to break the 1/2"" tempered safety glass of the backboard.  The stunt has caused games to be canceled or delayed, serious injuries to occur and expensive costs of cleanup and replacement.  Shattering a backboard is extremely dangerous, sending shards of glass flying over the players and fans.  In the National Basketball Association (NBA), shattering a backboard during a game is penalized with a non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul and a possible fine towards the player."

Kress of the National Audubon Society to learn how to restore puffins to historic nesting islands in the Gulf of Maine.

The project began with an attempt to restore puffins to Eastern Egg Rock Island in Muscongus Bay, about 6 mi away from Pemaquid Point.  The restoration efforts are based on the fact that young puffins usually return to breed on the same island where they hatched. Seal Island is a small land mass located 5.7 km off the northern beaches of False Bay, near Cape Town, in South Africa.  The island is so named because of the great number of Cape fur seals that occupy it.  It is 5 acre in area and home to 64,000 cape fur seals.  It is home to seabirds too and it is likely that non-marine species (in no great number) fly there to breed as well (see external link to the Avian Demographic Unit at the University of Cape Town).  The island is an outcrop of the Cape granite and rises no more than about four to six metres above the high tide mark.  The island is long and narrow- 800 metres by 50 metres.

Article 10 of the Constitution of Malaysia guarantees Malaysian citizens the right to freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of association.  Unlike comparable provisions in constitutional law such as the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, Article 10 entitles citizens to such freedoms as are not restricted by the government, instead of absolutely guaranteeing those freedoms. The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and the freedom to practice all religious rites provided that the public order is not disturbed.  The Constitution declares equality of rights and duties for all citizens without discrimination or preference but establishes a balance of power among the major religious groups.  The Government generally respected these rights; however, there were some restrictions, and the constitutional provision for apportioning political offices according to religious affiliation may be viewed as inherently discriminatory.  There were no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice.  There were, however, periodic reports of tension between religious groups, attributable to competition for political power, and citizens continued to struggle with the legacy of a 15-year civil war that was fought largely along sectarian lines.  Despite sectarian tensions caused by the competition for political power, churches, mosques, and other places of worship continued to exist side-by-side, extending a centuries-long national heritage as a place of refuge for those fleeing religious intolerance. Citizens for Constitutional Freedom (C4CF), later also known as People for Constitutional Freedom (P4CF), was the name taken on January 4, 2016, by an armed private U.S. militia that occupied the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Malheur National Wildlife Refuge headquarters in the U.S. state of Oregon from January 2 to February 11, 2016.  The leader of the organization was Ammon Bundy, son of Cliven D. Bundy, who engaged in a standoff with the federal government over grazing rights on federal land. Ammon Edward Bundy (born September 1, 1975) is an American car fleet manager who led armed militants in the 2016 occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. According to the U.S. Department of State's annual report on human rights in Mali for 2003, Mali's government generally respects the human rights of its citizens and observes relevant constitutional provisions (e.g., freedom of speech and of the press, freedom of assembly and association, freedom of religion) and prohibitions (e.g., arbitrary arrest and detention, forced exile, torture, and discrimination based on race, sex, disability, language, or social status). Fundamental Rights are the basic rights of the people and the charter of rights contained in of Constitution of India.  It guarantees civil liberties such that all Indians can lead their lives in peace and harmony as citizens of India.  These include individual rights common to most liberal democracies, such as equality before law, freedom of speech and expression, religious and cultural freedom and peaceful assembly, freedom to practice religion, and the right to constitutional remedies for the protection of civil rights by means of writs such as habeas corpus, Mandamus, Prohibition, Certiorariand Quo Warranto.  Violation of these rights result in punishments as prescribed in the Indian Penal Code or other special laws, subject to discretion of the judiciary.  The Fundamental Rights are defined as basic human freedoms that every Indian citizen has the right to enjoy for a proper and harmonious development of personality.  These rights universally apply to all citizens, irrespective of race, place of birth, religion, caste or gender.

Different traditions mark the date of Twelfth Night on either 5 January or 6 January; the Church of England, Mother Church of the Anglican Communion, celebrates Twelfth Night on the 5th and ""refers to the night before Epiphany, the day when the nativity story tells us that the wise men visited the infant Jesus"".  In Western Church traditions, the Twelfth Night concludes the Twelve Days of Christmas; although, in others, the Twelfth Night can precede the Twelfth Day.  Bruce Forbes writes:In 567 the Council of Tours proclaimed that the entire period between Christmas and Epiphany should be considered part of the celebration, creating what became known as the twelve days of Christmas, or what the English called Christmastide.  On the last of the twelve days, called Twelfth Night, various cultures developed a wide range of additional special festivities.  The variation extends even to the issue of how to count the days.  If Christmas Day is the first of the twelve days, then Twelfth Night would be on January 5, the eve of Epiphany.  If December 26, the day after Christmas, is the first day, then Twelfth Night falls on January 6, the evening of Epiphany itself. Feste is a fool in the William Shakespeare comedy ""Twelfth Night"".  He is attached to the household of the Countess Olivia.  He has apparently been there for some time, as he was a ""fool that the Lady Olivia's father took much delight in"" (2.4).  Although Olivia's father has died within the last year, it is possible that Feste approaches or has reached middle age, though he still has the wit to carry off good 'fooling' when he needs to, and the voice to sing lustily or plangently as the occasion demands.  He is referred to by name only once during the play, in answer to an inquiry by Orsino of who sang a song that he heard the previous evening.  Curio responds ""Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the lady Olivia's father took much delight in.  He is about the house"" (2.4).  Throughout the rest of the play, he is addressed only as ""Fool,"" while in the stage directions he is mentioned as ""Clown."" Twelfth Night, or What You Will is a comedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written around 1601–02 as a Twelfth Night's entertainment for the close of the Christmas season.  The play centres on the twins Viola and Sebastian, who are separated in a shipwreck.

Kyburg, Jr.'s lottery paradox arises from considering a fair 1000-ticket lottery that has exactly one winning ticket.  If this much is known about the execution of the lottery it is therefore rational to accept that some ticket will win.  Suppose that an event is very likely only if the probability of it occurring is greater than 0.99.  On these grounds it is presumed rational to accept the proposition that ticket 1 of the lottery will not win.  Since the lottery is fair, it is rational to accept that ticket 2 will not win either—indeed, it is rational to accept for any individual ticket ""i"" of the lottery that ticket ""i"" will not win.  However, accepting that ticket 1 will not win, accepting that ticket 2 will not win, and so on until accepting that ticket 1000 will not win entails that it is rational to accept that ""no"" ticket will win, which entails that it is rational to accept the contradictory proposition that one ticket wins and no ticket wins.

""Les Nuits Sans Kim Wilde"" is a single by Laurent Voulzy about British singer Kim Wilde.  It was released in France as a single in 1985 after Wilde herself agreed to sing backing vocals on it.  In Germany the song was used as the B-side to ""Belle-Ile-en-Mer Marie-Galante"" (the French B-side to ""Les Nuits Sans Kim Wilde""). Les nuits d'été (""Summer Nights""), Op. 7, is a song cycle by the French composer Hector Berlioz.  It is a setting of six poems by Théophile Gautier.  The cycle, completed in 1841, was originally for soloist and piano accompaniment.  Berlioz orchestrated one of the songs in 1843, and did the same for the other five in 1856.  The cycle was neglected for many years, but during the 20th century it became, and has remained, one of the composer's most popular works.  The full orchestral version is more frequently performed in concert and on record than the piano original.  The theme of the work is the progress of love, from youthful innocence to loss and finally renewal."

The runners are Englishman Roger Bannister, American Wes Santee, and Australian John Landy.  The book's climax is Bannister's breaking of the record on May 6, 1954. John Chester Paddick (born 31 August 1943 in Newcastle-under-Lyme, England) is a British athlete.  In 1964, he represented Great Britain and Northern Ireland in the Tokyo Olympics in the men's 20 kilometre walk event and came 10th overall with a time of 1 hour, 33 minutes and 28.4 seconds.  He was just under four minutes behind the winner, Ken Matthews. The Four Minute Men were a group of volunteers authorized by United States President Woodrow Wilson, to give four-minute speeches on topics given to them by The Committee on Public Information.  In 1917-1918, around 7,555,190 speeches were given in 5,200 communities.  The topics dealt with the American war effort in the First World War and were presented during the four minutes between reels changing in movie theaters across the country.  Also, the speeches were made to be four minutes so that they could be given at town meetings, restaurants, and other places that had an audience.  This is an instance of ""viral marketing"" before its time.

It was composed in 1952, for any instrument or combination of instruments, and the score instructs the performer(s) not to play their instrument(s) during the entire duration of the piece throughout the three movements.  The piece consists of the sounds of the environment that the listeners hear while it is performed, although it is commonly perceived as ""four minutes thirty-three seconds of silence"".  The title of the piece refers to the total length in minutes and seconds of a given performance, ""4′33″"" being the total length of the first public performance. In the sport of athletics, a four-minute mile means completing a mile run (1,760 yards, or 1,609.344 metres) in less than four minutes.  It was first achieved in 1954 by Roger Bannister in 3:59.4.  The ""four-minute barrier"" has since been broken by many male athletes, and is now the standard of all male professional middle distance runners."

Several are grown for their starchy corms, an important food staple of tropical regions, known variously as ""malanga"", ""otoy"", ""otoe"", cocoyam (or new cocoyam), ""tannia"", ""tannier"", ""yautía"", ""macabo"", ""ocumo"", ""macal"", ""taioba"", ""dasheen"", ""quequisque"", ""ʻ ape"" and (in Papua New Guinea) as Singapore taro (""taro kongkong"").  Many other species (including especially ""X. roseum"") are used as ornamental plants, and in popular horticultural literature are known as ‘ape or elephant ear (from the purported resemblance of the leaf to an elephant's ear), although the latter name is sometimes also applied to members with similar appearance and uses in the closely related genera ""Caladium"", ""Colocasia"" (i.e., taro), and ""Alocasia"". Moringa oleifera is the most widely cultivated species of the genus ""Moringa"", which is the only genus in the family Moringaceae.  English common names include: moringa, drumstick tree (from the appearance of the long, slender, triangular seed-pods), horseradish tree (from the taste of the roots, which resembles horseradish), ben oil tree, or benzoil tree (from the oil which is derived from the seeds).  It is a fast-growing, drought-resistant tree, native to the southern foothills of the Himalayas in northwestern India, and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical areas where its young seed pods and leaves are used as vegetables.  It can also be used for water purification and hand washing, and is sometimes used in herbal medicine. Jasarum is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the Araceae family.  The single species that makes up the genus is Jasarum steyermarkii.  It was discovered in 1960, but wasn't described until 1977 due to classification difficulties with regards to understanding this species.  ""Jasarum"" is now believed to be closely related to ""Caladium""s and it may have evolved from ""Caladium""s that once grew in seasonal swamps. ""Jasarum steyermarkii"" is an aquatic species that is native to two river systems in Venezuela and Guyana.  It is found growing in acidic blackwater and is unique in that it is the only submerged aquatic species in Araceae endemic to South America."

His best-selling novels are ""seriocomedies"" (also known as ""comedy-drama""), often wildly poetic stories with a strong social and philosophical undercurrent, an irreverent bent, and scenes extrapolated from carefully researched bizarre facts.  His novel ""Even Cowgirls Get the Blues"" was made into a movie in 1993 by Gus Van Sant and stars Uma Thurman, Lorraine Bracco, and Keanu Reeves. The Sea Around Us is a prize-winning and best-selling book by the American marine biologist Rachel Carson, first published as a whole by Oxford University Press in 1951.  It reveals the science and poetry of the sea while ranging from its primeval beginnings to the latest scientific probings.  Often described as ""poetic,"" it was Carson's second published book and the one that launched her into the public eye and a second career as a writer and conservationist; in retrospect it is counted the second book of her so-called sea trilogy. Skinny Legs and All, novelist Tom Robbins' fifth book, was published in 1990 by Bantam Books.  As with all of Robbins' novels, it weaves disparate and seemingly unrelated themes into a single narrative. Rachel Carson is a 2017 American documentary film directed by Michelle Ferrari.  It is based on the life and work of Rachel Carson, a marine biologist and conservationist.  Her 1962 book ""Silent Spring"" would serve to advance the environmental movement.

Rachel Carson (1907–1964) was a marine biologist and nature writer whose writings are credited with advancing the global environmental movement. Under the Sea Wind: A Naturalist's Picture of Ocean Life (1941) is the first book written by the American marine biologist Rachel Carson.  It was published by Simon & Schuster in 1941, when it received very good reviews but sold poorly.  After the great success of a sequel ""The Sea Around Us"" (Oxford, 1951), it was reissued by Oxford University Press; that edition was an alternate Book-of-the-Month Club selection and became another bestseller.  It is recognised today as one of the ""definitive works of American nature writing,"" and is in print as one of the Penguin Nature Classics.

March of the Penguins (French La Marche de l'empereur ; ] ) is a 2005 French feature-length nature documentary directed and co-written by Luc Jacquet, and co-produced by Bonne Pioche and the National Geographic Society.  The documentary depicts the yearly journey of the emperor penguins of Antarctica.  In autumn, all the penguins of breeding age (five years old and over) leave the ocean, their normal habitat, to walk inland to their ancestral breeding grounds.  There, the penguins participate in a courtship that, if successful, results in the hatching of a chick.  For the chick to survive, both parents must make multiple arduous journeys between the ocean and the breeding grounds over the ensuing months.

She has played Margaret Blaine in the BBC science fiction series ""Doctor Who"", Doomsday Dora in ""The Sparticle Mystery"", Birdie Henshall in the drama series ""Cutting It"", Mavis in season 6 of ""Skins"", Ursula Crowe in children's science fiction/fantasy series ""Wizards vs Aliens"", Mrs. Glenna Fitzgibbons in season 1 of ""Outlander"" and Babe Smith in soap opera ""EastEnders"".  Badland plays Hazel Woolley in BBC Radio ""The Archers"". John Clifford, 9th Baron Clifford, (8 April 1435 – 28 March 1461), was a Lancastrian military leader during the Wars of the Roses.  The Clifford family were one of the most prominent families among the northern English nobility of the fifteenth century; and by the marriages of his sisters John Clifford had links to some very important families of the time, including the earls of Devon.  He was orphaned at about twenty years of age when his father was slain at the first battle of the Wars of the Roses, the Battle of St Albans in 1455.  It was probably as a result of his father's death there that John became one of the strongest supporters of Queen Margaret of Anjou, consort of King Henry VI, who ended up as effective leader of the Lancastrian faction.  John Clifford had already achieved prominence in the north where, as an ally of the son of the earl of Northumberland, he took part in a feud against the Neville family, the Percy's natural rivals in Yorkshire.  This consisted of a series of armed raids, assaults and skirmishes, and included an ambush on one of the younger Nevilles' wedding party in 1453.  Historians have seen a direct connection between his involvement in the local feud in the north with the Nevilles, and his involvement in the national struggle against the duke of York, whom the Nevilles were closely allied with in the late 1450s.  Although this was supposedly a period of temporary peace between the factions, Clifford and his allies appear to have made numerous attempts to ambush the Neville and Yorkist lords. Wars of national liberation or national liberation revolutions are conflicts fought by nationalities to gain independence.  The term is used in conjunction with wars against foreign powers (or at least those perceived as foreign) to establish separate sovereign states for the rebelling nationality.  From a different point of view, these wars are called insurgencies, rebellions, or wars of independence.  Guerrilla warfare or asymmetric warfare is often utilized by groups labeled as national liberation movements, often with support from other states. The Wars of the Roses was a 1963 theatrical adaptation of William Shakespeare's first historical tetralogy (""1 Henry VI"", ""2 Henry VI"", ""3 Henry VI"" and ""Richard III""), which deals with the conflict between the House of Lancaster and the House of York over the throne of England, a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.  The plays were adapted by John Barton, and directed by Barton himself and Peter Hall at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre.  The production starred David Warner as Henry VI, Peggy Ashcroft as Margaret of Anjou, Donald Sinden as the Duke of York, Paul Hardwick as the Duke of Gloucester, Janet Suzman as Joan la Pucelle, Brewster Mason as the Earl of Warwick, Roy Dotrice as Edward IV, Susan Engel as Queen Elizabeth and Ian Holm as Richard III. Blood and Roses: One family's struggle and triumph during the tumultuous Wars of the Roses, by Helen Castor, is a narrative based on the Paston letters of 15th century England.  The book traces five generations of the Pastons, an influential family from the Norfolk village of the same name."

The raw materials are squeezed under high pressure in a single step.  When used for the extraction of food oils, typical raw materials are nuts, seeds and algae, which are supplied to the press in a continuous feed.  As the raw material is pressed, friction causes it to heat up; in the case of harder nuts (which require higher pressures) the material can exceed temperatures of 120 F .

They propagate from seed or half-hardened late summer-autumn cuttings. This is a list of flora of the Lower Colorado River Valley (LCRV).  The Lower Colorado River Valley is a floristic subdivision of the Sonoran Desert geographic region of the Southwestern United States.  It includes plants that grow in the LCRV in Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah.  This area of the Sonoran Desert has unique plant communities because it is it is the most arid part of the desert and it has the highest temperatures, in excess of 120 °F during the summer.  The low humidity means that most plants must have mechanisms that deal with severe water loss through evaporation.  The soils tend to be typical desert soils, coarse and without well-developed organic horizons, and plants can only obtain soil water during and very soon after the infrequent rains.

The more commonly read version of the poem is a revision of the original, created sometime in 1590, and published in 1591 as a part of Spenser's collection ""Complaints"".  ""Mother Hubberd's Tale"" was sold separately from the rest of the collection it was published with, though the reason why is debated among scholars.  The poem follows the story of a sick, bedridden poet, who has visitors that try to entertain him with stories.  The only one the poet finds worthy enough to retell is the tale told by Old Mother Hubberd about an ape and a fox.  The poem is an allegorical poem, with overarching themes in search of political reform.  The poem was said to have antagonized Lord Burghley, the primary secretary of Elizabeth I, and estranged Spenser from the English court, despite his success in that arena with his previous (and most famous) work, ""the Faerie Queene"". Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement is a poem written by English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1796.  Like his earlier poem ""The Eolian Harp"", the poem discusses Coleridge's understanding of nature and his married life, which was suffering from problems that developed after the previous poem.  Overall, the poem focuses on humanity's relationship with nature in its various aspects ranging from experiencing an Edenic state to having to abandon a unity with nature in order to fulfill a moral obligation to humanity.  The discussion of man's obligation to each other leads into a discussion on the difference between the life of a philosopher and the life of a poet.  By the end of the poem, the narrator follows the philosophical path in a manner similar to what Coleridge sought to do.  The response to the poem from critics was mostly positive with many of them emphasizing the religious aspects of the poem in their analysis. ""A Poison Tree"" is a poem written by William Blake, published in 1794 as part of his ""Songs of Experience"" collection.  It describes the narrator's repressed feelings of anger towards an individual, emotions which eventually lead to murder.

Feral horses are descended from domestic horses that strayed, escaped, or were deliberately released into the wild and remained to survive and reproduce there.  Away from humans, over time, these animals' patterns of behavior revert to behavior more closely resembling that of wild horses.

The Georgians won a victory over the Turks.  The Georgian king asked Russian general Totleben for aid in the battle of Aspindza; in return Erekle would do his best to cultivate good relations with Russia.  General Totleben agreed to help.  As soon as the small army of Erekle and large army of Totleben were about to meet and merge, Totleben and his army changed course and returned to Russia.  Totleben's plan was to let the Ottoman Empire completely destroy the Kartli-Kakhetian army along with the king.  Russia, then, could easily incorporate the kingdom into the country.  Erekle, along with his outnumbered army, was devastated.  Nevertheless, the morale of the Georgians managed to override the Ottoman Turks, and the battle ended with a Georgian victory.

This style is rarely brewed commercially today.  It was also locally known as ""Dark Cream Common Beer"", ""Cream Beer"" or ""Common Beer"".  The beer was top-fermented and wasn't krausened, i.e., it was fermented once and sent out for sale which meant the gravity would be moderate, the carbonation low and the taste full and sweetish.  Like cream ale, it was consumed fresh, usually as draught beer.  In 1913 it was estimated that 80% of the beer consumed in Louisville was of this type.  Many local breweries made this style of beer exclusively. Grodziskie (] ; other names: Grätzer, Grodzisz) is a historical style of beer from Poland that is typically made from oak-smoked wheat malt.  The beer can be described as having a clear, light golden color, high carbonation, low alcohol content, low to moderate levels of hop bitterness, and a strong smoke flavor and aroma.  The taste is light and crisp, with primary flavors coming from the smoked malt, the high mineral content of the water, and the strain of yeast used to ferment the beverage.  The beer was nicknamed ""Polish Champagne"" because of its high carbonation levels, and because it was valued as a high-quality beverage to be used for special occasions. Fort Whoop-Up was the nickname (eventually adopted as the official name) given to a whisky trading post, originally Fort Hamilton, near what is now Lethbridge, Alberta.  During the late 19th century, the post served as a centre for various illegal activities.  The sale of whisky was outlawed but, due to the lack of a police force in the region at the time, many whisky traders had settled in the area and taken to charging unusually high prices for their goods. David McMullen is an Australian socialist economist who contends that global economic development in the 21st century will provide the necessary material basis for a classless post-capitalist society.  He expects affluence rather than poverty to become the rule by the end of this period given that it would not require unusually high growth rates, and resource and environmental constraints will be overcome by advances in technology.  With a high level of economic development, equality would no longer entail sharing poverty and lengthy toil, the main reason for classes and inequality in the past.  These views are expounded in his book ""Bright Future: Abundance and Progress in the 21st Century"". From June to September 1954, the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province.  Due to unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June."

Although the policy was originally envisaged as increasing the regular income of the Crown, much former monastic property was sold off to fund Henry's military campaigns in the 1540s.  He was given the authority to do this in England and Wales by the Act of Supremacy, passed by Parliament in 1534, which made him ""Supreme Head"" of the Church in England, thus separating England from Papal authority, and by the First Suppression Act (1536) and the Second Suppression Act (1539).

Kissinger, as a great believer in the realist school of international relations, focuses strongly upon the concepts of the balance of power in Europe prior to World War I, raison d'État and Realpolitik throughout the ages of diplomatic relations.  Kissinger also provides insightful critiques of the counter realist diplomatic tactics of collective security, developed in the Charter of the League of Nations, and self determination, also a principle of the League.  Kissinger also examines the use of the sphere of influence arguments put forth by the Soviet Union in Eastern and Southern Europe after World War II; an argument that has been maintained by contemporary Russian foreign relations with regard to Ukraine, Georgia and other former Soviet satellites in Central Asia. The Kissinger Lecture on Foreign Policy and International Relations is an annual lecture given by an invited speaker at the Library of Congress, Washington D.C.

The Geneva Conference of 1973 was an attempt to negotiate a solution to the Arab–Israeli conflict as envisioned in United Nations Security Council Resolution 338 following the called-for cease-fire to end the Yom Kippur War.  After considerable ""shuttle diplomacy"" negotiations by Henry Kissinger, the conference opened on 21 December 1973 under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary General, with the United States and the USSR as co-chairmen.  The foreign ministers of Egypt, Jordan and Israel were in attendance.  The table with Syria's nameplate remained unoccupied, although Syria had indicated possible future participation.  Each foreign minister spoke, mainly directed to their domestic audiences rather than to each other.  Kissinger articulated his step-by-step strategy and stated that the goal of the conference was peace; the immediate need was to strengthen the cease-fire by accomplishing a disengagement of forces as the ""essential first step"" toward implementation of UN 242.  The meeting was then adjourned. The Georgetown Leadership Seminar (GLS) is an annual gathering of selected rising leaders from around the world for a week of intensive discussion on major international issues.

Civil unrest can include, rioting, strikes, violent labor disputes, or minor insurrections. The Portland Rum Riot, also called the Maine Law Riot, was a brief but violent period of civil unrest that occurred in Portland, Maine on June 2, 1855, in response to the Maine law which prohibited the sale and manufacture of alcohol in the state from 1851. Neal Dow (March 20, 1804 – October 2, 1897) was an American Prohibition advocate and politician.  Nicknamed the ""Napoleon of Temperance"" and the ""Father of Prohibition"", Dow was born to a Quaker family in Portland, Maine.  From a young age, he believed alcohol to be the cause of many of society's problems and sought to ban it through legislation.  In 1850, Dow was elected president of the Maine Temperance Union, and the next year he was elected mayor of Portland.  Soon after, largely due to Dow's efforts, the state legislature banned the sale and production of alcohol in what became known as the Maine law.  Serving twice as mayor of Portland, Dow enforced the law with vigor and called for increasingly harsh penalties for violators.  In 1855, his opponents rioted and he ordered the state militia to fire on the crowd.  One man was killed and several wounded, and when public reaction to the violence turned against Dow, he chose not to seek reelection. The Neal Dow House, also known as Gen. Neal Dow House, is an historic house found at 714 Congress Street in Portland, Maine.  It was built in 1829 for noted politician and prohibitionist Neal Dow (1804-1897), and was later designated a National Historic Landmark for that association.  Dow was the author of the first prohibition law passed by the Maine legislature in 1851 (and giving such laws the epithet ""Maine law"").  He was known as a tireless, internationally known activist for the temperance movement.  Dow's house was a center of activism in his lifetime, and is now the headquarters of the Maine chapter of the Women's Christian Temperance Union. Edward Cornelius Delavan (1793–1871) was a wealthy businessman who devoted much of his fortune to promoting the temperance movement.  He helped establish the American Temperance Union; attacked the use of wine in Christian communion; established a temperance hotel in Albany, New York; traveled to Europe to promote teetotalism.  He helped spearhead the local option movement in New York during the 1840s by which local majorities could vote their towns dry.  In 1846, he received the nomination for the Governorship of New York from the Native American Party, but he declined it."

Located 90 km west of Italy, 170 km southeast of France and 11 km north of the island of Sardinia, the island is a territorial collectivity of France, but many of the region's winemaking traditions and its grape varieties are Italian in origin.  The region's viticultural history can be traced to the island's settlement by Phoceans traders in 570 BC in what is now the commune of Aléria.  In the 18th century, the island came under the control of France.  Following the independence of Algeria from French rule, many Algerian ""Pieds-Noirs"" immigrated to Corsica and began planting vineyards.  Between 1960 and 1976 the vineyard area in Corsica increased fourfold.  In 1968, Patrimonio was established as Corsica's first ""Appellation d'origine contrôlée"" (AOC).

They include eighteen species of true crabs (infraorder Brachyura); one species of hermit crab and one species of porcelain crab (infraorder Anomura); and eleven species of freshwater shrimp (infraorder Caridea). The McDonald–Kreitman test is a statistical test often used by evolution and population biologists to detect and measure the amount of adaptive evolution within a species by determining whether adaptive evolution has occurred, and the proportion of substitutions that resulted from positive selection (also known as directional selection).  To do this, the McDonald–Kreitman test compares the amount of variation within a species (polymorphism) to the divergence between species (substitutions) at two types of sites, neutral and nonneutral.  A substitution refers to a nucleotide that is fixed within one species, but a different nucleotide is fixed within a second species at the same base pair of homologous DNA sequences.  A site is nonneutral if it is either advantageous or deleterious.  The two types of sites can be either synonymous or nonsynonymous within a protein-coding region.  In a protein-coding sequence of DNA, a site is synonymous if a point mutation at that site would not change the amino acid, also known as a silent mutation.  Because the mutation did not result in a change in the amino acid that was originally coded for by the protein-coding sequence, the phenotype, or the observable trait, of the organism is generally unchanged by the silent mutation.  A site in a protein-coding sequence of DNA is nonsynonymous if a point mutation at that site results in a change in the amino acid, resulting in a change in the organism's phenotype.  Typically, silent mutations in protein-coding regions are used as the ""control"" in the McDonald–Kreitman test. Anthocharis is a Holarctic genus of the butterfly tribe Anthocharini, in the Pieridae family.  These are typically small, white-hued butterflies that have colorful marks just inside the tips of the forewings.  The tip colors are usually a red-orange hue, hence the name ""orange tip"".  The larvae of these butterfly often consume cruciferous plants containing chemicals called glucosinolates.  This genus is characterized by two of the five subcostal veins branching off before the apex of the cell, by the upper radial being only little united with the subcostal, and by the central discocellular being rather long.  In all the species the males have at least the apical portion of the forewing orange red or yellow.  Only one species inhabits also the northern districts of the Palearctic region, all the others are found in the south of the Palearctic region, also some species occur in North America, but not one species extends into the tropics.

It was a conventional single-bay biplane with staggered wings braced by N-type interplane struts.  The pilot and gunner sat in tandem, open cockpits. Heinkel designed the aircraft at the request of Aichi, in order to submit it as their entry in an IJN competition to select such an aircraft.  Heinkel built a single HD 56 prototype that was evaluated against the Nakajima Type 90-2 Reconnaissance Seaplane and the Kawanishi Type 90-3 Reconnaissance Seaplane.  The Heinkel design announced the winner in 1931, on the condition that Aichi would address some shortcomings, particularly a lack of range.  Refined versions of the ""losing"" Nakajima and Kawanishi designs would eventually see production and - in the case of the Nakajima design - in far greater numbers.

Grey relational analysis (GRA), also called Deng's Grey Incidence Analysis model, was developed by a Chinese Professor Julong Deng of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.  It is one of the most widely used models of Grey system theory.  GRA uses a specific concept of information.  It defines situations with no information as black, and those with perfect information as white.  However, neither of these idealized situations ever occurs in real world problems.  In fact, situations between these extremes are described as being grey, hazy or fuzzy.  Therefore, a grey system means that a system in which part of information is known and part of information is unknown.  With this definition, information quantity and quality form a continuum from a total lack of information to complete information – from black through grey to white.  Since uncertainty always exists, one is always somewhere in the middle, somewhere between the extremes, somewhere in the grey area.

John becomes one of ""Days of Our Lives' "" most popular characters when he is revealed to be the presumed dead Roman Brady (Wayne Northrop) with plastic surgery and amnesia.  However, Northrop's return in 1991 led to Hogestyn's Roman being retconned into the entirely separate character of John Black, which also establishes the supercouple pairing of John and Marlena, due to John's affair with Roman's wife, Marlena Evans (Deidre Hall).  During the time in which he believes he is Roman, John picks up the mantle of Roman's feud with the notorious international criminal Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo).

Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG; colloquially known as trench mouth) is a common, non-contagious infection of the gums with sudden onset.  The main features are painful, bleeding gums, and ulceration of inter-dental papillae (the sections of gum between adjacent teeth).  This disease, along with necrotizing (ulcerative) periodontitis (NP or NUP) is classified as a necrotizing periodontal disease, one of the seven general types of periodontitis.  The often severe gingival pain that characterizes ANUG distinguishes it from the more common chronic periodontitis which is rarely painful.  ANUG is the acute presentation of necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG), which is the usual course the disease takes.  If improperly treated or neglected, NUG may become chronic and/or recurrent.  The causative organisms are mostly anaerobic bacteria, particularly Fusobacteria and spirochete species.  Predisposing factors include poor oral hygiene, smoking, malnutrition, psychological stress and immunosuppression (sub-optimal functioning of the immune system).  When the attachments of the teeth to the bone are involved, the term NUP is used.  Treatment of ANUG is by debridement (although pain may prevent this) and antibiotics (usually metronidazole) in the acute phase, and improving oral hygiene to prevent recurrence.  Although the condition has a rapid onset and is debilitating, it usually resolves quickly and does no serious harm.  The synonym ""trench mouth"" arose during World War I as many soldiers developed the disease, probably because of the poor conditions and extreme psychological stress.

His best-known books, ""Ficciones"" (""Fictions"") and ""El Aleph"" (""The Aleph""), published in the 1940s, are compilations of short stories interconnected by common themes, including dreams, labyrinths, libraries, mirrors, fictional writers, philosophy, and religion. Borges on Martín Fierro concerns Argentinian Jorge Luis Borges's comments on José Hernández's nineteenth century poem ""Martín Fierro"".  Like most of his compatriots, Borges was a great admirer of this work, which he often characterized as the one clearly great work in Argentine literature.  Because ""Martín Fierro"" has been widely considered (beginning with Leopoldo Lugones's ""El Payador"", 1916) the fountainhead or pinnacle of Argentine literature, Argentina's ""Don Quixote"" or ""Divine Comedy"", and because Borges was certainly Argentina's greatest twentieth-century writer, Borges's 1953 book of essays about the poem and its critical and popular reception - ""El ""Martín Fierro"""" (written with Margarita Guerrero) - gives insight into Borges's identity as an Argentine."

Within 5 years, 115,000 people were connected to the Internet.  Since then, there has been significant growth. Daphne, Op. 82, is an opera in one act by Richard Strauss, subtitled ""Bucolic Tragedy in One Act"".  The German libretto was by Joseph Gregor.  The opera is based loosely on the mythological figure Daphne from Ovid's ""Metamorphoses"" and includes elements taken from ""The Bacchae"" by Euripides.  The opera premiered at the Semperoper in Dresden on 15 October 1938, originally intended as a double bill with Strauss' ""Friedenstag"", but as the scale of ""Daphne"" grew, that idea was abandoned.  The conductor of the first performance was Karl Böhm, to whom the opera was dedicated. The aging of wine (American English) or ageing of wine (British English) is potentially able to improve the quality of wine.  This distinguishes wine from most other consumable goods.  While wine is perishable and capable of deteriorating, complex chemical reactions involving a wine's sugars, acids and phenolic compounds (such as tannins) can alter the aroma, color, mouthfeel and taste of the wine in a way that may be more pleasing to the taster.  The ability of a wine to age is influenced by many factors including grape variety, vintage, viticultural practices, wine region and winemaking style.  The condition that the wine is kept in after bottling can also influence how well a wine ages and may require significant time and financial investment.  The quality of an aged wine varies significantly bottle-by-bottle, depending on the conditions under which it was stored, and the condition of the bottle and cork, and thus it is said that rather than good old vintages, there are good old bottles.  There is a significant mystique around the aging of wine, as its chemistry was not understood for a long time, and old wines are often sold for extraordinary prices.  However, the vast majority of wine is not aged, and even wine that is aged is rarely aged for long; it is estimated that 90% of wine is meant to be consumed within a year of production, and 99% of wine within 5 years.

It is a perennial herb growing from a tuber one to three centimeters wide.  It produces a short, erect stem reaching a maximum height of 15 centimeters.  At its smallest the plant bears only its first two rounded leaves before flowering and dying back.Its thick leaves are helpful for storing water.  If it continues to grow it produces thick, lance-shaped leaves further up the stem.  The star-shaped flowers come in inflorescences of three to 15 blooms and they are white or pink, often with veiny stripes and yellow blotches near the base of each petal.  The fruit is a small capsule containing 2 seeds, which are black and shiny.

The subdivision known as Hyland Heights was developed on a portion of the former Hyland Dairy Farm, after the business was sold to Johnson Dairy Co. in the 1960s.  The lands of the former dairy farm was subdivided and sold in lots during the 1960s and 1970s.  Transplants who moved from Catlettsburg due to the modernization/widening projects that were completed on U.S. Route 23 during that time.  The England Hill School, later renamed Cooper School, served residents in K-8, then K-6 for many years in Hyland Heights.  Cooper School was open for 26 years, from 1962 to 1988 when students were transferred to the nearby Catlettsburg or Durbin Elementary Schools depending on the location of their home address.  England Hill is a suburb of Catlettsburg, and has fought annexation into the city many times, most notably in 1987, when Catlettsburg tried to annex England Hill and all areas north of I-64. Mandalay Hill ( ] ) is a 240 m hill that is located to the northeast of the city centre of Mandalay in Burma.  The city took its name from the hill.  Mandalay Hill is known for its abundance of pagodas and monasteries, and has been a major pilgrimage site for Burmese Buddhists for nearly two centuries.  At the top of the hill is the Sutaungpyei (literally wish-fulfilling) Pagoda.  A panoramic view of Mandalay from the top of Mandalay Hill alone makes it worthwhile to attempt a climb up its stairways.  There are four covered stairways called ""saungdan"" leading up the hill from the south, southeast, west and north, and convenient seats of masonry work line these stairways all the way up.  A one-way motor road today saves time and also makes it accessible for those who are unable to climb up the stairs, leading to an escalator and a lift to the pagoda at the summit. Park Hill is a neighborhood in Denver, Colorado, U.S. Located in the northeastern quadrant of the city, it is bordered by Colorado Boulevard on the west, East Colfax Avenue on the south, Quebec Street on the east, and East 52nd Avenue on the north.

Antidunes occur in supercritical flow, meaning that the Froude number is greater than 1.0 or the flow velocity exceeds the wave velocity; this is also known as upper flow regime.  In antidunes, sediment is deposited on the upstream (stoss) side and eroded from the downstream (lee) side, opposite lower flow regime bedforms.  As a result, antidunes migrate in an upstream direction, counter to the current flow.  Antidunes are called in-phase bedforms, meaning that the water surface elevation mimics the bed elevation; this is due to the supercritical flow regime.  Antidune bedforms evolve rapidly, growing in amplitude as they migrate upstream.  The resultant wave at the water's surface also increases in amplitude.  When that wave becomes unstable, breaks and washes downstream, much of the antidune bedform may be destroyed. A reservoir capacitor is a capacitor that is used to smooth the pulsating DC from an AC rectifier.  The reservoir capacitor releases its stored energy during the part of the AC cycle when the AC source does not supply any power, that is, when the AC source changes its phase resulting in change in 'direction of flow of current'.  The change in 'direction of flow of current' of the AC source takes a very small amount of time.  In this short gap of time, the continuous flow of current gradually moves to the state when it ceases.  Using a reservoir capacitor, we fill this gap; since the capacitor releases its stored energy (gets discharged) in that gap of time.  This allows the load to be powered at all times without any interruption. Against the Current (often abbreviated as ATC) is an American pop rock band based in Poughkeepsie, New York and formed in 2011.  The band currently consists of lead vocalist Chrissy Costanza, guitarist Dan Gow, and drummer Will Ferri.

The alcohol may be an integral part of the drink, or it may be floated as a thin layer across the top of the drink.  The flames are mostly for dramatic flair.  However, in combination with certain ingredients, the flavor of the drink is altered.  Some flavors are enhanced, and it may impart a toasted flavor to some drinks. Drink mixers are the non-alcoholic ingredients in mixed drinks and cocktails.  There are many reasons mixers are used.  They change or enhance flavors or add new ones to a drink.

A masque written by Howard was produced at court during the reign of Edward VI, and he is mentioned by name in the Langham letter, which describes the Earl of Leicester's entertainment of Queen Elizabeth at Kenilworth Castle in July 1575. Charles Howard was a gentleman at the court of Henry VIII of England.  He was the second son of Lord Edmund Howard and the elder brother of Sir George Howard.  As a scion of the mighty Howard family, his uncle, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk was able to find him a position at court.

Mary had reversed the Protestant Reformation which had been started by her two predecessors, so this was the last British coronation to be conducted under the authority of the Roman Catholic Church.  Historians view Elizabeth's coronation as a statement of her intention restore England to Protestantism, but to allow the continuation of some Catholic customs, a compromise known as the Elizabethan Settlement.

He formerly worked as a lawyer and civil servant from 1965 to 1982 and was the first secretary-general of the Norwegian Humanist Association from 1980 to 1982.  He later made his mark as a writer and activist for peace and against nuclear arms.  He is the honorary president, and former president, of the Norwegian Peace Council, a former vice president of the International Peace Bureau, which received the 1910 Nobel Peace Prize, and a former vice president of the International Association of Lawyers against Nuclear Arms. The Night Riders was the name given by the press to the militant faction of tobacco farmers during a popular resistance to the monopolistic practices of the American Tobacco Company of James B. Duke.  On September 24, 1904, the tobacco planters of western Kentucky and the neighboring counties of western Tennessee formed the Dark Fired Tobacco District or Black Patch District Planters' Protective Association of Kentucky and Tennessee (called the Association or PPA).  It urged farmers to boycott the American Tobacco Company and refuse to sell at the ruinously low prices it offered in a quasi monopoly market.  A more militant faction of farmers, led by David A. Amoss of Caldwell County, Kentucky, resorted to physical intimidation or burning the crops of those who ignored the boycott, targeting the tobacco warehouses of the ATC itself, culminating in large scale raids of cities in the area - most prominently Hopkinsville, Kentucky in 1907. Brown & Williamson was an American tobacco company and subsidiary of the giant British American Tobacco, that produced several popular cigarette brands.  It became infamous as the focus of investigations for chemically enhancing the addictiveness of cigarettes.  Its former vice-president of research and development, Jeffrey Wigand, was the whistleblower in an investigation conducted by CBS news program ""60 Minutes"", an event that was dramatized in the film ""The Insider"".  Wigand claimed that B&W had introduced chemicals such as ammonia into cigarettes to increase nicotine delivery and increase addictiveness. Jeffrey S. Wigand ( ; born 17 December 1942) is an American biochemist and former vice president of research and development at Brown & Williamson in Louisville, Kentucky, who worked on the development of reduced-harm cigarettes.  He currently lectures around the world as an expert witness and consultant for various tobacco issues, and devotes time to his non-profit organization ""Smoke-Free Kids Inc"", an organization that works to help young people decide not to use tobacco. Baron Dulverton, of Batsford in the County of Gloucester, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.  It was created in 1929 for the businessman Sir Gilbert Wills, 2nd Baronet.

The Wills Baronetcy, of Northmoor in the County of Somerset, was created in 1897 for his father Frederick Wills.  He was a director of W. D. & H. O. Wills, which later merged into the Imperial Tobacco Company, and also represented Bristol North in Parliament as a Liberal Unionist.  A member of the wealthy Bristol tobacco importing Wills family, he was the younger brother of Sir Edward Wills, 1st Baronet, and the cousin of William Wills, 1st Baron Winterstoke."

Baldonnel (Irish: ""Baile Dhónaill"" , meaning ""homestead of the O'Donnels"" ), is a townland, and industrial/agricultural area near Clondalkin, Tallaght, Lucan, Saggart and Naas, in west County Dublin.  It is chiefly known as the location of the headquarters of the Irish Air Corps (Irish Defence Forces) at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, which has been in operation for over 90 years in the locality, first as a RFC then a RAF aerodrome until the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922, when the Irish Air Corps (IAC) took command of the field. The Irish Boundary Commission (Irish: ""Coimisiún na Teorainne"" ) met in 1924–25 to decide on the precise delineation of the border between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland.  The 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, which ended the War of Independence, provided for such a commission if Northern Ireland chose to secede from the Irish Free State, an event that occurred as expected two days after the Free State's inception on 6 December 1922.  The governments of the United Kingdom, of the Irish Free State and of Northern Ireland were to nominate one member each to the commission.  When the Northern government refused to cooperate, the British government assigned a Belfast newspaper editor to represent Northern Irish interests. The Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces (COS) (Irish: ""Ceann Foirne na bhFórsaí Cosanta"" ) is charged with the executive management of the Irish Defence Forces, and is the most senior military officer of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps branches.  The Chief of Staff is appointed by the President of Ireland, who is the Supreme Commander of the Defence Forces, on the recommendation of the Minister for Defence subject to the approval of the Government of Ireland.  The office of the Chief of Staff consists of his personal staff, a strategic planning office and a public relations section. The Courts of Justice Act, 1924 was an Act of the Oireachtas (No. 10 of 1924) that established a new system of courts for the Irish Free State (now the Republic of Ireland).  Among the new courts was the Supreme Court of the Irish Free State, and the first Chief Justice of the Irish Free State was also appointed under the Act. The original Irish Republican Army (IRA) fought a guerrilla war against British rule in Ireland in the Irish War of Independence between 1919 and 1921.  Following the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty on 6 December 1921, the IRA in the 26 counties that were to become the Irish Free State split between supporters and opponents of the Treaty.  The anti-Treatyites, sometimes referred to by Free State forces as Irregulars, continued to use the name Irish Republican Army (IRA) or in Irish Óglaigh na hÉireann, as did the organisation in Northern Ireland which originally supported the pro-Treaty side (if not the Treaty). "" Óglaigh na hÉireann"" was also adopted as the name of the pro-Treaty National Army, and remains the official legal title of the Irish Defence Forces.  This article deals with the anti-Treaty IRA that fought against the Irish Free State in the Irish Civil War, and with its successors up to 1969, when the IRA split again. Robert Erskine Childers DSC (25 June 1870 – 24 November 1922), universally known as Erskine Childers, was a British writer, whose works included the influential novel ""The Riddle of the Sands"", and a Fenian revolutionary who smuggled guns to Ireland in his sailing yacht ""Asgard"".  He was executed by the authorities of the nascent Irish Free State during the Irish Civil War.  He was the son of British Orientalist scholar Robert Caesar Childers; the cousin of Hugh Childers and Robert Barton; and the father of the fourth President of Ireland, Erskine Hamilton Childers."

When compared with Zebu bulls, Canchim bulls produce the same number of calves, but heavier and of superior quality.  Compared to European breeds, the Canchim bull produces calves with the same weight but in larger numbers.  The fast-growing progeny, from crossbred zebu cows with Canchim bulls, can be slaughtered at 18 months old from feedlots after weaning, up to 24 months old from feedlots after grazing and at 30 months from grazing on the range. The Ukrainian Grey Cattle or Ukrainian Steppe Cattle (Ukrainian: Сіра українська порода , Sira ukrayin'ska) is an ancient cattle breed from Ukraine.  Descended from European steppe cattle, this hardy breed has been used for meat and draft power, and is similar to breeds such as Italy's Podolica cattle and the Hungarian Grey cattle.  In this primitive breed, both cows and bulls have horns, as well as grey hides which are their namesake.  Numbers since the 1980s have been low, at around 1,000 head or less, and the breed is included in the Slow Food Ark of Taste. Bulling is a behaviour seen in cattle when one mounts another, usually when one or the other is a female in oestrus (on heat); ""bulling"" is commonly used as a term for a female in oestrus.  Female cattle in oestrus may mount any adult cattle, especially a bull (fertile male) if one is present, but they will also mount castrated males or other females.  A bulling female will often also be mounted by other cattle, both male and female (only fertile males are usually capable of mating).  A dominant bull will defend the bulling female from being mounted by other cattle. ""More Cattle, Less Bull"" is the fifth episode of the third season of ""Scandal"".  It premiered on October 31, 2013 in the U.S. Dillinger #81 (died 2004) was a two-time Professional Bull Riders (PBR) World Champion bucking bull owned by the Herrington Cattle Company.

He began his career as a classical philologist before turning to philosophy.  He became the youngest ever to hold the Chair of Classical Philology at the University of Basel in 1869, at the age of 24.  He resigned in 1879 due to health problems that plagued him most of his life, and he completed much of his core writing in the following decade.  In 1889, at age 44, he suffered a collapse and a complete loss of his mental faculties.  He lived his remaining years in the care of his mother until her death in 1897, and then with his sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, and died in 1900. Also sprach Zarathustra (German for ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"") is a book by Friedrich Nietzsche, published from 1883 to 1885. Also sprach Zarathustra (Thus Spoke Zarathustra or Thus Spake Zarathustra) is the oil painting cycle by Lena Hades painted from 1995 to 1997 and inspired by Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophical novel of the same name.  The painter created her first painting on December 1995 in Moscow.  The ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" cycle is a series of twenty-eight oil paintings made by the artist from 1995 to 1997 and thirty graphic works made in 2009.  Twenty-four of the paintings depict so-called round-headed little men and their struggles in life.  The remaining four depict Zarathustra himself, his eagle and serpent.  Six paintings of the series were purchased by the Moscow Museum of Modern Art and by some important private collectors.  The oil painting ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" series was exhibited several times — including the exhibition at the Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1997 and at the First Moscow Biennale of contemporary art in 2005. ""Faith in the Earth"" is the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche's mytho-poetic formulation of his re-valued conception of our possible experience of divinity as contained in his book ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"".  Although not traditionally religious in the sense of positing the existence of a divine entity or entities, Nietzsche's way of thinking is just as far removed from atheistic materialism as it is from theistic spiritualism.  Closely related to the tradition of negative theology, Nietzsche confesses his own oblique form of belief, from his early poem ""Dem unbekannten Gott,"" to the deep meaning of the ""Dionysian Dithyrambs"".  Put simply, we speak least erroneously when we observe a strict adherence to the use of the word ""divine"" as a verb, and not a noun.  To divine is to orient without teleology: we can divine the way without knowing where we are going, while yet still being oriented.  Nietzsche's name for this uncanny experience is ""amor fati,"" and it names not things, but a way things can change."

Klaus Kinski stars in the title role.  The soundtrack was composed and performed by West German progressive/Krautrock band Popol Vuh.  The story follows the travels of Spanish soldier Lope de Aguirre, who leads a group of conquistadores down the Orinoco and Amazon River in South America in search of the legendary city of gold, El Dorado. Aguirre is the seventh album by German band Popol Vuh.  It contains music used in the soundtrack to Werner Herzog's film ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God"" (1972), first released as an album in 1975 on Ohr, and reissued in 2004 by SPV with one bonus track.  This score was the first of many filmic collaborations between the group and Herzog.  Only two tracks (""Aguirre I"" and ""Aguirre II"") are from the film; the rest were gathered from various recordings done by the group during the period 1972–74, including alternative versions of two songs (""Morgengruß II"" and ""Agnus Dei"") originally released on the band's 1974 album, ""Einsjäger und Siebenjäger"". Lope de Aguirre (8 November 1510 – 27 October 1561) was a Basque Spanish ""conquistador"" who was active in South America.  Nicknamed ""El Loco"" ('the Madman'), he styled himself ""Wrath of God, Prince of Freedom, King of Tierra Firme"".  Aguirre is best known for his final expedition down the Amazon river in search of the mythical golden King El Dorado.  In 1561 Aguirre sent a letter which defied the Spanish monarch Philip II by declaring an independent state of Peru.  Aguirre's expedition ended with his death, and in the years since then he has been treated by historians as a symbol of cruelty and treachery in the early history of colonial Spanish America, and has become an antihero in literature, cinema and other arts. ""The Divine Image"" is a poem by the English poet William Blake from his book ""Songs of Innocence"" (1789), not to be confused with ""A Divine Image"" from ""Songs of Experience"" (1794).  It was later included in his joint collection ""Songs of Innocence and of Experience"" (1794).  In this poem (see Wikisource below) Blake pictures his view of an ideal world in which the four traditionally Christian virtues–Mercy, Pity, Peace and Love–are found in the human's heart and stand for God's support and comfort.  Joy and gratitude are sentiments expressed through prayer for the caring and blessing of an infallible almighty God and are shared by all men on Earth encompassing a sense of equality and mutual respect.

This definition has been adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) from a definition put forward by Action on Elder Abuse in the UK.  Laws protecting the elderly from abuse are similar to and related to, laws protecting dependent adults from abuse. Homeshare is the exchange of housing for help in the home.  A householder, typically an older person with a spare room, offers free or low-cost accommodation to another person in exchange for an agreed level of support.  The support may include companionship, shopping, household tasks, gardening, care of pets and, increasingly, help to use the computer.  Homeshare thus provides a solution to the needs of two groups of people - those in need of affordable housing, often younger people, and those in need of some support to live at home, usually older people.  Homeshare programmes, many run by voluntary bodies, have taken root in at least thirteen countries worldwide, some of them with public funding. The potential support ratio (PSR) is the number of people age 15–64 per one older person aged 65 or older.  This ratio describes the burden placed on the working population (unemployment and children are not considered in this measure) by the non-working elderly population.

A 'Kniereitvers' is a verse that is recited while two people play.  Usually an older person plays with a younger one (mostly a child), whereas the child sits on the older person's lap. Jailbait or jail bait is slang for a person who is younger than the legal age of consent for sexual activity, with the implication that a person above the age of consent might find them sexually attractive.  The term ""jailbait"" is derived from the fact that engaging in sexual activity with someone who is under the age of consent is classified as statutory rape or by an equivalent term.  The minor deemed sexually attractive is thus a temptation to an older person to pursue them for sexual relations at the risk of being sent to jail if caught.

A suicide mission is a task which is so dangerous for the people involved that they are not expected to survive.  The term is sometimes extended to include suicide attacks such as kamikaze and suicide bombings, where the people involved actively commit suicide during execution of the mission.  The risks involved with suicide missions are not always apparent to those participating in them or to those who plan them.  However, for an action to be considered a suicide mission someone involved must be aware of the risks.  A mission that goes horribly wrong is not a suicide mission.  An individual or group taking part in a mission may perceive the risks involved to be far greater than what they believe to be acceptable, while those planning or commanding the mission may think otherwise.  These situations can often lead to refusals to participate in missions on the basis that they are ""suicide missions"".  Similarly, planners or commanders may be well aware of the risks involved with missions while those participating in them may not.

      dtype=object), 'sent_id': array([2, 2], dtype=int32)}","The Oz books form a book series that begins with ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" (1900) and relate the fictional history of the Land of Oz.  Oz was created by author L. Frank Baum, who went on to write fourteen full-length Oz books.  All of the Baum written books are in the public domain in the United States.  Even while he was alive, Baum was styled as ""the Royal Historian of Oz"" to emphasize the concept that Oz is an actual place.  The illusion created was that characters such as Dorothy and Princess Ozma related their adventures in Oz to Baum themselves, by means of wireless telegraph. Return to Oz is a 1985 fantasy adventure film directed and written by Walter Murch, an editor and sound designer, co-written by Gill Dennis and produced by Paul Maslansky.  It stars Nicol Williamson as the Nome King, Jean Marsh as Princess Mombi, Piper Laurie as Aunt Em, Matt Clark as Uncle Henry and introduces Fairuza Balk as Dorothy Gale.  It is loosely based on L. Frank Baum's ""Oz"" novels, mainly ""The Marvelous Land of Oz"" (1904) and ""Ozma of Oz"" (1907), yet is set six months after the events of the first novel, ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" (1900) took place.  Although it is not a sequel and unrelated to the 1939 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film, ""The Wizard of Oz"", it borrows a few elements of it such as the ruby slippers. The Emerald City of Oz is the sixth of L. Frank Baum's fourteen Land of Oz books.  It was also adapted into a Canadian animated film in 1987.  Originally published on July 20, 1910, it is the story of Dorothy Gale and her Uncle Henry and Aunt Em coming to live in Oz permanently.  While they are toured through the Quadling Country, the Nome King is assembling allies for an invasion of Oz.  This is the first time in the Oz series that Baum made use of double plots for one of the books. Aunt Em is a fictional character from the Oz books.  She is the aunt of Dorothy Gale and wife of Uncle Henry, and lives together with them on a farm in Kansas.  In ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"", she is described as having been a ""young, pretty wife"" when she arrived at Uncle Henry's farm, but having been ""grayed"" by her life there, implying that she appears older than one might expect from her chronological age.  Baum tells us that when Dorothy first came to live with her, Em would ""scream and press her hand upon her heart"" when startled by Dorothy's laughter, and she appears emotionally distant to her at the beginning of the story.  However, after Dorothy is restored to her at the end of the book, we see her true nature: she cries out, ""My darling child!""  and covers her with kisses."

Electric fishes communicate electrically by one fish generating an electric field and a second individual receiving that electric field with its electroreceptors.

At first most of the Scipios who became consuls were not named Publius, probably because the eldest son rarely survived to adulthood.  The first Scipio to become consul was named Lucius, the first to become censor was also Lucius.  The first Publius to become consul was Scipio Africanus's father.  At least eleven men bearing this name have been identified in Livy and Polybius, of whom eight men were consuls (and a ninth consular tribune at a time when there were no consuls).  Of the eight men, three were censors.  Of these three, two were famous generals.  Two of the men, father and son, became Pontifex Maximus successively. Santiago Posteguillo Gómez is a Spanish philologist, linguist and author, born in Valencia in 1967.  He has become known for a number of novels set in Ancient Rome, especially his Scipio Africanus trilogy. Scipio Africanus Freeing Massiva (alt.  Scipio Liberating Massiva) is a painting depicting a scene from ancient Roman history by the Venetian artist Giovanni Battista Tiepolo (alt.  Giambattista Tiepolo), painted between 1719 and 1721.  The painting depicts the Roman general Scipio Africanus after the 209 BCE Battle of Baecula in present-day Spain where he defeated the Carthaginians, capturing their Iberian and North African allies.  The painting details the moment in which one if the captured Africans is brought before Scipio, who recognises him to be Massiva, the nephew of a chieftain of Eastern Numidia, Massinissa.  Scipio reportedly frees Massiva, sending him home to his uncle laden with gifts and so winning Massinissa’s loyalty for Rome. Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus (236–183 BC), also known as Scipio the African, Scipio Africanus-Major, Scipio Africanus the Elder and Scipio the Great, was a Roman general and later consul who is often regarded as one of the greatest generals and military strategists of all time.  His main achievements were during the Second Punic War where he is best known for defeating Hannibal at the final battle at Zama in 202 BC, one of the feats that earned him the agnomen ""Africanus"".  Prior to this battle (near modern Zama, Tunisia) Scipio also conquered Carthage's holdings in the Iberian peninsula, culminating in the Battle of Ilipa (near Alcalá del Río, Spain) in 206 BC against Hannibal's brother Mago Barca. The Battle of the Great Plains, also known as the Battle of Campi Magni or the Battle of Bagrades, was a battle fought between Scipio Africanus of Rome and a combined Carthaginian and Numidian army late in the Second Punic War, designed as diversionary tactic by Rome to disrupt Hannibal's attack on Italy."

He joined the Buccaneers in their inaugural season as their director of pro scouting, and unofficially took over the offensive coordinator role when John Rauch resigned.  By the next season, he had become the team's defensive coordinator.  He is credited with designing the Tampa Bay defense that ranked at or near the top of the league from 1978 to 1981.  He left Tampa Bay before the 1982 NFL season to join the Chargers, tasked with improving their league-last pass defense.

He has published several books of football drills and instructional techniques. The hurry-up offense is an American football offensive style, which has two different but related forms in which the offensive team avoids delays between plays.  The hurry-up no-huddle offense (HUNH) refers to avoiding or shortening the huddle to limit or disrupt defensive strategies and flexibility.  The two-minute drill is a clock-management strategy that may limit huddles but also emphasizes plays that stop the game clock.  While the two-minute drill refers to parts of the game with little time remaining on the game clock, the no-huddle may be used in some form at any time.  The no-huddle offense was pioneered by the Cincinnati Bengals and reached its most famous and complete usage by the Buffalo Bills, nicknamed the ""K-Gun"", during the 1990s under head coach Marv Levy and offensive coordinator Ted Marchibroda. The 1987 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season was a year of great change for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' organization in the National Football League.  The season began with the hiring of former New York Giants and University of Alabama head coach Ray Perkins.  Perkins had only needed three seasons to build the Giants into a playoff team, and it was hoped that he would be able to repeat the feat with the Buccaneers."

These methods have primarily been developed to study human populations, but are extended to a variety of areas where researchers want to know how populations of social actors can change across time through processes of birth, death, and migration.  In the context of human biological populations, demographic analysis uses administrative records to develop an independent estimate of the population.  Demographic analysis estimates are often considered a reliable standard for judging the accuracy of the census information gathered at any time.  In the labor force, demographic analysis is used to estimate sizes and flows of populations of workers; in population ecology the focus is on the birth, death, migration and immigration of individuals in a population of living organisms, alternatively, in social human sciences could involve movement of firms and institutional forms.

Dostoyevsky's literary works explore human psychology in the troubled political, social, and spiritual atmospheres of 19th-century Russia, and engage with a variety of realistic philosophical and religious themes. To ""call a spade a spade"" is a figurative expression which refers to calling something ""as it is"", that is, by its right or proper name, without ""beating about the bush""—being outspoken about it, truthfully, frankly, and directly, even to the point of being blunt or rude, and even if the subject is considered coarse, impolite, or unpleasant.  The idiom originates in the classical Greek of Plutarch's ""Apophthegmata Laconica,"" and was introduced into the English language in 1542 in Nicolas Udall's translation of the ""Apophthegmes,"" where Erasmus had seemingly replaced Plutarch's images of ""trough"" and ""fig"" with the more familiar ""spade.""  The idiom has appeared in many literary and popular works, including those of Oscar Wilde, Charles Dickens, W. Somerset Maugham, and Jonathan Swift.

The Midnite Sound of the Milky Way is a garage rock compilation available on compact disc put out by Big Beat Records (UK) that consists of songs recorded at the Midnite Sound recording studio in Danville, Illinois during the 1960s.  The Midnite Sound studio one of many such venues pushing out obscure garage rock in the mid-1960s.  The set was compiled by Alec Palao, who also wrote the liner notes.  The compilation features twenty four tracks by different various artists who recorded there, and all except four have not been previously compiled.  The Midnite Sound recording were often typified by an echo-laden sound, giving them a characteristically ""outer space"" vibe.  The performers tended to be, even by 1960s garage rock norms, untutored and naively strange and noncommercial racket.  The groups and artists who recorded at Midnite Sound tended to be less British Invasion-influenced than most, sometimes displaying rockabilly and pre-Beatles stylistics.  The best-known act to record for the label was rockabilly/garage rocker Dean Carter, who is known for the song ""Rebel Woman"", which has appeared on several other compilations such as his ""Call of the Wild"" anthology on Big Beat Records.

From his days at Santa Clara University to his death, he displayed a deep appreciation for classical music and an aptitude for electronics and engineering.  When he died in 1999, he was buried with a rosary and a reel of magnetic tape.  A 2006 documentary movie, ""Sound Man: WWII to MP3"", was made about his life and contributions to sound recording. Low fidelity or lo fi (adjectival form ""low-fidelity"" or ""lo-fi"") is a type of sound recording which contains technical flaws that make the recording sound different compared with the live sound being recorded, such as distortion, hum, background noise, or limited frequency response.  The term ""low-fidelity"" is used in contrast to the audiophile term high fidelity or ""hi-fi"", which refers to equipment that very accurately reproduces music without harmonic distortion or unwanted frequency emphasis or resonance.  The ideas of lo-fi are taken to extremes by the genre or ""scene"" of no fidelity, or ""no-fi"".  Some lower-budget recordings from the 1970s and 1980s have an ""unintended"" ""lo-fi"" sound because of the limitations of the analog recording and processing techniques of the time, which introduced unwanted artifacts such as distortion, hum and phase problems.  In some recordings, however, high fidelity recording is ""purposely"" avoided, or the artifacts such as simulated vinyl record crackles are deliberately retained or added in for aesthetic or historical reasons."

This season premiered in September 2013 and will finish in early December.  The main twist this season is that all the contestants have taken part in a reality show prior to this season.  Half of the contestants are veterans from previous seasons of Robinson while the other half are from the reality show Paradise Hotel.  The contestants will be split into two tribes based on which format they previously took part in. Robinson Ekspeditionen 2009 was the twelfth season of the Danish version of the Swedish show Expedition Robinson.  This season premiered on September 31, 2009 and aired until November 23, 2009.  The main twist this season was that the contestants were to be divided up into tribes based on the results of an IQ test they took before the show.  The season began with four players exiting in episode 1, only one of which was eliminated.  The first of these four was Jesper Hansen, who was evacuated due to medical reasons before the tribes were formed.  Then siblings Michael Kristiansen and Sascha Kristiansen both refused to compete in the first immunity challenge and decided to leave the show shortly after it concluded.  Beginning with the elimination of Andrew Prasana in episode 3 to the merge, all contestants voted out of the game were sent to ""Utopia"", where following the merge, they would compete to return to the game.  In another twist, a joker, Maureen Cruz, entered the game in episode 5 to replace the mole Gerard ""Anders"" Hansen, who had been ejected from the game in episode 4 as the end of the first part of the mole twist.  Another twist that took place in episode 5 was that the tribes were shuffled and given new names (Mensirip and Tenga).  Another twist that took place in episode 5 was that of the replacement mole.  The producers asked each contestant if they wanted to be the new mole and out of those who said yes the producers chose to make Ditte Jensen the new mole.  As part of this new twist, only Ditte was allowed to vote at the next tribal council.  Prior to the merge in episode 7, the remaining twelve contestants took part in a challenge to determine who would make the merge.  Ultimately, Kim Duelund and Mira Thomsen lost the challenge and were eliminated.  In episode 8, Ditte, like the first mole Anders, was ejected from the game."

The diplomacy of the American Civil War involved the relations of the United States of America and the Confederate States of America with the major world powers during the American Civil War of 1861–1865.  The United States successfully prevented other powers from recognizing the Confederacy, which counted heavily on Britain and France to enter the war on its side to maintain their supply of cotton and to weaken a growing opponent.  Every nation was officially neutral throughout the war, and none formally recognized the Confederacy. The 1860s were an extremely different decade with numerous cultural, social, and political upheavals in Europe and America.  Revolutions were prevalent in Germany and the Ottoman Empire.  The abolition of slavery in America led to the breakdown of the Atlantic Slave Trade, which was already suffering from the abolition of slavery in most of Europe in the late 1820s and ’30s.  In America, civil war between the Confederacy of the South and the Northern states led to massive deaths and the destruction of cities such as Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, Richmond, Virginia, and Atlanta, Georgia.  Sherman's March to the Sea was one of the first times America experienced total war, and advancements in military technology, such as iron and steel warships, and the development and initial deployment of early machine guns added to the destruction.

Amsinckia is a genus of flowering plants commonly known as fiddlenecks.  The common name is derived from the flower stems, bearing many small flowers, which curl over at the top in a manner reminiscent of the head of a fiddle.  Fiddlenecks are in the family Boraginaceae, along with borage and forget-me-nots.  The genus is named after the patrician Amsinck family in honour of the Hamburg head of state and patron of botany Wilhelm Amsinck (1752–1831). Pteleocarpa is a genus of flowering plants.  The only member of the genus is the western Malesian tree Pteleocarpa lamponga.  It has had a varied systematic history and has been placed in the families Icacinaceae, Cardiopteridaceae, Boraginaceae, and others.  It has long been regarded as enigmatic.  For example, its winged fruit is quite odd within the family Boraginaceae, where it was usually placed in the 2000s.  The family name Pteleocarpaceae had been used, but was not validly published until 2011, when the required description was published in Kew Bulletin.  A morphological study of ""Pteleocarpa"" was published in 2014.  Also in 2014, a molecular phylogenetic study of the lamiids (a.k.a. Garryidae) sampled ""Pteleocarpa"" and resolved it as sister to Gelsemiaceae.  Both genera of Gelsemiaceae (""Gelsemium"" and ""Mostuea"") were sampled and this result had maximum statistical support in three different methods of cladistic analysis.  The authors of that study recommended that ""Pteleocarpa"" be included in Gelsemiaceae.  This was formally done in 2014 by altering the description of the family to accommodate it."

Saturday Morning Watchmen is a Newgrounds and YouTube viral video published on March 5, 2009, the day before the release of the live-action ""Watchmen"" film.  The video parodies the DC Comics limited series ""Watchmen"" by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, claiming to be a clip from a 1980s Saturday morning cartoon based on the series.  The video was animated, written, composed and sung by Harry Partridge and voiced by Partridge, Joshua Tomar, and Hans Van Harken.

The museum also provides an overview of early 19th century Richmond, where Poe lived and worked.  The museum features the life and career of Edgar Allan Poe by documenting his accomplishments with pictures, relics, and verse, and focusing on his many years in Richmond. The works of American author Edgar Allan Poe (January 19, 1809 – October 7, 1849) include many poems, short stories, and one novel.  His fiction spans multiple genres, including horror fiction, adventure, science fiction, and detective fiction, a genre he is credited with inventing.  These works are generally considered part of the Dark romanticism movement, a literary reaction to Transcendentalism.  Poe's writing reflects his literary theories: he disagreed with didacticism and allegory.  Meaning in literature, he said in his criticism, should be an undercurrent just beneath the surface; works whose meanings are too obvious cease to be art.  Poe pursued originality in his works, and disliked proverbs.  He often included elements of popular pseudosciences such as phrenology and physiognomy.  His most recurring themes deal with questions of death, including its physical signs, the effects of decomposition, concerns of premature burial, the reanimation of the dead, and mourning.  Though known as a masterly practitioner of Gothic fiction, Poe did not invent the genre; he was following a long-standing popular tradition.

He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story.

After the discovery of the neutron in 1932, models for a nucleus composed of protons and neutrons were quickly developed by Dmitri Ivanenko and Werner Heisenberg.  Almost all of the mass of an atom is located in the nucleus, with a very small contribution from the electron cloud.  Protons and neutrons are bound together to form a nucleus by the nuclear force. Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson, (30 August 1871 – 19 October 1937) was a New Zealand-born British physicist who came to be known as the father of nuclear physics. "" Encyclopædia Britannica"" considers him to be the greatest experimentalist since Michael Faraday (1791–1867). Des Wilson (born 5 March 1941) is a New Zealand born British campaigner, political activist, businessman, sports administrator, author and poker player.  He was one of the founders of the British homelessness charity Shelter and was for a while an activist in, and President of, the British Liberal Party. The Wu experiment was a nuclear physics experiment conducted in 1956 by the Chinese American physicist Chien-Shiung Wu in collaboration with the Low Temperature Group of the US National Bureau of Standards.  The experiment's purpose was to establish whether or not conservation of parity (""P""-conservation), which was previously established in the electromagnetic and strong interactions, also applied to weak interactions.  If ""P""-conservation were true, a mirrored version of the world (where left is right and right is left) would behave as the mirror image of the current world.  If ""P""-conservation were violated, then it would be possible to distinguish between a mirrored version of the world and the mirror image of the current world. Hélène Langevin-Joliot (born 19 September 1927) is a French nuclear physicist.  She was educated at the ""IN2P3"" (English: Institute of Nuclear Physics and Particles ) at Orsay, a laboratory which was set up by her parents Irène Joliot-Curie and Frédéric Joliot-Curie.  She is a member of the French government's advisory committee.  Currently, she is a professor of nuclear physics at the Institute of Nuclear Physics at the University of Paris and a Director of Research at the CNRS.  She is also known for her work in actively encouraging women to pursue careers in scientific fields. The story of the discovery of the neutron and its properties is central to the extraordinary developments in atomic physics that occurred in the first half of the 20th century.  Early in the century, Ernest Rutherford developed a crude model for the atom, based on the gold foil experiment of Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden.  In this model, atoms had their mass and positive charge concentrated in a very small nucleus."

The Tudor architectural style is the final development of Medieval architecture in England, during the Tudor period (1485–1603) and even beyond, and also the tentative introduction of Renaissance architecture to England.  It is generally not used to refer to the whole period of the Tudor dynasty (1485-1603), but in prestige buildings to the period roughly between 1500 and 1560.  It followed the Late Gothic Perpendicular style and was superseded by Elizabethan architecture from about 1560 in domestic building of any pretensions to fashion.  In the much more slow-moving styles of vernacular architecture ""Tudor"" has become a designation for styles like half-timbering that characterise the few buildings surviving from before 1485 and others from the Stuart period.  In this form the Tudor style long retained its hold on English taste.  Nevertheless, 'Tudor style' is an awkward style-designation, with its implied suggestions of continuity through the period of the Tudor dynasty and the misleading impression that there was a style break at the accession of Stuart James I in 1603.

Thomas Browne's great-grandfather, Sir Valentine Browne, third Baronet, had been created first Viscount Kenmare by James II in March 1689.

The first and second viscounts had fought for James II but seem never to have been formally attainted under William.  Consequently, the peerage remained on the Irish patent roll in a constitutionally ambiguous position, but was not formally recognised by the Protestant political establishment."

The corals ranges can overlap with Deep-water coral but are distinguished by the presence of zooxanthellae and their requirement for light.  They can also be thought of as part of shallow water coral ecosystems, and a crossover of coral species between the two is common.  It is thought that these corals could be used as sources for reseeding shallow water coral species.

Bugliosi's 1,632-page, 1,535,791-word book (with a CD-ROM containing an additional 1,000+ pages of footnotes) analyzes all aspects of the assassination and the rise of the conspiracy theories about Kennedy's assassination in the years subsequent to the event.

Johnson through Executive Order on November 29, 1963 to investigate the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy that had taken place on November 22, 1963.  The U.S. Congress passed Senate Joint Resolution 137 authorizing the Presidential appointed Commission to report on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, mandating the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence.  Its 888-page final report was presented to President Johnson on September 24, 1964 and made public three days later.  It concluded that President Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald and that Oswald acted entirely alone.  It also concluded that Jack Ruby also acted alone when he killed Oswald two days later.  The Commission's findings have proven controversial and have been both challenged and supported by later studies. Derry is a fictional town and a part of Stephen King's fictional Maine topography.

Olga de Amaral was born as Olga Ceballos Velez in Bogotá, Cundinamarca, Colombia to parents from the Antioquia region of Colombia.  She was raised in a traditional religious family with 5 sisters and 2 brothers.  She grew up in a traditional neighbourhood in Bogotá in a warm, safe family atmosphere, maintaining a special relationship with her loving and caring mother.  Upon graduating from high school, in the years 1951-52 she got a degree in Architectural Design at the Colegio Mayor de Cundinamarca in Bogotá.  After graduation, the future textile artist worked for a year as a director of the Architectural Drawing Faculty at the same school.  In 1954, de Amaral went to the United States to study English in New York at the Columbia University.  She then moved and studied fiber art at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, USA (1954–55).  The artist cherishes that period of her education and considers it crucial for her later artistic development: ""In Cranbrook, the textile workshop had eight looms placed against the windows: one of them, in the corner, would be my home for a year.  There, I lived my most intimate moments of solitude; there was born my certainty about color; its strength; I felt as if I loved color as though it were something tangible.  I also learned to speak in color.  I remember with nostalgia that experience in which souls touched hands"".  At Cranbrook de Amaral met Jim Amaral and they became close friends.  In 1955, after a year in Cranbrook, she returned to Colombia and started to make decorative textiles on commission for her architect friends.  Meanwhile, Jim Amaral was in the U.S. Navy, on a base in the Philippines."

There is a very beautiful intaglio by him, representing Love seated and supporting himself on the ground, in the attitude of those figures of boys playing the game of astragals, which so often occurs in the works of ancient art.  The form of the letters of the name ΦΡVΓΙΛΛ, the large size of the wings of the figure of Love, and the whole style of the gem, concur to show that the artist belonged to the earlier Greek school.  There is also engraved upon this gem a bivalve shell, which also occurs on the coins of Syracuse ; whence it may be inferred that the artist was a Syracusan.  This conjecture becomes a certainty through the fact, recently published by Raoul-Rochette, that there exist medals of Syracuse, on which the name of Phrygillus is inscribed.  One medal of this type is in the possession of R. Rochette himself, who has given an engraving of it on the title-page of his Lettre a M. Schorn, by the side of an engraving of the gem already mentioned.  Another medal of this type is in the collection of the Due de Luynes.  The same collection contains another very beautiful Syracusan medal, in bronze, bearing the inscription ΦΡΥ, which no one can now hesitate to recognise as the initial letters of the name Phrygillus.  Raoul-Rochette accounts these three medals to be among the most precious remains of ancient numismatic art. The Lothair Crystal (also known as the Lothar Crystal or the Susanna Crystal) is an engraved gem from Lotharingia in North-West Europe, showing scenes of the biblical story of Susanna, dating from 855-869.

Matherpacady is populated by East Indians a Marathi language speaking, Roman Catholic ethnic group.  While it is technically correct that Marathi was the native tongue of the East Indians, the original residents of Mumbai, since the Bombay of that time was a Portuguese colony, East Indian residents of Matharpacady were well versed in Portuguese.  However with the coming of the British Rule the elders of that time realised that fluency in English was the key to better employment opportunities.  Which may also explain why Matharpacady's Portuguese heritage is rather downplayed compared to Goa's despite having some of the best preserved Portuguese style arhictecture.  ""On the way to and from Church my aunts would speak in Portuguese but they strictly forbade us from speaking in anything but English"" so related the late Sheila Gonsalves to her son.  Sheila Gonsalves was originally a Lopes and the Lopes home at the entrance to Matharpacady Village is one of the most beautiful and well preserved homes that are representative of the architecture of the late 1800s.  Diagonally across from the Lopes home is the ""Lion's Den"", a popularlandmark, and home of the Leao family sporting two stone lions flanking the entrance."

The term was coined by the Mauritian Camille de Rauville during the founding conference of the International Historical Association of the Indian Ocean in 1960 in Tananarive.  The ideology grows out of the observation that literature throughout the Indian Ocean is characterized by the preferential use of French along with some specific features such as the use of the myth of Lemuria and the region's Hindu heritage.  Indianocéanisme was long inspired by Algerianism.

Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries from the ""Coffea"" plant.  The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.  The plant was exported from Africa to countries around the world and coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa.  The two most commonly grown are the highly regarded arabica, and the less sophisticated but stronger and more hardy robusta.  Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried.  Dried coffee seeds (referred to as beans) are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor.  Roasted beans are ground and brewed with near-boiling water to produce coffee as a beverage. Latimeria is a rare genus of fish that includes two extant species: West Indian Ocean coelacanth (""Latimeria chalumnae"") and the Indonesian coelacanth (""Latimeria menadoensis"").  They follow the oldest known living lineage of Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish and tetrapods), which means they are more closely related to lungfish, reptiles and mammals than to the common ray-finned fishes.  They are found along the coastlines of the Indian Ocean and Indonesia.  Since there are only two species of coelacanth and both are threatened, it is the most endangered genus of animals in the world.  The West Indian Ocean coelacanth is a critically endangered species. The coelacanths ( ) constitute a now rare order of fish that includes two extant species in the genus ""Latimeria"": the West Indian Ocean coelacanth (""Latimeria chalumnae"") primarily found near the Comoro Islands off the east coast of Africa and the Indonesian coelacanth (""Latimeria menadoensis"")."

In 1987, after the addition of bassist Debbie Googe and vocalist-guitarist Bilinda Butcher, My Bloody Valentine released ""Strawberry Wine"", ""Ecstasy"", and the 1988 EP ""You Made Me Realise"", which were predecessors to the band's debut album ""Isn't Anything"" (1988).  Considered an independent success, the band released two further EPs before ""Loveless"" (1991), their second studio album; which is considered their ""magnum opus"" and which received unanimous critical acclaim since its release.  Both albums pioneered an alternative rock subgenre known as shoegazing, a term coined by ""Sounds"" journalists to describe certain bands' ""motionless performing style, where they stood on stage and stared at the floor"".

Philip was born in Auranitis, an Arab district east of the Sea of Galilee.  The urban and Hellenized centers of the region were Christianized in the early years of the 3rd century via major Christian centers at Bosra and Edessa; there is little evidence of Christian presence in the small villages of the region in this period, such as Philip's birthplace at Philippopolis.  Philip served as praetorian prefect, commander of the Praetorian Guard, from 242; he was made emperor in 244.  In 249, after a brief civil war, he was killed at the hands of his successor, Decius. Ofonius Tigellinus, also known as Tigellinus Ofonius, Ophonius Tigellinus and Sophonius Tigellinus (c. 10–69), was a prefect of the Roman imperial bodyguard, known as the Praetorian Guard, from 62 until 68, during the reign of emperor Nero.  Tigellinus gained imperial favour through his acquaintance with Nero's mother Agrippina the Younger, and was appointed prefect upon the death of his predecessor Sextus Afranius Burrus, a position Tigellinus held first with Faenius Rufus and then Nymphidius Sabinus. Lucius Seius Strabo or Lucius Aelius Strabo was a prefect of the Roman imperial bodyguard, known as the Praetorian Guard, during the rule of the emperors Augustus and Tiberius.  The length of Strabo's tenure as Praetorian prefect is unknown, but he held the position together with various colleagues until 15, after which he was appointed to the governorship of Egypt.  With this career Strabo distinguished himself by attaining the two highest offices open to men of the equestrian class in the Roman Empire. Praetorian prefect (Latin: ""praefectus praetorio"" , Greek: ) was the title of a high office in the Roman Empire.  Originating as the commander of the Praetorian Guard, the office gradually acquired extensive legal and administrative functions, with its holders becoming the Emperor's chief aides.  Under Constantine I, the office was much reduced in power and transformed into a purely civilian administrative post, while under his successors, territorially-defined praetorian prefectures emerged as the highest-level administrative division of the Empire.  The prefects again functioned as the chief ministers of the state, with many laws addressed to them by name.  In this role, praetorian prefects continued to be appointed until the reign of Heraclius in the 7th century AD, when wide-ranging reforms reduced its power and converted it to a mere overseer of provincial administration.  The last traces of the prefecture disappeared in the Byzantine Empire by the 840s. Claudia Capitolina (Greek: η Κλαuδία Καπιτωλίνα ) was an Egyptian Greek woman who lived in the Roman Empire, in the 1st century and possibly in the 2nd century.  Capitolina came from a distinguished family of Equestrian rank.  She was born and raised in Alexandria, Egypt.  Capitolina was the daughter and only child of Tiberius Claudius Balbilus by his unnamed wife."

There are three types of models: statistical, dynamical, or combined statistical-dynamic.  Dynamical models utilize powerful supercomputers with sophisticated mathematical modeling software and meteorological data to calculate future weather conditions.  Statistical models forecast the evolution of a tropical cyclone in a simpler manner, by extrapolating from historical datasets, and thus can be run quickly on platforms such as personal computers. Statistical-dynamical models use aspects of both types of forecasting.  Four primary types of forecasts exist for tropical cyclones: track, intensity, storm surge, and rainfall.  Dynamical models were not developed until the 1970s and the 1980s, with earlier efforts focused on the storm surge problem.

In public settings, computer lab users are often subject to time limits, in order to allow more people a chance to use the lab, whereas in other institutions, computer access typically requires valid personal login credentials, which may also allow the institution to track the user's activities.  Computers in computer labs are typically equipped with internet access, while scanners and printers may augment the lab setup.  Computers in computer labs are typically arranged either in rows, so that every workstation has a similar view of one end of the room to facilitate lecturing or presentations, or in clusters, to facilitate small group work.  In some cases, generally in academic institutions, student laptops or laptop carts take the place of dedicated computer labs, although computer labs still have a place in applications requiring special software or hardware not practically implementable in personal computers.

The Akita (秋田犬 , Akita-inu, Akita-ken ) is a large breed of dog originating from the mountainous northern regions of Japan.  There are two separate varieties of Akita: a ""Japanese"" strain, commonly called ""Akita Ken"" in Japan, ""Akita Inu"" (""inu"" means ""dog"" in Japanese), or ""Japanese Akita""; and an ""American"" strain, known as the ""Akita"" or ""American Akita"".  The Japanese strain called the Akita Inu comes in a narrow palette of colors, with all other colors considered atypical of the breed, while the American strain known simply as the Akita comes in all dog colors.  The Akita has a short double-coat similar to that of many other northern spitz breeds such as the Siberian Husky, but long-coated dogs can be found in many litters due to a recessive gene.

It is a highly versatile dog that can excel in agility, obedience and working trials.  Although there are a little over 600 Tamaskans worldwide registered in these organizations, increasing interest has resulted in their spread throughout continental Europe, the UK, United States, Canada, and Australia.

In February 2006, this monopoly became a duopoly when a new telephone company and Internet service provider (ISP), du, was established to offer mobile services across the UAE and Internet and TV services to some free zone areas.  However, due to geographical distribution of service areas, the companies do not compete for customers and thus effectively operate as monopolies.

It began in Chicago, Illinois in 1913 under the initiative of Ida B. Wells-Barnett and her white colleague, Belle Squire.  The Club aimed to reinforce African American involvement in the struggle for women's suffrage, due to African American women being unable to be involved in the National American Women Suffrage Association (NAWSA).  The Alpha Suffrage Club was established to partially give a voice to women who could not represent their selves individually, and worked specifically towards giving a voice to black women, as well as to “politicize” black women into the government system.  In 1916, the club had nearly 200 members, including well-known female suffrage activists Mary E. Jackson, Viola Hill, Vera Wesley Green, and Sadie L. Adams.  Within the next three years the group burgeoned into the thousands.  The women were motivated by and sought to put an end to the countless lynchings of African Americans.

The settlement house, located on Manhattan's Upper West side in the neighborhood known then as San Juan Hill, was founded to offer refuge, shelter and food for newly arrived African American /Colored women from the southern United States and the West Indies.  Aware of the perilous conditions for young African American women seeking work in New York City, Matthews and Lyons and other volunteers working with The White Rose Mission met incoming vessels.  At Manhattan’s piers, docks and railway stations, volunteers offered assistance to female travelers who often fell prey to unscrupulous employment agents and con artists.  As traveler’s assistance services were generally not available to African American women, the White Rose Mission, under the direction of Victoria Earle Matthews, was founded to address the specific problems facing African American female migrants."

The Quaternary Period is divided into two epochs: the Pleistocene (2.588 million years ago to 11.7 thousand years ago) and the Holocene (11.7 thousand years ago to today).  The informal term ""Late Quaternary"" refers to the past 0.5–1.0 million years. The Taconic orogeny was a mountain building period that ended 440 million years ago and affected most of modern-day New England.  A great mountain chain formed from eastern Canada down through what is now the Piedmont off the East coast of the United States.  As the mountain chain eroded in the Silurian and Devonian periods, sediments from the mountain chain spread throughout the present-day Appalachians and midcontinental North America. Cameron's Line is an Ordovician suture fault in the northeast United States which formed as part of the continental collision known as the Taconic orogeny around 450 mya.  Named after Eugene N. Cameron, who first described it in the 1950s, it ties together the North American continental craton, the prehistoric Taconic Island volcanic arc, and the bottom of the ancient Iapetus Ocean. The Cobequid Fault is a fault that is the extension of the Chedabucto Fault.  This fault runs from Truro to Cape Chignecto south of the Cobequid Hills.  Both the Cobequid fault and the Chedabucto Fault form the Minas Fault zone splitting Nova Scotia into the Avalon Zone and the Meguma Zone.  Movement on the Cobequid Fault started before 400 million years ago and end around 40 million years ago.  Between that time around 350 million years violent volcanic eruptions at Spicers Cove north Cape Chignecto Provincial Park and 50 million years after grey sandstone rich in fossil plants were deposited.  At Five Islands Provincial Park there are red rocks formed by the large accumulation of mud, sand and gravel around 210 million years ago. Before photosynthesis evolved, Earth's atmosphere had no free oxygen (O).  Photosynthetic prokaryotic organisms that produced O as a waste product lived long before the first build-up of free oxygen in the atmosphere, perhaps as early as 3.5 billion years ago.  The oxygen they produced would have been rapidly removed from the atmosphere by weathering of reducing minerals, most notably iron.  This ""mass rusting"" led to the deposition of iron oxide on the ocean floor, forming banded iron formations.  Oxygen only began to persist in the atmosphere in small quantities about 50 million years before the start of the Great Oxygenation Event."

He was elected King of Germany at Frankfurt on 4 March 1152 and crowned in Aachen on 9 March 1152.  He became King of Italy in 1155 and was crowned Roman Emperor by Pope Adrian IV on 18 June 1155.  Two years later, the term ""sacrum "" (""holy"") first appeared in a document in connection with his Empire.  He was later formally crowned King of Burgundy, at Arles on 30 June 1178.  He was named ""Barbarossa "" by the northern Italian cities which he attempted to rule: Barbarossa means ""red beard"" in Italian; in German, he was known as ""Kaiser Rotbart "", which has the same meaning. The Barbarossa Chandelier (German: ""Barbarossaleuchter"") was made on the order of Emperor Frederick I, nicknamed Barbarossa, and his wife Beatrice sometime between 1165 and 1170 and was installed under the cupola of the Palatine Chapel in Aachen Cathedral.  The chandelier was a donation in honour of Mary, Mother of God, the patroness of Aachen Cathedral and simultaneously represented a tribute to the builder of the cathedral, Charlemagne. Holy Roman Empress or Empress of the Holy Roman Empire is the title given to the consort (wife) or regent of the Holy Roman Emperor.  The elective dignity of Holy Roman Emperor was restricted to males only, therefore there was never a Holy Roman Empress regnant, though women such as Theophanu or Maria Theresa of Austria, who controlled the power of rule, served as de facto Empresses regnant.

It was believed to be donated by Bishop Azelin, however his predecessor Thietmar is more likely to be the patron.  Therefore, the chandelier is also called the Thietmar chandelier (""Thietmarleuchter""). The monarchs of Prussia were members of the House of Hohenzollern who were the hereditary rulers of the former German state of Prussia from its founding in 1525 as the Duchy of Prussia.  The Duchy had evolved out of the Teutonic Order, a Roman Catholic crusader state and theocracy located along the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea.  The Teutonic Knights were under the leadership of a Grand Master, the last of whom, Albert, converted to Protestantism and secularized the lands, which then became the Duchy of Prussia.  The Duchy was initially a vassal of the Kingdom of Poland, as a result of the terms of the Prussian Homage whereby Albert was granted the Duchy as part of the terms of peace following the Prussian War.  When the main line of Prussian Hohenzollerns died out in 1618, the Duchy passed to a different branch of the family, who also reigned as Electors of Brandenburg in the Holy Roman Empire.  While still nominally two different territories, Prussia under the suzerainty of Poland and Brandenburg under the suzerainty of the Holy Roman Empire, the two states are known together historiographically as Brandenburg-Prussia."

The breed's officially recognized name is German Shepherd Dog in the English language (sometimes abbreviated as ""GSD"").  The breed is also known as the Alsatian in Britain and Ireland.  The German Shepherd is a relatively new breed of dog, with their origin dating to 1899.  As part of the Herding Group, German Shepherds are working dogs developed originally for herding sheep.  Since that time however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience, German Shepherds around the world are often the preferred breed for many types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police and military roles, and even acting.  The German Shepherd is the second-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club and fourth-most registered breed by The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom. The West Siberian Laika or ""WSL"", is a breed of hunting dog and a breed of spitz type.  Russian publications indicate that the term West Siberian Laika loosely applied to hunting dogs originating with the Mansi and Khanty people in Ural and West Siberia, but there were no standards or registrations of WSL as such until 1930.  Then WWll disrupted it for a while, but ""systematic breeding with registrations"" resumed after the war ended, in 1946.  This was the time the breed began taking modern shape.  Before that hunters only knew of Mansi Laika and Khanty Laika.  In early 1960 many hunters in Ural still preferred the term Mansi Laika, when speaking of West Siberian Laika.  In Russian language, the term Laika originated from the word ""layat"" that means to bark.  The word Laika simply means ""barker"".  Any hunting Laika is a bark pointer (pointing at animal of interest by barking and staying with the animal ).  It is a versatile dog depending on use and environment, but in certain parts of the country they have become more specialized. Conformation in dogs refers solely to the externally visible details of a dog's structure and appearance, as defined in detail by each dog breed's written breed standard.  A dog that ""conforms"" to most of the items of description in its individual breed standard is said to have ""good conformation"".  Unlike equine conformation, there are no fixed rules for dog conformation, as dogs are the most variable in appearance of any animals (""Phenotypic variation among dog breeds, whether it be in size, shape, or behavior, is greater than for any other animal"")."

Its most famous application was in a rotor-based cipher machine, the Hagelin M-209.  The Beaufort cipher is based on the Beaufort square which is essentially the same as a Vigenère square but in reverse order starting with the letter ""Z"" in the first row, where the first row and the last column serve the same purpose. In the history of cryptography, Typex (alternatively, Type X or TypeX) machines were British cipher machines used from 1937.  It was an adaptation of the commercial German Enigma with a number of enhancements that greatly increased its security.  The cipher machine (and its many revisions) was used until the mid-1950s when other more modern military encryption systems came into use. Heath Robinson was a machine used by British codebreakers at the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park during World War II in Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher.  This achieved the decryption of messages in the German teleprinter cipher produced by the Lorenz SZ40/42 in-line cipher machine.  Both the cipher and the machines were called ""Tunny"" by the codebreakers, who named different German teleprinter ciphers after fish.  It was mainly an electro-mechanical machine, containing no more than a couple of dozen valves (vacuum tubes), and was the predecessor to the electronic Colossus computer.  It was dubbed ""Heath Robinson"" by the Wrens who operated it, after cartoonist William Heath Robinson, who drew immensely complicated mechanical devices for simple tasks, similar to (and somewhat predating) Rube Goldberg in the USA. In cryptography, the M-209, designated CSP-1500 by the United States Navy (C-38 by the manufacturer) is a portable, mechanical cipher machine used by the US military primarily in World War II, though it remained in active use through the Korean War.  The M-209 was designed by Swedish cryptographer Boris Hagelin in response to a request for such a portable cipher machine, and was an improvement of an earlier machine, the C-36. The Enigma machines were a series of electro-mechanical rotor cipher machines developed and used in the early- to mid-20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic and military communication.  Enigma was invented by the German engineer Arthur Scherbius at the end of World War I.  Early models were used commercially from the early 1920s, and adopted by military and government services of several countries, most notably Nazi Germany before and during World War II.  Several different Enigma models were produced, but the German military models, having a plugboard, were the most complex.  Japanese and Italian models were also in use. BID 610 or Alvis was a British cipher machine used by both British and Canadian governments.  It was the first fully transistorised full-duplex online cipher machine used by the British Army."

The Khoshut Khanate was an Oirat khanate based in the Tibetan Plateau in the 17th and the 18th centuries.  It was established in 1642 by Güshi Khan, a Khoshut prince and leader of the Upper Mongols.  He was enthroned by the Dalai Lama as Khan and protector-ruler of Tibet.  With Güshi Khan as a largely uninvolved overlord, the 5th Dalai Lama and his intimates established a civil administration which is referred to by historians as the ""Lhasa state"".  This Tibetan regime or government is also referred to as the Ganden Phodrang.  the Ganden Phodrang government lasted until the 1950s, when Tibet was incorporated into the People's Republic of China.  The Khoshut Khanate was conquered by the troops of the Dzungar Khanate in 1717, who deposed Yeshe Gyatso, a pretender to the position of the Dalai Lama promoted by Lha-bzang Khan, the last ruler of the Khoshut Khanate.

The ballpark was located southeast of Congress Avenue Bridge.  It was also the place of the largest shutout in Texas League history on July 23, 1907 between the Austin Senators and the San Antonio Bronchos in the second game of a doubleheader.  In the early 20th century, Austin and San Antonio were bitter rivals, and this was no exception.  During the first game, an Austin baserunner who had overslid 3rd base was tagged but was called safe by the umpire.  (At the time, there was only one umpire who made the decisions of ""out,"" ""safe,"" ""strike,"" and ""ball."")  The Bronchos felt slighted that day by the umpire in-charge on many calls and tried to get the call changed.  The umpire did not change his call, and the Bronchos left the field in protest forfeiting the game to Austin.  Because a forfeit was not viable due to potential hefty fines levied by the league offices, San Antonio came up with a form of retaliation for the 2nd game.  Infielder Art Griggs was the starting pitcher; Griggs was relieved by another infielder Ike Pendleton soon after and followed by George ""Cap"" Leidy.  The Senators batted in order the whole game while the Bronchos batted whenever they wanted to and batted out of order also.  Austin stole 23 bases, scored 44 runs on 36 hits due to San Antonio's sloppy defense, which made nine errors, and farcical pitching.  The final score was Austin 44, San Antonio 0; the score looked more like a football score than baseball score. Robert G.

Chonma near Kaesong, North Korea.  The site is one of the National Treasures of North Korea.  Named after Guanyin, the buddhist bodhisattva of compassion, this small temple is located in the beautiful valley between Mts.  Chonma and Songgo.  The temple was founded in 970 when a monk deposited two marble statues of the goddess in a cave behind the temple's current location.  The temple itself was constructed in 1393 under the Koryo Dynasty, and later renovated in 1646 under the Joseon.  The site contains many ancient relics, including a seven-story pagoda from the Koryo dynasty and the ancient Guanyin statues in Kwanum Cave.  The doors of the main shrine, known as the Taeung Hall, are decorated with carved flowers and leaves; an old legend relays why the decorations on one door are unfinished.  During the reconstruction of the temple during the Joseon dynasty, one of the main carvers was a twelve-year-old boy named Unna, famed for his skill in carving.  One day, while working on the temple, he heard his mother was seriously ill, and asked to be allowed to visit her.  He was refused, and his mother died shortly after.  He blamed himself and his skillful hands for his mother's death, and so out of grief used his carving axe to chop off his hand.  He then disappeared into the forest, never to be seen again.  Today, a carving of a boy with one hand ascending to heaven on the back of a white tiger can still be seen on the unfinished door.

Some of the threats have been extended to members of Obama's family, including First Lady Michelle Obama.  Obama and his officials have generally declined to discuss death threats against him since entering the presidential race.  Some commentators have suggested the unusually high number of death threats surrounding Obama are at least partially tied to the use of racist imagery and words used by some of Obama's critics to describe the president.  In 2009 journalist Ronald Kessler reported that Obama received 400 percent more death threats than his predecessor.  Later that year, the Secret Service stated that the volume of threats against Obama was ""comparable to that under George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.""

(""Give Me That"") ""Old-Time Religion"" (and similar spellings) is a traditional Gospel song dating from 1873, when it was included in a list of Jubilee songs—or earlier.  It has become a standard in many Protestant hymnals, though it says nothing about Jesus or the gospel, and covered by many artists.  Some scholars, such as Forrest Mason McCann, have asserted the possibility of an earlier stage of evolution of the song, in that ""the tune may go back to English folk origins"" (later dying out in the white repertoire but staying alive in the work songs of African Americans).  In any event, it was by way of Charles Davis Tillman that the song had incalculable influence on the confluence of black spiritual and white gospel song traditions in forming the genre now known as southern gospel.  Tillman was largely responsible for publishing the song into the repertoire of white audiences.  It was first heard sung by African-Americans and written down by Tillman when he attended a camp meeting in Lexington, South Carolina in 1889. Gospel music is a genre of Christian music.  The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of gospel music varies according to culture and social context."

She was designed by Mikhail Petrovich Nalyotov as the world's first submarine minelayer, although due to construction delays the German UC submarines entered service earlier.  The mines were stowed in two horizontal galleries exiting through the stern.  Diving depth was 45 metres.  This ship was built by the Naval yard in Nikolayev by the Black Sea (now Mykolaiv, Ukraine).  She was ordered in 1908, launched in September 1912 (or early 1913, sources differ) and entered service in 1915. The ""Vetehinen""-class submarine was a Finnish 500 tonne submarine class of three vessels that was designed and built in the 1920s and early 1930s.  The ""Vetehinen"" class served in the Finnish Navy during World War II.  The class was designed by Dutch dummy company Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw den Haag (I.v.S) (set up by Germany after World War I in order to maintain and develop German submarine know-how and to circumvent the limitations set by the Treaty of Versailles) and built by the Finnish Crichton-Vulcan shipyard in Turku.  The class was based on the German World War I Type UB III and Type UC III submarines and served as prototype for Type VII submarines. The Danish UC submarines are a series of privately designed, built, and operated, subs by Peter Madsen and associates at Ubadsklubben Freya. The C-class submarines were five United States Navy submarines built by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company in Quincy, Massachusetts, under a subcontract from the Electric Boat Company.  Built between 1906 and 1909, and in commission from 1908 to 1919, all five were subsequently sold for scrap in 1920.  They were considerably larger than the preceding B class at 275 tons submerged vs. 173 tons submerged, and were the first United States submarines with two-shaft propulsion, doubling the machinery of the B class. The ""Havmanden"" class was a class of six submarines built for the Royal Danish Navy from 1911 to 1914.  Also later known as the A class, the boats were designed by the Austro-Hungarian firm Whitehead & Co. of Fiume.  The first three submarines were built by the company, while the remaining three were constructed under license in Copenhagen. The United States L-class submarines were a class of 11 submarines built 1914–1917, and were the United States Navy's first attempt at designing and building ocean-going submarines.  At the time there was a significant gap in long-range submarine design compared with other major navies.  The ""Group 2"" L-boats designed by Lake Torpedo Boat Company (""L-5"" through ""L-8"") were built to slightly different specifications from the other ""Group 1"" L-boats (which were designed by Electric Boat) and are sometimes considered a separate L-5 class."

William Hayden English (August 27, 1822 – February 7, 1896) was an American congressman from Indiana and the Democratic nominee for vice president in 1880.  English entered politics at a young age, becoming a part of Jesse D. Bright's conservative faction of the Indiana Democratic Party.  After a few years in the federal bureaucracy in Washington beginning in 1845, he returned to Indiana and participated in the state constitutional convention of 1850.  He was elected to the state house of representatives in 1851 and served as its speaker at the age of twenty-nine.  After a two-year term in the state house, English represented Indiana in the federal House of Representatives for four terms from 1853 to 1861, working most notably to achieve a compromise on the admission of Kansas as a state. The California Gold Rush (1848–1855) began on January 24, 1848, when gold was found by James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California.  The news of gold brought some 300,000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad.  The sudden influx of immigration and gold into the money supply reinvigorated the American economy, and California became one of the few American states to go directly to statehood without first being a territory, in the Compromise of 1850.  The Gold Rush initiated the California Genocide, with 100,000 Native Californians dying between 1848 and 1868.  By the time it ended, California had gone from a thinly populated ex-Mexican territory to the home state of the first nominee for the Republican Party. The Admission Day Monument is an 1897 sculpture by Douglas Tilden, located at the intersection of Market Street and Montgomery Street in San Francisco, California, United States.  It commemorates California Admission Day (September 9, 1850), the date on which the state became part of the Union, following the Mexican-American war of 1848. Human history in California begins with indigenous Americans first arriving in California some 13,000–15,000 years ago.  Exploration and settlement by Europeans along the coasts and in the inland valleys began in the 16th century.  California was acquired by the United States under the terms of the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo following the defeat of Mexico in the Mexican–American War.  American westward expansion intensified with the California Gold Rush, beginning in 1849.  California joined the Union as a free state in 1850, due to the Compromise of 1850.

It includes all of the major genres of sacred and secular, instrumental and vocal music.  French classical styles often have an identifiably national character, ranging from the clarity and precision of the music of the late Renaissance music to the sensitive and emotional Impressionistic styles of the early 20th century.  Important French composers include Pérotin, Machaut, Dufay, Josquin des Prez, Lully, Charpentier, Couperin, Rameau, Leclair, Grétry, Méhul, Auber, Berlioz, Alkan, Gounod, Offenbach, Franck, Lalo, Saint-Saëns, Delibes, Bizet, Chabrier, Massenet, Widor, Fauré, d'Indy, Chausson, Debussy, Dukas, Louis Vierne, Duruflé, Satie, Roussel, Hahn, Ravel, Honegger, Milhaud, Poulenc, Auric, Messiaen, Françaix, Dupré, Dutilleux, Boulez, Guillou, Grisey, and Murail.

Marc Jean Roland Antoine Vouilloux (born 28 May 1963) known professionally as Marc Antoine, is a jazz guitarist from France. Musical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music.  People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music.  In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist.  ""Composition"" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music.  In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music ""score"", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers.  In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression.  In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration.  In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory."

The incident made worse the guerrilla war in Kansas Territory that became known as Bleeding Kansas. Free-Staters were those settlers in Kansas Territory during the Bleeding Kansas era in the 1850s who opposed the extension of slavery to Kansas.  The name derives from the term ""free state"", that is, a U.S. state without slavery. The Pottawatomie massacre occurred during the night of May 24 and the morning of May 25, 1856.  In reaction to the sacking of Lawrence, Kansas by pro-slavery forces, John Brown and a band of abolitionist settlers—some of them members of the Pottawatomie Rifles—killed five settlers north of Pottawatomie Creek in Franklin County, Kansas.  This was one of the many bloody episodes in Kansas preceding the American Civil War, which came to be known collectively as Bleeding Kansas.  Bleeding Kansas was largely brought about by the Missouri Compromise and the Kansas–Nebraska Act. The New England Emigrant Aid Company (originally the Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Company) was a transportation company in Boston, Massachusetts, created to transport immigrants to the Kansas Territory to shift the balance of power so that Kansas would enter the United States as a free state, rather than a slave state.  Created by Eli Thayer in the wake of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which allowed the population of Kansas Territory to choose whether slavery would be legal, the Company is noted less for its direct impact than for the psychological impact it had on proslavery and antislavery elements.  Thayer's prediction that the Company would eventually be able to send 20,000 immigrants a year never came to fruition, but it spurred Border Ruffians from nearby Missouri, where slavery was legal, to move to Kansas to ensure its admission to the Union as a slave state.  That, in turn, further galvanized Free-Staters and enemies of Slave Power. John Brown (May 9, 1800 – December 2, 1859) was an American abolitionist who believed and advocated that armed insurrection was the only way to overthrow the institution of slavery in the United States.  Brown first gained attention when he led small groups of volunteers during the Bleeding Kansas crisis of 1856.  Dissatisfied with the pacifism of the organized abolitionist movement, he said, ""These men are all talk.  What we need is action—action!""  During the Kansas campaign, Brown commanded forces at the Battle of Black Jack and the Battle of Osawatomie.  He and his supporters killed five supporters of slavery in the Pottawatomie massacre of May 1856 in response to the sacking of Lawrence by pro-slavery forces. Martin Franklin Conway (November 19, 1827 – February 15, 1882) was a U.S. congressman, consul to France, abolitionist, and advocate of the Free-State movement in Kansas.

The valley is bounded to the east by the Blue Ridge Mountains, to the west by the eastern front of the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians (excluding Massanutten Mountain), to the north by the Potomac River and to the south by the James River.  The cultural region covers a larger area that includes all of the valley plus the Virginia highlands to the west, and the Roanoke Valley to the south.  It is physiographically located within the Ridge and Valley province and is a portion of the Great Appalachian Valley. The Blue Ridge Mountains are a physiographic province of the larger Appalachian Mountains range.  This province consists of northern and southern physiographic regions, which divide near the Roanoke River gap.  The mountain range is located in the eastern United States, starting at its southernmost portion in Georgia, then ending northward in Pennsylvania.  To the west of the Blue Ridge, between it and the bulk of the Appalachians, lies the Great Appalachian Valley, bordered on the west by the Ridge and Valley province of the Appalachian range. The Great Wagon Road was an improved trail through the Great Appalachian Valley from Pennsylvania to North Carolina, and from there to Georgia in colonial America. The covered wagon was long the dominant form of transport in pre-industrial America.  With roots in the heavy Conestoga wagon developed for the rough, undeveloped roads and paths of the colonial East, the covered wagon spread west with American migration.  Heavily relied upon along such travel routes as the Great Wagon Road and the Santa Fe and Oregon Trails, it carried settlers seeking land, gold, and new futures ever further west. The Great Indian Warpath (GIW)—also known as the Great Indian War and Trading Path, or the Seneca Trail—was that part of the network of trails in eastern North America developed and used by Native Americans which ran through the Great Appalachian Valley.  The system of footpaths (the Warpath branched off in several places onto alternate routes and over time shifted westward in some regions) extended from what is now upper New York state to deep within Alabama.  Various Indians traded and made war along the trails, including the Catawba, numerous Algonquian tribes, the Cherokee, and the Iroquois Confederacy.  The British traders' name for the route was derived from combining its name among the northeastern Algonquian tribes, ""Mishimayagat"" or ""Great Trail"", with that of the Shawnee and Delaware, ""Athawominee"" or ""Path where they go armed"". The Cumberland Valley is a northern constituent valley of the Great Appalachian Valley, within the Atlantic Seaboard watershed in Pennsylvania and Maryland.  The Appalachian Trail crosses through the valley. The Shawangunk Ridge , also known as the Shawangunk Mountains or The Gunks, is a ridge of bedrock in Ulster County, Sullivan County and Orange County in the state of New York, extending from the northernmost point of New Jersey to the Catskill Mountains.  Shawangunk Ridge is the continuation of the long, easternmost ridge of the Appalachian Mountains; the ridge is known as Kittatinny Mountain in New Jersey, and as Blue Mountain as it continues through Pennsylvania."

His father was the painter Stefano di Francesco (died 1427), and his maternal grandfather was the painter Giuliano Pesello (1367–1446), from whose name the diminutive nickname of ""Pesellino"" arose.  After the death of his father in 1427, the young Francesco Pesellino went to live with his grandfather, Giuliano Pesello, adopting his name.  Francesco Pesellino remained in his grandfather’s studio until the latter’s death, when he joined the studio of Filippo Lippi (ca.1406-1469).

He was eventually apprehended, tried, and convicted, and started serving his sentence in the Sremska Mitrovica penitentiary.  He managed to escape from prison and had a warrant for his capture, returning home where he was unwelcomed.  Čaruga left for the woods, where he befriended a gang, ""Kolo gorskih tića"" (""Band of Mountain Birds""), composed mostly of deserters, who all detested the rich Slavonian peasants and robbed them mercilessly, and were not afraid of killing people.  He used the false names Nikola Drezgić and Mile Barić.  The war was long over, but Čaruga and the gang were still pillaging the countryside, and became hunted by the Yugoslav gendarmerie.

The theory held that control over cotton exports would make a proposed independent Confederacy economically prosperous, would ruin the textile industry of New England, and—most importantly—would force Great Britain and perhaps France to support the Confederacy militarily because their industrial economies depended on Southern cotton.  The slogan, widely believed throughout the South, helped in mobilizing support for secession: by February 1861, the seven states whose economies were based on cotton plantations had all seceded and formed the Confederacy (C.S.A.).  Meanwhile, the other eight slave states, with little or no cotton production, remained in the Union. On April 15, 1861, at the start of the American Civil War, the President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, called for a 75,000-man militia to serve for three months following the bombardment and surrender of Fort Sumter.  Some slave states refused to send troops against their neighboring slave states, with the result that most such states also declared secession from the United States and joined the Confederate States. American Civil War – civil war in the United States of America that lasted from 1861 to 1865.  Eleven Southern slave states declared their secession from the United States and formed the Confederate States of America, also known as ""the Confederacy.""  Led by Jefferson Davis, the Confederacy fought against the United States (the Union), which was supported by all the free states (where slavery had been abolished) and by five slave states that became known as the border states. George Washington Lafayette Bickley (1823 – August 1867) was the founder of the Knights of the Golden Circle, a Civil War era secret society used to promote the interests of the Southern United States by preparing the way for annexation of a ""golden circle"" of territories in Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean which would be included into the United States as southern or slave states. Bickley was arrested by the United States government and it was during this time he wrote a letter to Abraham Lincoln expressing his distastes with Lincoln's handling of the government. Texas secession movements principally focus on the secession of Texas during the American Civil War and the activities of organizations that have existed since the 1990s.  The United States Constitution does not address secession of states and the issue was a topic of debate from after the Revolutionary War up until the Civil War, when the Supreme Court ruled, in ""Texas v. White,"" that states cannot secede.  Texas claimed to be a sovereign state for nine years prior to the negotiated annexation with the United States, but its claim was not recognized by Mexico, nor did Texas actually control the entirety of its claimed territory.  This history has affected the state's politics ever since, including its standing in the Confederacy in the Civil War to education and even tourism in the 20th century.  Modern secession efforts have existed in the state at least since the 1990s, focusing first on the Republic of Texas organization founded by Richard Lance McLaren and later on the Texas Nationalist Movement headed by Daniel Miller. In the context of the American Civil War (1861–1865), the border states were slave states that did not declare a secession from the Union and did not join the Confederacy.  To their north they bordered free states of the Union and to their south they bordered Confederate slave states.  Of the 34 U.S. states in 1861, nineteen were free states and fifteen were slave states.  Four slave states never declared a secession: Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, and Missouri.  Four others did not declare secession until after the Battle of Fort Sumter and were briefly considered to be border states: Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia—after this, they were less frequently called “border states”."

Sweden is located in the very northern part of Europe between Norway and Finland, with edges touching the North Sea and the Baltic Sea.  Northern Sweden has a cold climate with year-round snow, while the more southern parts have a more temperate climate.  The country has an abundance of forests and mountains.  It holds the largest population, as well as the largest area within the Scandinavian countries.  Due to this, it has a strong influence over the rest of Norden.  Sweden, in turn, serves as the fashion capital of Scandinavia.  Sweden's capital, Stockholm, is the host of the country's biannual fashion week. Interstitial condensation is a form of structural damping that occurs when warm, moist air penetrates inside a wall, roof or floor structure, reaches the dew point and condenses into liquid water.  Interstitial condensation is differentiated from surface condensation in buildings sometimes called ""cold-bridge condensation"" or ""warm front condensation"" where the condensation forms on the interior or exterior surfaces of a building rather than inside the wall or roof cavities.  The warm, damp air may penetrate a wall from the inside of a heated building in a cold climate or from the exterior of an air-conditioned building in a warm climate.  This condensation may allow mold growth, rotting of timber, corrosion of metal components and/or a reduction in the thermal insulation's effectiveness.  The resulting structural damage may occur without visible indications until significant damage has occurred.  Most building materials are permeable so the common method of controlling interstitial condensation is to control indoor moisture at its sources or through dehumidification and/or ventilation and add an impermeable barrier on the warm side of the wall. The Kerguelen Islands are part of the Southern Indian Ocean Islands tundra ecoregion that includes several subantarctic islands.  In this cold climate plant life is mainly limited to grasses, mosses and lichens, although the islands are also known for the indigenous, edible Kerguelen cabbage."

Soil Inference System (SINFERS) is the term proposed by McBratney et al. (2002) as a knowledge base to infer soil properties and populate the digital soil databases.  SINFERS takes measurements with a given level of certainty and infers data that is not known with minimal uncertainties by means of logically linked predictive functions.  These predictive functions, in a non-spatial context are referred to as pedotransfer functions.  The basic assumption underlying SINFERS is that if one knows or is able to predict the basic fundamental properties of a soil, one should be able to infer all other physical and chemical properties using PTFs.  Pedotransfer functions relate basic soil properties to other more difficult or expensive to measure soil properties by means of regression and various data mining tools. Norbert Wiener (November 26, 1894 – March 18, 1964) was an American mathematician and philosopher.  He was a professor of mathematics at MIT.  A famous child prodigy, Wiener later became an early researcher in stochastic and mathematical noise processes, contributing work relevant to electronic engineering, electronic communication, and control systems. The Wiener filter as originally proposed by Norbert Wiener is a signal processing filter which uses knowledge of the statistical properties of both the signal and the noise to reconstruct an optimal estimate of the signal from a noisy one-dimensional time-ordered data stream.  The generalized Wiener filter generalizes the same idea beyond the domain of one-dimensional time-ordered signal processing, with two-dimensional image processing being the most common application. The Walking City was an idea proposed by British architect Ron Herron in 1964.  In an article in avant-garde architecture journal Archigram, Ron Herron proposed building massive mobile robotic structures, with their own intelligence, that could freely roam the world, moving to wherever their resources or manufacturing abilities were needed.  Various walking cities could interconnect with each other to form larger 'walking metropolises' when needed, and then disperse when their concentrated power was no longer necessary.  Individual buildings or structures could also be mobile, moving wherever their owner wanted or needs dictated. Callicles ( ; Greek: Καλλικλῆς ; c. 484 – late 5th century BCE) was an ancient Athenian political philosopher best remembered for his role in Plato’s dialogue ""Gorgias"", where he ""presents himself as a no-holds-barred, bare-knuckled, clear-headed advocate of ""Realpolitik"".  While he provides a counter-argument to Plato’s philosophical ideas, there is belief that he may be no more than a character created by Plato for the dialogue.  Another idea proposed is that Callicles is a fragment of what Plato may be, had he not Socrates to guide him.  He is the antithesis to Socrates.

Erick Friedman (August 14, 1939 – March 30, 2004) is considered by many as one of the greatest American born violinists of the past century.  Erick Friedman's illustrious career took him to many of the great concert stages of the world appearing as guest soloist with most of the great orchestras throughout the United States and abroad: the New York Philharmonic and the National Symphony, the orchestras of New Orleans, Pittsburgh, Miami, Detroit, Indianapolis, the Berlin Philharmonic, Orchestre de Paris and many other major orchestras throughout the world.  Karajan, Stokowski, Steinberg, Leinsdorf, Previn, and Ozawa are some of the celebrated conductors with whom he collaborated with.  Mr. Friedman's recordings for RCA Victor earned him accolades including the prestigious Grammy Award.  Mr. Friedman has been featured playing the Bartók Violin Concerto in an A&E Television Production on Bartók which was released worldwide.

In the early 1970s, Mr. Friedman was on the violin faculty of the North Carolina School of the Arts.  He later held faculty positions at the Manhattan School of Music, Southern Methodist University, and the Yale School of Music. A violin concerto is a concerto for solo violin (occasionally, two or more violins) and instrumental ensemble, customarily orchestra.  Such works have been written since the Baroque period, when the solo concerto form was first developed, up through the present day.  Many major composers have contributed to the violin concerto repertoire, with the best known works including those by Bach, Bartók, Walton, Beethoven, Brahms, Bruch, Mendelssohn, Mozart, Paganini, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, and Vivaldi.

Brian Wayne Transeau (born October 4, 1971), better known by his stage name BT, is an American music producer, composer, technologist, audio technician, multi-instrumentalist, singer, and songwriter.  An artist in the electronica music genre, he is credited as a pioneer of the trance and intelligent dance music styles that paved the way for EDM, and for ""stretching electronic music to its technical breaking point.""  He also creates music within many other styles, such as classical, film composition and bass music. A Song Across Wires (promoted by the hashtag #ASAW) is the ninth studio album by composer and electronica artist BT, released on August 16, 2013.  This album features more vocal tracks and a plethora of guest artists as part of his alternate instrumental and vocal album productions.  The album consists of 12 songs and was released in both digital and physical copies.  On the album, BT collaborates with singers and producers of his previous album, ""These Hopeful Machines"", such as Christian Burns and JES, as well as new ones, such as Arty, Nadia Ali, Aqualung, tyDi and more. This Binary Universe is the fifth studio album by composer and electronica artist BT and was released on August 29, 2006.

Paul v. Clinton was a civil suit filed in 2004 held in Los Angeles County Superior Court.  The plaintiff, Peter F. Paul, alleged that President Bill Clinton and his wife, First Lady Hillary Clinton, deceived him into paying for the Gala Hollywood Farewell Salute to President Clinton, during Hillary Clinton's first Senate race in 2000, by making a promise that the President would work for Paul's company, Stan Lee Media, after his presidential term was over.  Paul alleged that the President broke his promise and stole his business partner, causing his business to crumble and, further, that his contributions to Hillary Clinton's campaign were falsely reported to the Federal Election Commission.  Besides the Clintons, three other individuals who were involved in fundraising for the gala, were named as defendants in the suit. The Health Security Express was a 1994 series of 16 buses that traveled around the United States in groups to promote a 1993 plan for health care reform backed by Bill Clinton.  Then-U.S. President Clinton campaigned on a bus alongside his wife Hillary, Vice President Al Gore, and Tipper Gore.  The caravan was organized by health care reform supporters and various labor unions, who sponsored the buses at $20,000 each and were required to support health care reform legislation.  The Health Security Express was announced by Clinton health care supporters on July 12, 1994 and coordinated by John H. Hoyt, a Democratic activist.  The Health Security Express had a budget of $1.4 million–$1.9 million and was funded by donations ranging from $3,000 to over $100,000. During President Bill Clinton's first and second terms of office, he nominated 24 people for 20 federal appellate judgeships but the nominees were not processed by the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee.  Three of the nominees who were not processed (Christine Arguello, Andre M. Davis and S. Elizabeth Gibson) were nominated after July 1, 2000, the traditional start date of the unofficial Thurmond Rule during a presidential election year.  Democrats claim that Senate Republicans of the 106th Congress purposely tried to keep open particular judgeships as a political maneuver to allow a future Republican president to fill them.  Of the 20 seats in question, four were eventually filled with different Clinton nominees, fourteen were later filled with Republican nominees by President George W. Bush and two continued to stay open during Bush's presidency.  Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader of the United States Senate during the 110th Congress, and Senator Patrick Leahy, the Democratic leader of the Senate Judiciary Committee under Reid, repeatedly mentioned the controversy over President Clinton's court of appeals nominees during the controversy involving the confirmation of Republican court of appeals nominees during the last two years of Bush's second term.  Republicans claimed that Democrats were refusing to confirm certain longstanding Bush nominees in order to allow a future Democratic president in 2009 to fill those judgeships.

It was built and demonstrated at College Park, Maryland at the same airfield that the Wright Brothers trained pilots using their aircraft for the U.S. Army Signal Corps just North of Washington D.C.  This followed the initial demonstration at Fort Myer, Virginia in 1908 and 1909 when the U.S. Army Signal Corps accepted the Wright Flyer in July, 1909.

Abdül Kadir was a pre-dreadnought battleship laid down in 1892 at the Constantinople imperial dockyard for the Ottoman Navy, the first vessel of this type to be ordered by the Ottoman Empire.  The ship was the first capital ship to be laid down by the Ottomans in more than a decade.  She was to have a main armament of four 28 cm guns, with an armoured belt that was 230 mm thick.  Work proceeded on the ship very slowly, primarily the result of a lack of funds; after two years, only the frames for the hull had been erected, and by the time work stopped in 1906, the hull had been only partially plated.  The unfinished ship was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1909. An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft.  Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations.  Aircraft carriers are expensive to build and are critical assets.  Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighter planes, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft.  While it is possible to launch heavier aircraft such as fixed-wing gunships and bombers (it has been done) from aircraft carriers, it is virtually impossible to land them. The Curtiss F7C Seahawk was a carrier-capable biplane fighter aircraft of the United States Navy Marine Corps in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The Curtiss No. 2, often known as the Reims Racer, was a racing aircraft built in the United States by Glenn Curtiss in 1909 to contest the Gordon Bennett Cup air race in Reims, France that year.  It was a modified Golden Flyer, and was an open-framework biplane with two-bay unstaggered wings of equal span.  It had a monoplane tail that controlled the rudder but the elevators were carried forward of the pilot as a biplane canard unit.  The landing gear was wheeled and tricycle in configuration, with each unit carrying a single wheel.  Large ailerons were carried in the interplane gap."

The uprising took place during the last phase of the Occupation of Araucanía (1861–1883) by the Chilean state.  The uprising was planned by Mapuche chiefs in March 1881 to be launched in November of the same year.  Mapuche support for the uprising was not unanimous, some Mapuche factions sided with the Chileans and others declared themselves neutral.

By thus dismissing the government of Palmela, that had only come to power 5 months earlier, and replacing it with a Cartista government (described as government of the Cabrais without Cabral) presided over by João Francisco de Saldanha Oliveira e Daun, 1st Duke of Saldanha, the monarch rekindled the revolt and precipitated the civil war known as the Patuleia.

Like many medieval English princes, Edmund gained his nickname from his birthplace: Kings Langley Palace in Hertfordshire.  He was the founder of the House of York, but it was through the marriage of his younger son, Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge, to Anne de Mortimer, great-granddaughter of Edmund's elder brother Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, that the House of York made its claim to the English throne in the Wars of the Roses.

The Revolution of Maria da Fonte, or Revolution of the Minho, is the name given to a popular revolt in the spring of 1846 against the Cartista government of Portugal (presided over by António Bernardo da Costa Cabral, 1st Marquess of Tomar).  The revolt resulted from social tensions remaining from the Liberal Wars, exacerbated by great popular discontent generated by new military recruitment laws, fiscal alterations and the prohibition on burials inside churches.  It began in the area of Póvoa de Lanhoso (Minho) by a popular uprising that little by little extended to the whole north of Portugal.  The instigator of the initial riots was a woman called Maria, native of the freguesia of Fontarcada, who would become known by the nickname of Maria da Fonte.  As the initial phase of the insurrection had a strong female element, she ended up giving her name to the revolt."

In North America, a bowl game is one of a number of post-season college football games that are primarily played by teams belonging to the NCAA's Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS).  Prior to 2002, bowl game statistics were not included in players' career totals and the games were mostly considered to be exhibition games involving a payout to participating teams.  While teams once had to meet strict bowl eligibility requirements to receive an invitation to a bowl game, the number of bowl games has grown in recent years, climbing to 40 team-competitive games (not including the College Football Playoff National Championship) starting in the 2015–16 bowl season, although this number will drop to 39 in the 2017–18 bowl season.  The increase in bowl games has necessitated the steady easing of the NCAA bowl eligibility rules since 2006, as teams with a losing record are often required to fill some of the 78 available bowl slots.

The 1929–30 season saw Hull relegated to the Third Division North after 21 seasons in the Second Division while reaching the semi-final of the FA Cup, where they were beaten by Arsenal after a replay.  Promotion back to the Second Division was achieved three years later, with the Third Division North championship becoming the club's first major honour.  However, they were relegated in the 1935–36 season and it was 13 years before another return to the Second Division was made, when, under the player-management of former England international Raich Carter, the Third Division North title was won.  Relegation back to this division came in the 1955–56 season and following League reorganisation implemented for the 1958–59 season Hull won promotion in the Third Division's inaugural season, although they were relegated after one year.

The chart was established in June 1985 and originally listed the top twenty-five best-selling albums of mariachi, tejano, norteño, banda and duranguense, which are frequently considered regional Mexican.  The genre is considered by musicologist as being ""the biggest-selling Latin music genre in the United States"", and represented the fastest ever growing Latin genre in the United States after tejano music entered the mainstream market during its 1990s golden age.  Originally, ""Billboard"" based their methodology on sales surveys it sent out to record stores across the United States and by 1991 began monitoring point-of-sales compiled from Nielsen Soundscan.  Musicologist and critics have since criticized the sales data compiled from Nielsen, finding that the company only provides sales from larger music chains than from small shops that specialized in Latin music—where the majority of Latin music sales are generated.  The magazine decided to rank Latin music recordings in August 1970 under the title Hot Latin LPs, which only ranked the best-selling Latin albums in Los Angeles (Pop) and the East Coast (Salsa).  Before the chart's inception, musicians' only chart success was the Texas Latin LPs (formerly the San Antonio Latin LPs) section where regional Mexican music was more prominent.

A defined benefit pension plan is a type of pension plan in which an employer/sponsor promises a specified pension payment, lump-sum (or combination thereof) on retirement that is predetermined by a formula based on the employee's earnings history, tenure of service and age, rather than depending directly on individual investment returns.  Traditionally, many governmental and public entities, as well as a large number of corporations, provided defined benefit plans, sometimes as a means of compensating workers in lieu of increased pay.  A defined benefit plan is 'defined' in the sense that the benefit formula is defined and known in advance.

A traditional pension plan that ""defines"" a ""benefit"" for an employee upon that employee's retirement is a defined benefit plan. A third-party administrator (TPA) is an organization that processes insurance claims or certain aspects of employee benefit plans for a separate entity.  It is also a term used to define organizations within the Insurance industry which ""administer"" other services such as Underwriting, Customer Service and the like.  This can be viewed as ""outsourcing"" the administration of the claims processing, since the TPA is performing a task traditionally handled by the company providing the insurance or the company itself.  Often, in the case of insurance claims, a TPA handles the claims processing for an employer that self-insures its employees.  Thus, the employer is acting as an insurance company and underwrites the risk.  The risk of loss remains with the employer, and not with the TPA.  An insurance company may also use a TPA to manage its claims processing, provider networks, utilization review, or membership functions.  While some third-party administrators may operate as units of insurance companies, they are often independent. MetLife, Inc. is the holding corporation for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MLIC), better known as MetLife, and its affiliates.

Hampi (""Hampe"") is a historic temple town recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, listed as the ""Group of Monuments at Hampi"".  Located in northern Karnataka, India close to the Andhra Pradesh border and near the city of Hosapete, Hampi was established as the capital of the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire in the 14th-century.  Chronicles left by Persian and European travelers particularly the Portuguese state Hampi as a prosperous, wealthy and grand city near the Tungabhadra river with numerous temples, farms and trading markets.  The Vijayanagara Empire was defeated by a coalition of Muslim Sultanates, its capital Hampi was conquered, pillaged and badly damaged by Sultanate armies in 1565, after which Hampi remained in ruins. The antiquity of Architecture of Karnataka(Kannada: ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ ವಾಸ್ತುಶಿಲ್ಪ ) can be traced to its southern Neolithic and early Iron Age, Having witnessed the architectural ideological and utilitarian transformation from shelter- ritual- religion.  Here the nomenclature ‘Architecture’ is as old as c.2000 B.C.E.  The upper or late Neolithic people in order to make their shelters, they constructed huts made of wattle and doab, that were buttressed by stone boulders, presumably having conical roof resting on the bamboo or wooden posts into red murram or paved granite chips as revealed in archaeological excavations in sites like Brhamagiri (Chitradurga district), Sanganakallu, Tekkalakota (Bellary district), Piklihal (Raichur district).  Megaliths are the dominant archaeological evidence of the early Iron Age (c. 1500 B.C.E- 100 C.E unsettled date).  There are more than 2000 early Iron Age burial sites on record, who laid the foundation for a high non perishable architecture in the form of various distinct architectural styles of stone built burials, which are ritualistic in its character.  The active religious architecture is evident 345 with that of the Kadamba Dynasty.  Karnataka is a state in the southern part of India originally known as the State of Mysore.  Over the centuries, architectural monuments within the region displayed a diversity of influences, often relaying much about the artistic trends of the rulers of twelve different dynasties.  Its architecture ranges dramatically from majestic monolith, such as the Gomateshwara, to Hindu and Jain places of worship, ruins of ancient cities, mausoleums and palaces of different architectural hue.  Mysore Kingdom (Wodeyar) rule has also given an architectural master structure in the St. Philomena's Church at Mysore (extolled by the King as a structure of divine compassion and the eager gratitude of men) which was completed in 1956, in addition to many Dravidian style architectural temples.  Two of the monuments (Pattadakal and Hampi) are listed under the UNESCO World Heritage List of 22 cultural monuments in India.

Ryan replaced Doug Marrone, who opted out of his contract on December 31, 2014 to take advantage of a contract loophole, fearing the Pegulas were going to fire him, hence the reason the Bills entered the 2015 season looking for a new head coach.  Despite the bold prediction made by Ryan at his introductory press conference, where he stated, “I’m not going to let our fans down.  I am not going to do that.  I know it’s been 15 years since the Bills made the playoffs.  Well, get ready, man, we’re going.  We are going,” the Bills were unable to make the playoffs in their first season with Ryan as head coach, finishing with a record of 8-8 (the team’s first since 2002), making it the 16th straight season without a playoff appearance, which became the longest active in major professional sports after Major League Baseball’s Toronto Blue Jays broke their 22-year playoff drought on September 25, 2015.  It was also the first full season under the ownership of Terry and Kim Pegula (whom also own the Buffalo Sabres), having purchased the Bills partway through 2014 after the death of longtime owner Ralph Wilson in March at the age of 95.  The Bills began their season with an open competition for the starting quarterback position after Kyle Orton, the starter for most of the 2014 campaign, retired during the offseason, so the team acquired free agent Tyrod Taylor, a former backup quarterback of the Baltimore Ravens, who won the competition over incumbent second-string quarterback EJ Manuel and trade acquisition Matt Cassel, the latter of whom the team later traded along with a seventh-round pick in 2017 to the Dallas Cowboys, in exchange for a fifth-round draft pick in 2017.

He is the Emeritus Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at the Mathematical Institute of the University of Oxford, as well as an Emeritus Fellow of Wadham College. Twistor string theory is an equivalence between N = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory and the perturbative topological B model string theory in twistor space. In differential geometry, the local twistor bundle is a specific vector bundle with connection that can be associated to any conformal manifold, at least locally.  Intuitively, a local twistor is an association of a twistor space to each point of space-time, together with a conformally invariant connection that relates the twistor spaces at different points.  This connection can have holonomy that obstructs the existence of ""global"" twistors (that is, solutions of the twistor equation in open sets). The Rouse Ball Professorship of Mathematics is one of the senior chairs in the Mathematics Departments at the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford.  The two positions were founded in 1927 by a bequest from the mathematician W. W. Rouse Ball.  At Cambridge, this bequest was made with the ""hope (but not making it in any way a condition) that it might be found practicable for such Professor or Reader to include in his or her lectures and treatment historical and philosophical aspects of the subject."" In mathematics, twistor space is the complex vector space of solutions of the twistor equation formula_1.  It was described in the 1960s by Roger Penrose and Malcolm MacCallum.  According to Andrew Hodges, twistor space is useful for conceptualizing the way photons travel through space, using four complex numbers.  He also posits that twistor space may aid in understanding the asymmetry of the weak nuclear force. In mathematical physics, the Penrose transform, introduced by , is a complex analogue of the Radon transform that relates massless fields on spacetime to cohomology of sheaves on complex projective space.  The projective space in question is the twistor space, a geometrical space naturally associated to the original spacetime, and the twistor transform is also geometrically natural in the sense of integral geometry.  The Penrose transform is a major component of classical twistor theory. The Rouse Ball Professorship of English Law is one of the senior professorships in English Law at the University of Cambridge, and was founded in 1927 by a bequest from the mathematician Rouse Ball. Henry Arthur Hollond DSO OBE (1884-1974) was Rouse Ball Professor of English Law in the University of Cambridge from 1943 to 18 November 1950.  He is author of ""English Legal Authors Before Blackstone"", first published as a periodical article under the title ""English Legal Authors Before 1700"" at 9 Cambridge Law Journal 292, and then reprinted separately in 42 pages by Stevens & Sons Limited in 1947.

It is listed as being of least concern by the IUCN on account of its widespread range and large numbers estimated between 27,000 and 47,000 individuals.  The species is, however, experiencing declines outside of protected areas due to habitat loss and poaching.  The species may have originated in Asia, and once ranged throughout Europe for at least one million years until the end of the Late Pleistocene.  The spotted hyena is the largest known member of the Hyaenidae, and is further physically distinguished from other species by its vaguely bear-like build, its rounded ears, its less prominent mane, its spotted pelt, its more dual purposed dentition, its fewer nipples and the presence of a pseudo-penis in the female.  It is the only mammalian species to lack an external vaginal opening.

Born in Sydney and raised in Mullumbimby, she moved to the United States at the age of 16 to pursue a career in hip hop music, residing in the southern part of the country.  She earned public recognition after releasing music videos for her songs ""Pu$$y"" and ""Two Times"" on YouTube.  She signed a recording contract with American rapper T.I.'s Grand Hustle Records imprint in 2012, after gaining attention from her first full-length project, a mixtape titled ""Ignorant Art"". Hip hop music, also called hip-hop or rap music, is a music genre developed in the United States by inner-city African Americans in the 1970s which consists of a stylized rhythmic music that commonly accompanies rapping, a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted.  It developed as part of hip hop culture, a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements: MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching with turntables, break dancing, and graffiti writing.  Other elements include sampling beats or bass lines from records (or synthesized beats and sounds), and rhythmic beatboxing.  While often used to refer solely to rapping, ""hip hop"" more properly denotes the practice of the entire subculture.  The term ""hip hop music"" is sometimes used synonymously with the term ""rap music"", though rapping is not a required component of hip hop music; the genre may also incorporate other elements of hip hop culture, including DJing, turntablism, scratching, beatboxing, and instrumental tracks.

Turkish hip hop refers to hip hop music produced by members of the Turkish minority in Germany, and to a lesser degree by hip hop artists in Turkey.  The Turkish minority, called the Turks, first drew inspiration from the discrimination and racism they received while living as migrant workers in Germany beginning in the 1960s.  Turkish hip hop uses Arabesk music, a folk style that finds its roots in Turkey during the 1960s, and is influenced by the hip hop music of America and Germany.  Album artwork, lyrical content, and the Turkish language are used by hip hop artists to express their uniquely Turkish identity. Indonesian hip hop is hip hop music performed in Indonesia.  Hip hop music began to be produced in Indonesia in the early 1990s, with the first Indonesia artist to release a full-length hip hop album being the emcee Iwa K, who has released five albums to date."

Indigenous people have a long history of collaborating on the creation of video games.  It has only been with the release of Never Alone though that broad media attention has been paid to these projects.  There have been a growing number of game gatherings and community organizing around indigenous games happening in the United States and Canada.  Indigenous creators of video games have been featured in the DIGITAL MEDIA ART+CADE as part of imagineNATIVE and in ""Memories of the Future/Souvenirs du futur"" at SAW Video Media Art Centre in Ottawa.  Many early video games that depicted native people were often racist and perpetuated negative stereotypes (see Custer's Revenge).  Video games created by indigenous people allow the creators to self-determine how they are represented and they allow indigenous people to picture themselves in the future."

The victims were collaborators with the Korean People's Army during North Korean rule.  Before this massacre, 140 people were executed in Ganghwa in what is known as the Bodo League massacre in 1950. The Paramythia executions, also known as the Paramythia massacre (19–29 September 1943) was a combined Nazi and Cham Albanian war crime perpetrated by members of the 1st Mountain Division and the Muslim Cham militia in the town of Paramythia and its surrounding region, during the Axis occupation of Greece.  201 Greek villagers were murdered and 19 municipalities in the region of Paramythia were destroyed.  The years after the war, a series a war crime trials condemned these actions, however not a single defendant was ever arrested and brought to trial.  At the Hostages Trial in Nuremberg (1948) the American judges reached the decision that the executions of Paramythia were ""plain murders"". 1991 Rudrapur bombings were bombings by the suspected terrorists in 1991 in Rudrapur town in Indian state of Uttarakhand.  Two bombs were exploded on 17 October 1991.  The first bomb exploded when people were watching Ramlila in the public ground.  After 15 minutes the second bomb went off near the hospital where injured were being taken.  The bombings killed more than 40 people and injuring 140 people.  Later BSTK and the Khalistan National Army claimed the responsibility for the bombings. The Lottery of Huruslahti (Finnish: ""Huruslahden arpajaiset"" ) occurred in Varkaus, Finland, and classified as a war crime in the Finnish Civil War, in which approximately 90 ""Red"" prisoners were executed by the White troops, after the Battle of Varkaus in 1918.  It was the first application of the ""shoot on the spot"" proclamation, which ordered that all Red leaders, agitators, saboteurs caught red-handed, and whoever had actually participated in violence should be shot without trial, defining this as justifiable homicide rather than a death sentence.  It was claimed by the Reds that the White troops, after the battle of Varkaus, ordered all the captured Reds to assemble in a single row on the ice of Huruslahti, selected first all leaders and then every fifth prisoner, and executed them on the spot.  However, although the number executed was 10% if the accused, the Whites individually selected each victim based on known identities and acts of violence rather than randomly.  Furthermore, the condemned were first separated from the rest and then shot in groups of five."

The Australian-Croatian Soccer Tournament is a tournament run by the Croatian Soccer Federation of Australia and New Zealand, an organisation founded in 1974.  The inspiration for the tournament came from the successful Croatian-North American Soccer Tournament founded in 1964.  The Australian tournament kicked off in 1974 with an event staged in Melbourne, Australia where six soccer clubs participated at Melbourne Croatia's ground Montgomery Park in Essendon.  The tournament was born.  Although only six clubs participated, it was the beginning, a beginning spawned from Croatia Melbourne's expulsion from the Victorian Soccer Federation, with the clubs leadership including Tony Vrzina and Josip Solic together with Mirko Furjanic the now Honorary President of the Australian Croatian Soccer Tournament being the forerunners in getting the tournament up and going.  The second tournament was staged in 1975, hosted by Sydney Croatia and taken out by Canberra FC who defeated Sydney Croatia 3-1 in the Final.  Since then it has gone on to become the largest and oldest ethnic football tournament in Australia, having been hosted in every state and territory except for the Northern Territory.  It also holds the honour of being the oldest national soccer competition still running in Australia. The 1986 Gay Games (Gay Games II) were held in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia from October 4-October 29, 1986. The Gay Games is the world's largest sporting and cultural event specifically for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) athletes, artists and musicians, founded by Tom Waddell, Rikki Streicher, and others.

The Federation of Gay Games (FGG) is the sanctioning body of the Gay Games which was founded in 1982 by Tom Waddell, after he dealt first-hand with the prejudice towards gay athletes and their inability to openly participate in sporting events.  The Federation of Gay Games hosts the world's biggest cultural and sporting event for the LGBT community every four years.  The Federation of Gay Games is founded on the principles of ""participation, inclusion, and personal best"" and continues to support the LGBT community not only through the Gay Games but through scholarships for underprivileged members."

Located almost entirely in Ohio County, of which it is the county seat, it lies along the Ohio River in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.  Wheeling was originally a settlement in the British colony of Virginia and later an important city in the Commonwealth of Virginia.  Wheeling was the first state capital of West Virginia.  Due to its location along major transportation routes, including the Ohio River, National Road, and the B&O Railroad, Wheeling became a manufacturing center in the late nineteenth century.  After experiencing the closing of factories and substantial population loss following World War II, Wheeling's major industries now include healthcare, education, law and legal services, entertainment and tourism, and energy.

The film is an adaptation of William Shakespeare's play ""The Merchant of Venice"".  It was released in the United States in 1926 as The Jew of Mestri.  The film was made on location in Venice, with scenes and characters added which were not in the original play.  This is the surviving copy, being two reels shorter than the German version.  The characters in the German retained Shakespeare’s nomenclature, but in the American they were given new names sourced from the Italian work ""Il Pecorone"", a 14th-century short story collection attributed to Giovanni Fiorentino, from which Shakespeare is believed to have drawn his idea.  The film purports to be a return to the original, as an excuse for its differences from the play. ""Let's kill all the lawyers"" is a line from William Shakespeare's ""Henry VI, Part 2"", Act IV, Scene 2.  The full quote is ""The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers"".  This quote is among one of Shakespeare's most famous quotes, as well as one of his most controversial quotes.  The quote has been the title of movies as well as the title for published books.  Shakespeare may be making a joke when character ""Dick The Butcher"" suggests one of the ways the band of pretenders to the throne can improve the country is to kill all the lawyers.  Dick is a rough character, a killer as evil as his name implies, like the other henchmen, and this is his rough solution to his perceived societal problem.  There is some disagreement with the interpretation that one of Shakespeare's sympathetic characters would make a joke suggesting that killing lawyers would make the world better.  The Florida Bar Association contends the quote was a lawyer joke. Portia is the heroine of William Shakespeare's ""The Merchant of Venice"".  A rich, beautiful, and intelligent heiress, she is bound by the lottery set forth in her father's will, which gives potential suitors the chance to choose between three caskets composed of gold, silver and lead.  If they choose the right casket – the casket containing Portia's portrait and a scroll– they win Portia's hand in marriage.  If they choose the wrong casket, they must leave and never seek another woman in marriage.  Portia is glad when two suitors, one driven by greed and another by vanity, fail to choose correctly."

Leaders of the strike, including Rose Pesotta and other members of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU), organized the strike to be culturally orientated in order to include Mexican immigrant workers to fight for union recognition in the garment industry. The Carbon County Strikes took place in Carbon County, Utah from 1903–1904.  The strikes primarily consisted of Slavic and Italian immigrant mine workers who partnered with the United Mine Workers of America strikes in Colorado to protest the dangerous working conditions of the Utah coal mines.  The Carbon County strikes were considered the most important labor confrontation in the United States at the time.  The Utah Fuel Company strongly opposed initiatives to unionize coal workers in Utah and were the primary opposition to the UMWA at the time.  The Carbon County Strikes would ultimately fail in its attempt to unionize the coal workers of Utah simply because it ""did not have enough support, either internally or externally, to win against a powerful and influential company that effectively played on radical, anti-foreign sentiments in defending its position"" but it demonstrated a significant nationwide effort in strengthening unionization in the west."

October 22] September 26, 1820) was an American pioneer, explorer, woodsman, and frontiersman, whose frontier exploits made him one of the first folk heroes of the United States.  Boone is most famous for his exploration and settlement of what is now Kentucky, which was then part of Virginia but on the other side of the mountains from the settled areas.  As a young adult, Boone supplemented his farm income by hunting and trapping game, and selling their pelts in the fur market.  Through this occupational interest, Boone first learned the easy routes to the area.  Despite some resistance from American Indian tribes such as the Shawnee, in 1775, Boone blazed his Wilderness Road through the Cumberland Gap in the Appalachian Mountains from North Carolina and Tennessee into Kentucky.  There, he founded the village of Boonesborough, Kentucky, one of the first American settlements west of the Appalachians.  Before the end of the 18th century, more than 200,000 Americans migrated to Kentucky/Virginia by following the route marked by Boone. Oley Township is a township in Berks County, Pennsylvania, United States.  As of the 2010 census, the township had a population of 3,620.  Oley Township was originally formed in 1740 as a part of Philadelphia County, before Berks County was formed in 1752.  The entire township was listed as a historic district by the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.  Daniel Boone was born in Oley Township November 2, 1734. The Siege of Boonesborough took place in September 1778 during the American Revolutionary War.  The attack on the Kentucky settlement of Boonesborough was led by Chief Blackfish, a Shawnee leader allied to the British.  Months before the battle, Blackfish had captured and adopted Daniel Boone, the founder of Boonesborough.  Boone escaped the Shawnees in time to lead the defense of the settlement.  Blackfish's siege was unsuccessful and was lifted after ten days.  Boone was then court-martialed by fellow officers who suspected him of having British sympathies.  Boone was acquitted, but he soon moved away from Boonesborough. Peter Hackett was born in approximately 1763 or 1764 in the English colony of Virginia."

Since the late 1970s, Pärt has worked in a minimalist style that employs his self-invented compositional technique, tintinnabuli.  Pärt's music is in part inspired by Gregorian chant.  His most performed works include ""Fratres"" (1977), ""Spiegel im Spiegel"" (1978), and ""Für Alina"" (1976).  Pärt has been the most performed living composer in the world for five consecutive years. Artur Lemba (24 September 1885, Tallinn – 21 November 1963, Tallinn) was an Estonian composer and piano teacher, and one of the most important figures in Estonian classical music.  Artur and his older brother Theodor (1876-1962) were the first professional pianists in Estonia to give concerts abroad.  Artur's 1905 opera ""Sabina"" was the first opera composed by an Estonian.  His Symphony No. 1 in 1908 was the first symphony composed by an Estonian. Te Deum is a setting of the Latin Te Deum text, also known as the Ambrosian Hymn attributed to Saints Ambrose, Augustine, and Hilary, by Estonian-born composer Arvo Pärt, commissioned by the Westdeutscher Rundfunk in Cologne, Germany, in 1984.  Dedicated to the late Alfred Schlee of Universal Edition, the WDR Broadcast Choir premiered the Te Deum under the direction of conductor Dennis Russell Davies on January 19, 1985.  The Te Deum plays an important role in the services of many Christian denominations, including the Paraklesis (Moleben) of Thanksgiving in the Eastern Orthodox Church.  Because of the unusual instrumentation Pärt employs, his Te Deum is not suited for use within the Orthodox Church.  It was recorded on the ECM New Series label in 1993 by the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir and Tallinn Chamber Orchestra under the direction of Tõnu Kaljuste.  The piece is approximately thirty minutes long. The Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir (EPCC) is a professional choir based in Estonia.  It was founded in 1981 by Tõnu Kaljuste, who was its conductor for twenty years.  In 2001, Paul Hillier followed Kaljuste's tenure, becoming the EPCC's principal conductor and artistic director until September 2008, when Daniel Reuss took over the task.  The repertoire of the EPCC ranges from Gregorian Chant to modern works, particularly those of the Estonian composers Arvo Pärt and Veljo Tormis.  The group has been nominated for numerous Grammy Awards, and has won the Grammy Award for Best Choral Performance twice: in 2007 with Arvo Pärt's ""Da pacem"" and in 2014 with Pärt's ""Adam's Lament"", the latter was shared with Tui Hirv & Rainer Vilu, Sinfonietta Riga & Tallinn Chamber Orchestra; Latvian Radio Choir & Vox Clamantis."

Prior to European colonization, the Pokanoket were the leadership of the tribal groups that make up the modern-day Wampanoag Nation.  However, ethnically Pokanoket groups and their neighbors did not begin to refer to themselves as Wampanoag until after King Philip's War, when Pokanoket identity was criminalized in Rhode Island and Massachusetts.  Thus, while all Pokanoket are Wampanoag (being one tribe among several), not all Wampanoag are ethnically Pokanoket.  The Pokanoket are the indigenous group in the first Thanksgiving story, although it is speculated that no meal was actually shared between the Pokanoket and English settlers, and the former did not necessarily welcome colonization. The son of Shoshenq I and his chief consort, Karomat A, Osorkon I was the second king of Egypt's 22nd Dynasty and ruled around 922 BC – 887 BC.  He succeeded his father Shoshenq I who probably died within a year of his successful 923 BC campaign against the kingdoms of Israel and Judah.  Osorkon I's reign is known for many temple building projects and was a long and prosperous period of Egypt's History.  His highest known date is a ""Year 33"" date found on the bandage of Nakhtefmut's Mummy which held a menat-tab necklace inscribed with Osorkon I's nomen and praenomen: ""Osorkon Sekhemkheperre"".  This date can only belong to Osorkon I since no other early Dynasty 22 king ruled for close to 30 years until the time of Osorkon II.  Other mummy linens which belong to his reign include three separate bandages dating to his Regnal Years 11, 12, and 23 on the mummy of Khonsmaakheru in Berlin.  The bandages are anonymously dated but definitely belong to his reign because Khonsmaakheru wore leather bands that contained a ""menat-tab"" naming Osorkon I. Secondly, no other king who ruled around Osorkon I's reign had a 23rd Regnal Year including Shoshenq I who died just before the beginning of his Year 22. Shar-Kali-Sharri (""Shar-Gani-Sharri""; r. c. 2217-2193 BC middle chronology, c. 2153-2129 BC short chronology) was a king of the Akkadian Empire.  Succeeding his father Naram-Sin in c. 2217 BC, he came to the throne in an age of increasing troubles.  The raids of the Gutian hill peoples of the Zagros mountains that began in his father's reign were becoming more and more frequent, and he was faced with a number of rebellions from vassal kings against the high taxes they were forced to pay to fund the defence against the Gutian threat.  Sumer also suffered from a terrible drought during Shar-Kali-Sharri's reign in about c. 2200 BC, leading to the complete abandonment of some cities.  This is complementary to Egyptian records, which suggest there was a drought around the same time during the reign of king Pepi II.  After Shar-Kali-Sharri’s death in c. 2193 BC, Sumer fell into anarchy, with no king able to achieve dominance for long.  The king list states: Suhung (reign 1674–1675 CE) was a king of Ahom kingdom who ruled for a very short period."

After United States Navy had evacuated the camp at the end of the war, local people living in over-crowded terraced homes, sometimes three families living in one small house, broke into the camp and ""squatted"" in to the huts in August 1946.  The huts although without running water, electricity or any means of heating, they still provided the families with space, which was lacking in their previous homes.  After a public outcry the Londonderry Corporation who were unionist/Protestant in the majority and who only obtained power by vote gerrymandering, granted ""temporary"" rentals to the new occupants and charged rent.  This agreement was supposed to last 6 months after which the families were to be housed in proper house in Derry City.  But this never happened due to discrimination, as the residents of Springtown Camp were over 90% catholic/nationalist. The quality of the accommodation was poor, however, and over time, children grew up, married and were obliged to live with parents, resulting in over-crowding.  The conditions, in the tin huts deteriorated due to lack of repairs and became very unsafe, led to a sustained campaign for rehousing.  The Corporation resisted this campaign for years but after a ""silent"" protest march by the residents from the camp to Derry's Guildhall was televised and beamed in to many homes throughout Ireland, pressure was mounting on the Londonderry Corporation to act.They again refused to re house the people of the camp, fearing the movement of so many catholic/nationalist to different areas of Derry could jeopardise their grip on power.  However the residents protest gained so much support the Londonderry Corporation was forced to move on the rehousing of the people.

Gerold (died 799) was an Alamannian nobleman who served the Frankish King, Charlemagne, as Margrave of the Avarian March and Prefect of Bavaria in what is now South-Eastern Germany.  Gerold played a significant role in the integration of Bavaria into the Frankish Kingdom during Carolingian expansion in the late 8th, and early 9th centuries.  Gerold both aided the continuity of Agilofing rule of Bavaria, as well as took steps to integrate Bavarians into the wider scope of the Frankish Kingdom.  Gerold was related both to the Agilofing family, the ruling class of Bavaria, as well as the Carolingian family.  The Agilofings had ruled Bavaria since Duke Garibald I in 548.  Gerold was born into the Agilofings, and his sister Hildegard was married to Charlemagne in 771. From these familial connections, he was appointed Prefect of Bavaria following the deposition of Duke Tassilo III in 788.  Gerold was heralded as a superb military commander, giving rise to his promotion to Prefect as a defender of the eastern border of the Frankish Kingdom.  In 799, Gerold is said to have fallen in battle against the Avars, shortly after the same Avars killed his ally, Erich, Duke of Friuli, through treachery.

He received the Distinguished Service Cross from General George S. Patton, thus becoming the first Puerto Rican recipient of said military decoration.  PFC Joseph Martinez was the first Puerto Rican U.S. Army soldier to be awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. The Battle of Qala-i-Jangi (also incorrectly referred to as the ""Battle of Mazar-i-Sharif"") was a prisoner-of-war camp uprising that took place between November 25 and December 1, 2001, in northern Afghanistan, following the armed intervention by United States-led coalition forces to try to overthrow the Taliban's Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, which it had accused of harboring al-Qaeda operatives. Billy Walkabout (March 31, 1949 – March 7, 2007) is thought to be the most decorated Native American soldier of the Vietnam War.  He received the Distinguished Service Cross, five Silver Stars (one upgraded to a Distinguished Service Cross), ten Bronze Star Medal five with Valor device, one Army Commendation Medals (including one valor device and two oak leaf clusters), and six Purple Hearts. The Distinguished Service Cross is the second highest military award that can be given to a member of the United States Army (and previously, the United States Army Air Forces and the United States Air Force), for extreme gallantry and risk of life in actual combat with an armed enemy force.  Actions that merit the Distinguished Service Cross must be of such a high degree that they are above those required for all other U.S. combat decorations but do not meet the criteria for the Medal of Honor.  The Distinguished Service Cross is equivalent to the Navy Cross (Navy and Marine Corps), the Air Force Cross (Air Force), and the Coast Guard Cross (Coast Guard)."

Feronia or Lucus Feroniae (Φερωνία , Strabo; Λοῦκος Φηρωνίας , Ptolemy) was an ancient town of southern Etruria, at the foot of Mount Soracte, within the territory of Capena, with a celebrated temple or shrine of the goddess from whom it derived its name, and a sacred grove, attached to it.  Strabo, indeed, is the only author who mentions a town of the name, which he calls Feronia; other writers speak of Lucus Feroniae and Feroniae fanum, but it is natural that in process of time a town should have grown up around a site of so much sanctity, and which was annually visited by a great concourse of persons.  Feronia appears to have been a Sabine goddess, and hence the festivals at her shrine seem to have been attended especially by the Sabines, though the sanctuary itself was in the Etruscan territory, and dependent upon the neighbouring city of Capena The first mention of these annual festivals occurs as early as the reign of Tullus Hostilius, when we find them already frequented by great numbers of people, not only for religious objects, but as a kind of fair for the purposes of trade, a custom which seems to have prevailed at all similar meetings.  Great wealth had, in the course of ages, been accumulated at the shrine of Feronia, and this tempted Hannibal to make a digression from his march during his retreat from Rome, in 211 BCE, for the purpose of plundering the temple.  On this occasion he despoiled it of all its gold and silver, amounting to a large sum, besides which there was a large quantity of rude or uncoined brass, a sufficient proof of the antiquity of the sanctuary.  The only other notices of the spot which occur in history are some casual mentions of prodigies that occurred there; but Strabo tells that it was still much frequented in his time, and that many persons came thither to see the miracle of the priests and votaries of the goddess passing unharmed through a fire and over burning cinders.  This superstition is ascribed by other writers to the temple of Apollo, on the summit of Mount Soracte.  It was probably transferred from thence to the more celebrated sanctuary at its foot. The American Widener family of Peter Arrell Brown Widener (1834–1915) and his wife Hannah Josephine Dunton (1836–1896) were from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and were one of the wealthiest families in the United States.

Sunnen, 333 U.S. 591 (1948), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1948 in which the Court outlined the scope of collateral estoppel or estoppel by judgment in determinations of federal tax liability.  This was important because a single controversial circumstance may have a bearing on income tax liability for several years.  Res judicata, as part of the doctrine of judicial finality, protects a taxpayer's tax liability for a given year once the taxpayer wins a judgment in court.  The judgment is controlling not only controlling with regard to the issues litigated but also with any issues that ""could have"" been raised if they would have affected the determination of tax liability for the year.  However, of course, a single controversial circumstance may have a bearing on income tax liability for several years, and if a judgment fixes liability for one of the years, res judiciary forecloses the reopening of only that year's liability.  But the related doctrine of collateral estoppel prevents relitigation of issues that were in fact raised and decided in the earlier litigation, even when they arise in a new cause of action, such as a dispute as to liability for a later year. The European Union value added tax (or EU VAT) is a value added tax on goods and services within the European Union (EU).  The EU's institutions do not collect the tax, but EU member states are each required to adopt a value added tax that complies with the EU VAT code.  Different rates of VAT apply in different EU member states, ranging from 17% in Luxembourg to 27% in Hungary.  The total VAT collected by member states is used as part of the calculation to determine what each state contributes to the ""EU's budget"". A permanent establishment (PE) is a fixed place of business which generally gives rise to income or value-added tax liability in a particular jurisdiction.  The term is defined in many income tax treaties and in most European Union Value Added Tax systems.  The tax systems in some civil-law countries impose income taxes and value-added taxes only where an enterprise maintains a PE in the country concerned.  Definitions of PEs under tax law or tax treaties may contain specific inclusions or exclusions. The Kepner Income Tax is an approach to taxation, suggested in the United States, that would collect on a progressive income tax (with no deductions, credits or exemptions) and an estate tax.  It would repeal the corporate tax and payroll taxes (including Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA)).  All income, from whatever source, would be taxed the same (i.e., whether income from wages, dividends, interest or capital gains).  The plan was proposed by Hayden Kepner of the law firm Arnall Golden Gregory.  Kepner states that such a tax system would be transparent, easily understandable, could fit on a post-card, and everyone who earns an income would pay taxes.  The plan would expand the tax base and he suggests that it would have an incentive to keep federal spending at modest levels (under our current system, approximately 50% pay no income taxes and may not have the incentive to try to keep federal spending in control)."

The Guanabara Bay oil spill, one of three major spills in the bay, occurred in January 2000 in Brazil when a leaking pipeline released 1,300,000 l of oil into Guanabara Bay.  It leaked from the oil refinery at Duque de Caxias (REDUC) operated by Petrobras.  Petrobas the company at the center of the oil spill immediately moved into gear and hired a cleanup crew to assess the damages and start the process to cleaning up the affected areas.  This catastrophic accident had a damaging effect on marine life in the ocean, fishes, as well as, other existing areas surrounding the bay area.  Many fishes were washing up on the shore dead or covered in oil.  The fishing industry took a nose dive and the fishermen's livelihood was gravely affected.  As a matter of fact, the fishing industry was brought to a halt giving rise to economic downfall.  There was astronomical cost to be incurred with the clean-up process and the stakeholders were in a state of growing panic.Large areas of mangrove forests were killed and had not grown back ten years later.  The tucuxi (""Sotalia fluviatilis"") dolphin species inhabit the bay but were able to avoid the primary effects of the oil spill.

It was the first planet ever discovered outside the Solar System, and is one of three pulsar planets known to be orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12. PSR J1311–3430 is a pulsar with a spin period of 2.5 milliseconds.  It is the first millisecond pulsar found via gamma-ray pulsations.  The source was originally identified by the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope as a bright gamma ray source, but was not recognized as a pulsar until observations with the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope discovered pulsed gamma ray emission.  The pulsar has a helium-dominated companion much less massive than itself, and the two are in an orbit with a period of 93.8 minutes.  The system is explained by a model where mass from the low mass companion was transferred on to the pulsar, increasing the mass of the pulsar and decreasing its period.  These systems are known as Black Widow Pulsars, named after the original such system discovered, PSR B1957+20, and may eventually lead to the companion being completely vaporized.  Among systems like these, the orbital period of PSR J1311–3430 is the shortest ever found.  Spectroscopic observations of the companion suggest that the mass of the pulsar is 2.7 formula_1 (solar masses).  Though there is considerable uncertainty in this estimate, the minimum mass for the pulsar that the authors find adequately fits the data is 2.15 formula_1, which is still more massive than PSR J1614–2230, the previous record holder for most massive known pulsar. PSR J1614–2230 is a neutron star in a binary system with a white dwarf.  It was discovered in 2006 with the Parkes telescope in a survey of unidentified gamma ray sources in the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope catalog.  PSR J1614–2230 is a millisecond pulsar, a type of neutron star, that spins on its axis roughly 317 times per second, corresponding to a period of 3.15 milliseconds.  Like all pulsars, it emits radiation in a beam, similar to a lighthouse.  Emission from PSR J1614–2230 is observed as pulses at the spin period of PSR J1614–2230.  The pulsed nature of its emission allows for the arrival of individual pulses to be timed.  By measuring the arrival time of pulses, astronomers observed the delay of pulse arrivals from PSR J1614–2230 when it was passing behind its companion from the vantage point of Earth.  By measuring this delay, known as the Shapiro delay, astronomers determined the mass of PSR J1614–2230 and its companion.  The team performing the observations found that the mass of PSR J1614–2230 is M ."

The JIOA was established in 1945, as a subcommittee of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States Armed Forces.  The JIOA comprised one representative from each member agency of the JIC, and an operational staff of military intelligence officers from each military service. Anti-ship missiles are guided missiles that are designed for use against ships and large boats.  Most anti-ship missiles are of the sea skimming variety, and many use a combination of inertial guidance and active radar homing.  A good number of other anti-ship missiles use infrared homing to follow the heat that is emitted by a ship; it is also possible for anti-ship missiles to be guided by radio command all the way. The AN/ALQ-144, AN/ALQ-147, and AN/ALQ-157 are US infra-red guided missile countermeasure devices (IRCM).  They were developed by Sanders Associates in the 1970s to counter the threat of infra-red guided surface to air missiles like the 9K32 Strela-2.  While decoy flares were effective at jamming first generation infra-red guided missiles, each flare was only effective for a short period.  If an aircraft needed to loiter over a high risk area or was flying slowly (as helicopters do), it would require a large number of flares to decoy any missile fired at it.  The IRCM provided constant protection against infra-red guided missiles. Herbert Axster (November 3, 1899 - May 25, 1991) was a German scientist connected with Operation Paperclip.  Axster's field of expertise was guided missiles.

President Mantovani had surprised the football world by signing Liverpool stalwart Graeme Souness to the squad, and it paid off, with Souness adapting quickly to Italian football, also helping the team to win the 1985 edition of Coppa Italia, which was the first ever title for the club.  The defensive line, with Moreno Mannini, Pietro Vierchowod and Antonio Paganin among the crew, was the main reason for the success, Sampdoria conceding just 23 goals in 30 league matches played.  Quite a few of the players were still with the club when it finally won the league title in 1991. Antonio Cassano (] ; born 12 July 1982) is an Italian former professional footballer who played as a forward.  A talented and technically gifted player, he was usually deployed in a creative role, as a supporting forward throughout his career, although he was also capable of playing in more of a playmaking role, as an attacking midfielder, as well as on the wing, or as a striker.  Nicknamed ""Il Gioiello di Bari Vecchia"" (""the jewel of Old Bari""), and ""Fantantonio"" (""fantastic Antonio""), he was known for his short temper as much as his skill and ability on the pitch, which led to the coining of the neologism ""Cassanata"" by his former Roma and Real Madrid coach, Fabio Capello, in November 2002, due to their disputes over his actions.  The word is regularly used by Italian journalists as a euphemism for any behavior incompatible with team spirit in football. U.C. Sampdoria won their first ever Serie A title, thanks to a remarkable season for a team playing on its absolute peak.  Gianluca Vialli was the league top scorer on 19 goals, and Roberto Mancini, Attilio Lombardo, goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca plus centre half Pietro Vierchowod were also instrumental in Sampdoria's success story. U.C. Sampdoria returned to Serie A after a four year-absence, and immediately re-established itself as a team on the top half of the domestic championship.

The USA PATRIOT Act, though approved by large majorities in the U.S. Senate and House of Representative, was controversial, and parts of the law were invalidated or modified by successful legal challenges over constitutional infringements to civil liberties.  The Act had several sunset provisions, most reauthorized by the ""USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005"" and the ""USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act.""  Both reauthorizations incorporated amendments to the original USA PATRIOT Act, and other federal laws. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) was a U.S. Act of Congress that reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act; it included Title I provisions applying to disadvantaged students.  It supported standards-based education reform based on the premise that setting high standards and establishing measurable goals could improve individual outcomes in education.  The Act required states to develop assessments in basic skills.  To receive federal school funding, states had to give these assessments to all students at select grade levels. The National Education Goals Panel (NEGP) was an organization formed in 1990 after a meeting of President George H.W. Bush and states' governors in Charlottesville in 1989.  The organization was established to report on the nation's progress toward the six education goals adopted at the Charlottesville meeting.  The 1994 Goals 2000 legislation formally established the National Education Goals Panel in federal law, and the legislation assigned it annual reporting responsibilities.  The panel issued many reports between 1991 and 1999, and it was discontinued by the No Child Left Behind Act which became law in January, 2002. President George W.

The Act amended the Public Health Service Act to establish grant programs concerning newborn screening education and outreach, as parents are often unaware that newborn screening takes place and the number and types of screening varies across states.  It also established grant programs to coordinate follow-up care, after newborn screening is conducted.  The legislation also reauthorized programs under part A of title XI of the Public Health Service Act.  In his introductory remarks, Senator Chris Dodd stated that the legislation “protect[s] the most vulnerable members of our society: newborn infants.”  Newborn Screening is a proven life saving and effective public health tool used to identify thousands of babies in the U.S. born with genetic, metabolic, and congenital conditions.  At the time of the legislation’s passage, only 15 States along with the District of Columbia required newborns to be screened for 29 core conditions as recommended by the Health Resources and Services Administration/American College of Medical Genetics’ 2004 Report.

Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot (28 May 1888 – 22 January 1947) was an English governess and writer, who became known for her marriage in 1915 to the American poet T. S. Eliot.  Her legacy, and the extent to which she influenced Eliot's work, has been the subject of much debate.  She has been seen variously as a ""femme fatale"" who enticed the patrician Eliot into a disastrous marriage, or as his muse, without whom some of his most important work would never have been written.  Valerie Eliot, the poet's second wife (from 1957) claimed the copyright of Haigh-Wood's writings in 1984, including her private diaries, which has complicated the research into her role in Eliot's life.

""The Hollow Men"" (1925) is a poem by T. S. Eliot.  Its themes are, like many of Eliot's poems, overlapping and fragmentary, but it is recognized to be concerned most with post-World War I Europe under the Treaty of Versailles (which Eliot despised: compare ""Gerontion""), the difficulty of hope and religious conversion, and, as some critics argue, Eliot's own failed marriage (Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot might have been having an affair with Bertrand Russell)."

The forces of Hanno the Great broke the siege of Utica.  However, they failed to prepare any meaningful defense of the city once they liberated it or to maintain proper lookouts for enemy movement.  As a result, the Carthaginian forces suffered heavy losses when the mercenary forces counter-attacked, captured the Carthaginian baggage and equipment and besieged the army of Hanno within Utica.  Hanno managed to regain his freedom of maneuver later but failed to capitalize on opportunities to engage the rebel forces under favourable conditions.  This prompted Carthage to mobilize another army under Hamilcar Barca. Hannibal Barca (Punic language: 𐤇𐤍𐤁𐤏𐤋 𐤁𐤓𐤒 , ""ḥnb‘l brq""; 247 – between 183 and 181 BC), was a <a href=""Ancient%20Carthage"">Carthaginian</a> general, considered one of the greatest military commanders in history.  His father Hamilcar Barca was the leading Carthaginian commander during the First Punic War.  His younger brothers were Mago and Hasdrubal, and he was brother-in-law to Hasdrubal the Fair. The raid of the Po Valley in 203 BC was the culmination of a major war, carried out by the Carthaginian commander Mago, son of Hamilcar Barca, at the end of the Second Punic war between Rome and Carthage in what is now northwestern Italy.  Mago had landed at Genoa, Liguria, two years before, in an effort to keep the Romans busy to the North and thus hamper indirectly their plans to invade Carthage’s hinterland in Africa (modern Tunisia).  He was quite successful in reigniting the unrest among various peoples (Ligurians, Gauls, Etruscans) against the Roman dominance.  Rome was forced to concentrate large forces against him which finally resulted in a battle fought in the land of the Insubres (Lombardy).  Mago suffered defeat and had to retreat.  The strategy to divert the enemy’s forces failed as the Roman general Publius Cornelius Scipio laid waste to Africa and wiped out the Carthaginian armies that were sent to destroy the invader.  To counter Scipio the Carthaginian government recalled Mago from Italy (along with his brother Hannibal, who had been in Bruttium until then).  However, the remnants of the Carthaginian forces in Cisalpine Gaul continued to harass the Romans for several years after the end of the war. The battle or, more precisely, the battles of Croton in 204 and 203 BC were, as well as the raid in Cisalpine Gaul, the last larger scale engagements between the Romans and the Carthaginians in Italy during the Second Punic War.  After Hannibal’s retreat to Bruttium due to the Metaurus debacle, the Romans tried continuously to block his forces from gaining access to the Ionian Sea and cut his eventual escape to Carthage by capturing Croton.  The Carthaginian commander struggled to retain his hold on the last efficient port which had remained in his hands after years of fighting and was ultimately successful."

In the NFL Draft, each NFL franchise annually adds new players to its roster.  Teams are ranked in reverse order based on their records during the previous season, therefore the team with the worst record selects first.  There are two exceptions to this order: the Super Bowl champion from the previous season selects last, and the Super Bowl runner-up selects second to last.  Teams have the option of trading away their selections to other teams for different selections, players, cash, or any combination thereof.  It is common, therefore, for the actual draft selection of a team to differ from their initial assigned draft selection or for a team to have either extra selections or no selections in any round because of such trades.
