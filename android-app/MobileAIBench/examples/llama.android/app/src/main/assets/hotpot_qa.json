Downeast Airlines Flight 46 was a scheduled airline service in the United States from Boston's Logan International Airport to Rockland, Maine operated by Downeast Airlines.  On May 30, 1979 a de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter operating the flight crashed during a nonprecision approach to Rockland's Knox County Regional Airport.  The cause of the accident was controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) after the failure of the flightcrew to stop the aircraft's descent below the minimum descent altitude for the nonprecision approach at Knox County airport.  The investigation into the accident looked into the airline's corporate culture as a contributing factor to the crash; this was the first time an investigation took this approach to an air crash.

        "answer": "north to south",
        "context": "The Cruces River (Spanish: \"R\u00edo Cruces\" ) is a river near Valdivia, Chile.  R\u00edo Cruces originates from hills near the Villarica volcano and flows then in south-west direction.  The southern and final part of the river follows the Valdivian Coastal Range.  At the latitude of Valdivia it is crossed by R\u00edo Cruces Bridge near its outflow into Valdivia River.  The small village of Punucapa is the main centre for tourism in R\u00edo Cruces.  The river flow through (or near) the cities of Loncoche, Lanco, and Mariquina.  Some of the wetlands in the river's lower flow are inside Carlos Anwandter Nature Sanctuary, a protected area that in the river that extends roughly from Punucapa in the south to San Luis de Alba Fort in the north. A mouth bar is a bar in a river that is typically created in the middle of a channel in a river delta.  It is created by a positive feedback between mid-channel deposition and flow divergence.  As the flow diverges near the ocean, sediment settles out in the channel and creates an incipient mouth bar.  As flow is routed around the incipient bar, additional sediment is deposited on the incipient bar.  This continued process results in the formation of a full-fledged mouth bar, which causes the channel to bifurcate.  This continued process leads to the characteristic fractal tree pattern found in some prograding river-dominated deltas. An antidune is a bedform found in fluvial and other channeled environments.  Antidunes occur in supercritical flow, meaning that the Froude number is greater than 1.0 or the flow velocity exceeds the wave velocity; this is also known as upper flow regime.  In antidunes, sediment is deposited on the upstream (stoss) side and eroded from the downstream (lee) side, opposite lower flow regime bedforms.  As a result, antidunes migrate in an upstream direction, counter to the current flow.  Antidunes are called in-phase bedforms, meaning that the water surface elevation mimics the bed elevation; this is due to the supercritical flow regime.  Antidune bedforms evolve rapidly, growing in amplitude as they migrate upstream.  The resultant wave at the water's surface also increases in amplitude."

Mistral is named for the Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral, who lived from 1889 to 1957. The phrase land of poets (Spanish: \"pa\u00eds de poetas\" ) is commonly used to describe Chile due to its highly valued poetry tradition.  The phrase is most often associated with the fact that Chilean poets have twice obtained Nobel Prize in Literature for their works, first Gabriela Mistral in 1945 and then Pablo Neruda in 1971.  According to Austral University of Chile academician Oscar Galindo the concept of Chile as \"land of poets\" is mostly foreign. The Premio Gabriela Mistral (Premio Interamericano de Cultura \"Gabriela Mistral\" or Gabriela Mistral Inter-American Prize for Culture) was an award made by the Organization of American States.  It was created in 1979 in memory of the Nobel laureate Gabriela Mistral. Mistral is a brand of Chilean pisco owned by Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Cervecer\u00edas Unidas (CCU).  The brand takes its name from the Chilean nobel literature laureate Gabriela Mistral who was a native from Elqui Valley where pisco grapes are grown. Poet-diplomats are poets who have also served their countries as diplomats.

He was second son of Sir Thomas Harrington, who had died with the king's father at the Battle of Wakefield in December 1460.  James himself had fought with Salisbury at the Battle of Blore Heath in 1459, where he had been captured and imprisoned by the Lancastrians until the next year.  He was a significant regional figure during the reign of King Edward IV, although the early years of the new king's reign were mared by a bitter feud between him and the Stanley family over a castle in Lancashire.  On the accession of King Richard III in 1485, he was appointed to the new king's Household, and as such was almost certainly with him at Battle of Bosworth two years later.  It is likely that he fell in battle there, although precise details of his death are now unknown. John Harrington (died 30 December 1460) of Hornby, Lancashire was a member of the English northern gentry.  He was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Harrington, a retainer of the Yorkist earl of Salisbury.  His father played an active role in the northern politics of the Wars of the Roses.  On 30 December 1460 both Thomas and his father were in the army of Richard, Duke of York at the battle of Wakefield.  The Yorkist army went down to a crushing defeat, and John Harrington was killed in battle alongside his father. Dorothy Kitson (1531 \u2013 1577) later, Dorothy, Lady Pakington, was the daughter of Sir Thomas Kitson, a wealthy London merchant and the builder of Hengrave Hall in Suffolk.  Her first husband was Sir Thomas Pakington, by whom she was the mother of Queen Elizabeth I's favourite, Sir John \"Lusty\" Pakington.  After Sir Thomas Pakington's death she married Thomas Tasburgh.  She was one of the few women in Tudor England to nominate burgesses to Parliament and to make her last will while her husband, Thomas Tasburgh, was still living.  Her three nieces are referred to in the poems of Edmund Spenser. Sir Thomas Neville, (c. 1429\u20131460) was the second son of Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, a major magnate in the north of England during the fifteenth-century Wars of the Roses, and a younger brother to the more famous Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, known as the 'Kingmaker.'  Thomas worked closely with them both in administering the region for the Crown, and became a significant player in the turbulent regional politics of Northern England in the early 1450s.  His wedding in August 1453 marked the beginning of his family's armed feud with their rivals, the House of Percy, in which Thomas and his brother John led a series of raids, ambushes and skirmishe across Yorkshire against the Percys."

He worked as \"muwaqqit\" (\u0645\u0648\u0642\u062a, religious timekeeper) in the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus and constructed a sundial for its minaret in 1371/72. The Second Arab siege of Constantinople in 717\u2013718 was a combined land and sea offensive by the Muslim Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate against the capital city of the Byzantine Empire, Constantinople.  The campaign marked the culmination of twenty years of attacks and progressive Arab occupation of the Byzantine borderlands, while Byzantine strength was sapped by prolonged internal turmoil.  In 716, after years of preparations, the Arabs, led by Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik, invaded Byzantine Asia Minor.  The Arabs initially hoped to exploit Byzantine civil strife and made common cause with the general Leo III the Isaurian, who had risen up against Emperor Theodosius III.  Leo, however, tricked them and secured the Byzantine throne for himself. In urban sociology, fragmentation refers to the absence or the underdevelopment of connections between the society and the groupings of some members of that society on the lines of a common culture, nationality, race, language, occupation, religion, income level, or other common interests.  This gap between the concerned group and the rest might be social, indicating poor interrelationships among each other; economical based on structural inequalities; institutional in terms of formal and specific political, occupational, educative or associative organizations and/or geographic implying regional or residential concentration.  bell hooks coined the term when addressing the problem of 'hierarchy of oppression' within the feminist movement; where some felt experiencing more types of oppression gave greater validity to one's opinion and, therefore undermined group strength and solidarity within the movement as much as non-interscectional identity did in the 1970s [where female identity was seen predominantly through the lens of white, middle-class women and didn't take into consideration that identity could be made up of many more cultural influences such as race, gender, sexuality, spirituality etc. all intersecting across points of privilege and oppression].  hooks argued for greater inclusivity, mutual support and an understanding of various types of feminism within the movement; each sharing the same equity goals, yet having different ideas on the methods to achieve such goals.

Zanj troops dispatched by their leader 'Ali ibn Muhammad advanced against the city of al-Ubulla on the Tigris and launched an attack against it.  Despite a defense set up by the Abbasid government to protect the city, it was successfully stormed and taken by the rebels.

        "answer": "Richard Dawkins",
        "context": "Juan Terry Trippe (June 27, 1899 \u2013 April 3, 1981) was an American commercial aviation pioneer, entrepreneur and the founder of Pan American World Airways, one of the iconic airlines of the 20th century.  He was instrumental in numerous revolutionary advances in airline history, including the development and production of the Boeing 314 Clipper, which opened trans-Pacific airline travel, the Boeing Stratocruiser which helped to pioneer cabin pressurization, the Boeing 707 which launched the Jet Age, and the Boeing 747 which introduced the era of jumbo jets (evolved from Air Force bombers, tanker and transport design, respectively).  Trippe's signing of the 747 contract coincided with the 50th anniversary of Boeing, and he gave a speech where he explained his belief that these jets would be a force that would help bring about world peace. The teleological or physico-theological argument, also known as the argument from design, or intelligent design argument is an argument for the existence of God or, more generally, for an intelligent creator \"based on perceived evidence of deliberate design in the natural or physical world\".  It is an argument in natural theology. The Boeing 747SP is a version of the Boeing 747 jet airliner which was designed for ultra-long-range flights.  The \"SP\" stands for \"Special Performance\".  The 747SP is similar to the 747-100 except for the shortened fuselage, larger tailplane, and simplified trailing edge flaps.  The weight saved by the shorter fuselage permits longer range and increased speed relative to other 747 configurations at the time. The Boeing 747 Dreamlifter, also known as the Boeing 747-400 Large Cargo Freighter (LCF), is a wide-body cargo aircraft.  At 65,000 cubic feet (1,840 cubic meters) the cargo hold is the largest in the world for an aircraft.  It can hold three times the volume of a 747-400F freighter.  Cargo is placed in the aircraft by the world's longest cargo loader.  It is an extensively modified Boeing 747-400 that is used exclusively for transporting Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft components to Boeing's assembly plants from suppliers around the world. The Boeing 747-400 is an improvement of the 747-300, and is the best-selling model of the Boeing 747 family of jet airliners.  While retaining the four-engine wide-body layout of its predecessors, the 747-400 embodies numerous technological and structural changes to produce a more efficient airframe.  Its most distinguishing features versus preceding 747 models are 6 ft winglets mounted on 6 ft wing tip extensions, which are found on all 747-400s except for Japanese domestic market versions. The Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit is a counter-argument to modern versions of the argument from design for the existence of God.  It was introduced by Richard Dawkins in chapter 4 of his 2006 book \"The God Delusion\", \"Why there almost certainly is no God\". The Boeing 747-8 is a wide-body jet airliner developed by Boeing Commercial Airplanes."

It also sought to \"reform the chiropractic profession away from a philosophical scope of practice and towards an applied science scope of practice.\"  It stated that it was \"dedicated to bringing the scientific based practice of chiropractic into mainstream medicine\" and that its members \"confine their scope of practice to scientific parameters and seek to make legitimate the utilization of professional manipulative procedures in mainstream health care delivery.\"  \"While the NACM is focused on furthering the profession, its primary focus is on the rights and safety of the consumers.\"  The NACM was the object of much controversy and criticism from the rest of the profession.

Although labelled \"Classical,\" many of the work's features point to Beethoven rather than Haydn or Mozart, such as \"the way in which Shapero paces himself, alternating long passages in the tonic and the dominant, with fast, dramatic modulations often reserved for transitions and developments.\"  Nicolas Slonimsky remarked on how the piece is \"premeditatedly cast in the proclamatory key of B-flat major, the natural tonality of the bugle, and ending in a display of tonic major triads.\"  But there are modern features as well, with \"the work's orchestration, in general, ... distinctively bright and brassy, and undoubtedly derived a fair amount from Piston and Copland, as well as from the composer's experience as a dance band arranger.\" Sequoia is an orchestral composition by the American composer Joan Tower.  The work was commissioned by the American Composers Orchestra with support from the Jerome Foundation.  It was first performed on May 18, 1981 in Alice Tully Hall by the American Composers Orchestra under the conductor Dennis Russell Davies.

Aaron Copland ( ; November 14, 1900December 2, 1990) was an American composer, composition teacher, writer, and later a conductor of his own and other American music.  Copland was referred to by his peers and critics as \"the Dean of American Composers.\"  The open, slowly changing harmonies in much of his music are typical of what many people consider to be the sound of American music, evoking the vast American landscape and pioneer spirit.  He is best known for the works he wrote in the 1930s and 1940s in a deliberately accessible style often referred to as \"populist\" and which the composer labeled his \"vernacular\" style.  Works in this vein include the ballets \"Appalachian Spring\", \"Billy the Kid\" and \"Rodeo\", his \"Fanfare for the Common Man\" and Third Symphony.  In addition to his ballets and orchestral works, he produced music in many other genres including chamber music, vocal works, opera and film scores."

In just fourteen years, the Court heard 106 criminal cases, almost as many cases as the Supreme Court had heard in the period from its creation to the appointment of Waite as Chief Justice.  Notable cases include \"United States v. Cruikshank\" (1875), \"United States v. Reese\" (1875), \"Reynolds v. United States\" (1878), \"Wilkerson v. Utah\" (1879), the \"Trade-Mark Cases\" (1879), \"Strauder v. West Virginia\" (1880), \"Pace v. Alabama\" (1883), \"United States v. Harris\" (1883), \"Ex parte Crow Dog\" (1883), \"Hurtado v. California\" (1884), \"Clawson v. United States\" (1885), \"Yick Wo v. Hopkins\" (1886), \"United States v. Kagama\" (1886), \"Ker v. Illinois\" (1886), and \"Mugler v. Kansas\" (1887). The AQM-127 Supersonic Low-Altitude Target (SLAT) was a target drone developed during the 1980s by Martin Marietta for use by the United States Navy.  Derived from Martin Marietta's work on the cancelled ASALM missile, SLAT proved to have severe difficulties in flight testing, and the project was cancelled during 1991. United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 (1990) was a United States Supreme Court case that invalidated a federal law against flag desecration as violating of free speech under the First Amendment.  It was argued together with the case \"United States v. Haggerty\".  It built on the opinion handed down in the Court's decision the prior year in \"Texas v. Johnson\" (1989), which invalidated on First Amendment grounds a Texas state statute banning flag-burning. United States v. Binion, 132 F. App'x 89 (8th Cir.  2005), is a case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit applied two recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions (\"United States v. Booker\", 543 U.S. 220 (2005) and \"United States v. Fanfan\", 543 U.S. 220 (2005) in reviewing the sentencing decision by the trial court and upheld by the Federal District Court for the Eastern District. Phillips v. Payne, 92 U.S. 105 (1875), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the court ruled that since 1847, pursuant to the act of Congress of the preceding year, the State of Virginia has been in de facto possession of the County of Alexandria, which, prior thereto, formed a part of the District of Columbia.  The political department of her government has, since that date, uniformly asserted, and the head of her judicial department expressly affirmed, her title thereto.  Congress has, by more than one act, recognized the transfer as a settled fact.  A resident of that county, in a suit to recover the amount by him paid under protest for taxes upon his property there situate is therefore estopped from raising the question as to the validity of the retrocession. Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., 400 U.S. 542 (1971) , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, an employer may not, in the absence of business necessity, refuse to hire women with pre-school-age children while hiring men with such children.  It was the first sex discrimination case under Title VII to reach the Court. United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174 (1939) , was a Supreme Court case that involved a Second Amendment challenge to the National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA).  \"Miller\" is often cited in the ongoing American gun politics debate, as both sides claim that it supports their position. United States v. Graham, 846 F. Supp.  2d 384 (D.

One of the driving forces behind the production, star Richard Bach, is a pilot in real life, and recruited a group of his friends who were also pilots to recreate the era of the barnstormer. Lichtzwang (rendered in English as Lightduress) is a 1970 German-language poetry collection by Paul Celan.  It was written in 1967, and published three months after Celan's death.  It was published in an English translation in 2005. Six Celan Songs \u2022 The Ballad of Kastriot Rexhepi is the 54th album release by Michael Nyman, who not only composed but also conducted both the works on the album.  The first, a setting of poetry by Paul Celan, was originally recorded by Ute Lemper and the Michael Nyman Band on \"The Michael Nyman Songbook\" in 1991, and here the band is joined by Hilary Summers.  \"The Ballad of Kastriot Rexhepi\" is a new work created with the artist Mary Kelly.  This is performed by soprano Sarah Leonard with The Nyman Quartet: Gabrielle Lester, Catherine Thompson, Kate Musker, and Tony Hinnigan. Paul Celan ( ; ] ; 23 November 1920 \u2013 c. 20 April 1970) was a Romanian-born German language poet and translator.

He became one of the major German-language poets of the post-World War II era. Richard David Bach (born June 23, 1936) is an American writer.  Bach is widely known as the author of some hugely popular 1970s best-sellers, including \"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\" (1970) and \"Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah\" (1977).  Bach has authored numerous works of fiction and non-fiction, including \"\" (1989) and \"Out of My Mind\" (1999). The Cambridge Poetry Festival, founded by Richard Berengarten (also known as Richard Burns), was an international biennale for poetry held in Cambridge, England, between 1975\u20131985.  The festival was founded in an attempt to combine as many aspects as possible of this form of art.  Thus Michael Hamburger could, for example, recite his English interpretations of Paul Celan's poetry in the presence of Gis\u00e8le Lestrange and a surprisingly large audience at an art gallery bestowed on her engravings.  The last biennale in 1985 included a number of events to mark Ezra Pound's centenary, including the exhibition \"Pound's Artists: Ezra Pound and the Visual Arts in London, Paris and Italy\" at Kettle's Yard (later also shown at the Tate Gallery), and was accompanied by a special issue of the magazine P.N.

They first participated in the 1966 NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting, more commonly known as the NFL Draft.  In the NFL Draft, each NFL franchise annually seeks to add new players to its roster.  Teams are ranked in reverse order based on the previous season's record, with the worst record picking first, the second-worst picking second and so on.  The two exceptions to this order are made for teams that appeared in the previous Super Bowl; the Super Bowl champion always picks 32nd, and the Super Bowl loser always picks 31st.  Teams have the option of trading away their picks to other teams for different picks, players, cash, or a combination thereof.  Thus, it is not uncommon for a team's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick, or for a team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these trades. The 2009 NFL Draft was the seventy-fourth annual meeting of National Football League (NFL) franchises to select newly eligible football players.  The draft took place at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, New York, on April 25 and 26, 2009.  The draft consisted of two rounds on the first day starting at 4:00 pm EDT, and five rounds on the second day starting at 10:00 am EDT.  To compensate for the time change from the previous year and in an effort to help shorten the draft, teams were no longer on the clock for 15 minutes in the first round and 10 minutes in the second round.  Each team now had 10 minutes to make their selection in the first round and seven minutes in the second round.  Rounds three through seven were shortened to five minutes per team."

It was also used by the director-general of the \u00d8resund Custom House, Colonel Adam Gottlob von Krogh and his wife Magdalene, between 1796 and 1847. Frederick, Hereditary Prince of Denmark (Danish: \"Frederik\" ; 11 October 1753 \u2013 7 December 1805) was heir presumptive to the thrones of Denmark and Norway.  He was the surviving son of King Frederick V by his second wife, Juliana Maria of Braunschweig-Wolfenb\u00fcttel.

On December 17, 2004, disgruntled All-Star Vince Carter was traded to the New Jersey Nets for Eric Williams, Aaron Williams, and Alonzo Mourning.  Mourning would never report to Toronto and he was waived not long after the trade.  He later signed with the Miami Heat for his second stint.  Guard Alvin Williams missed the entire season due to right knee inflammation.

It is native to a wide region of Western Asia that includes Israel, Iraq, Iran and Turkey.  It was first described by the taxonomist Carl Linnaeus in 1753.  It is unknown why he gave it the specific epithet \"indica\", since the plant is not from India.  While \"Salvia indica\" is classified as a herbaceous perennial, in cultivation individual plants often live no longer than two years. Trichophorum cespitosum, commonly known as deergrass or tufted bulrush, is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family.  It was originally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 as \"Scirpus cespitosus\", but was changed to \"Trichophorum cespitosum\" by Carl Johan Hartman in 1849. Isolepis fluitans (syn.  \"Scirpus fluitans\") is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family.  It is native to Africa, Australasia, Europe, and Pacific.  It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, and later transferred to \"Isolepis\" by the botanist Robert Brown in 1810. Argentina anserina is a synonym of \"Potentilla anserina\" L., the accepted name of a perennial flowering plant in the rose family Rosaceae.  It is known by the common names \"silverweed\", common silverweed or silverweed cinquefoil.  It is native throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere, often on river shores and in grassy habitats such as meadows and road-sides.  The plant was originally placed in the genus \"Potentilla\" by Carl Linnaeus in his Species plantarum, edition 1, (1753) but was reclassified into the resurrected genus \"Argentina\" by research conducted in the 1990s.  It is a species aggregate which has frequently been divided into multiple species.  The reclassification remains controversial and is not accepted by some authorities. Cannabis sativa is an annual herbaceous plant in the \"Cannabis\" genus.  It is a member of a small, but diverse family of flowering plants of the Cannabaceae family.  It has been cultivated throughout recorded history, used as a source of industrial fibre, seed oil, food, recreation, religious and spiritual moods and medicine."

The current lineup consists of Gillespie, Andrew Innes (guitar), Martin Duffy (keyboards), Simone Butler (bass) and Darrin Mooney (drums).  Barrie Cadogan has toured and recorded with the band since 2006 as a replacement after the departure of guitarist Robert \"Throb\" Young. \"Rocks\" is a song by British group Primal Scream, taken from their fourth album, \"Give Out But Don't Give Up\".  The song was released as a single in 1994 and reached number 7 on the UK Singles Chart, acting as a double A-side with another of the band's songs, \"Funky Jam\".  Together they were the highest-ranked Primal Scream single until \"Country Girl\" in 2006. \"Velocity Girl\" is a song by British alternative rock band Primal Scream, originally released as the B-side to their second single, \"Crystal Crescent\", in 1986.  Shortly preceding its release, Primal Scream\u2019s frontman, Bobby Gillespie, left his post as the drummer of The Jesus and Mary Chain, recording only one album with them, the influential noise pop release \"Psychocandy\" (1985).  Disentangled from their major label \"whirlwind\", he resumed activity with the lesser known Primal Scream, proceeding to, as \"Pitchfork Media\" later described it, \"reduce the pop song to its subatomic essence: quick, breezy, quirky, and above all, exquisitely small\" with \"Velocity Girl\".

His remix \"My Beautiful Friend\" for UK Indie band The Charlatans was so groundbreaking that it inspired Eddy Temple-Morris, a DJ at the XFM radio station to form a show dedicated to remixes.  Kooner also worked with Rammstein, Siobhan Fahey, Ladytron, Adam Freeland, dEUS, Kasabian and more recently Reverend and the Makers.  His remix of 'Swastika Eyes', for Primal Scream appears as one of two remixes of the track on the \"Xtrmntr\" album.  He has also remixed two songs from the Oasis album, \"Dig Out Your Soul\".  On the bonus CD available only as part of the Deluxe Edition, Jagz Kooner has remixed first single 'The Shock Of The Lightning', as well as, the album track 'The Turning'.  He has also been keenly involved in the UK mash-up scene. XTRMNTR (pronounced \"Exterminator\") is the sixth studio album by Primal Scream.  In a departure from Primal Scream's earlier hedonistic recordings, the band took a more political stance, attacking government, police, and multinational corporations.  The sound of the album is much more aggressive and forceful than the group's previous output, with harsh industrial sounds forming the basis for songs such as \"Insect Royalty\", \"Accelerator\" and \"Swastika Eyes\"."

As of the 2010 census, Waterbury had a population of 110,366, making it the 10th largest city in the New York Metropolitan Area, 9th largest city in New England and the 5th largest city in Connecticut. In March of 1887, Frank Lloyd Wright, having newly moved to Chicago to try to become an architect, received a letter from his aunt Ellen C. Lloyd Jones asking him to perhaps design a building for the school that she planned with her sister, Jane (\"Jenny\").  Biographer Meryle Secrest wrote about the letter from \"Aunt 'Nell'\" to Wright in her biography on the architect: The letter contains detailed instructions about floor plans... She added that some of her friends were contributing their architectural notions.  The nephew seems to have cut them all out fast.  His resulting designs were evidently derived from those of [Joseph Lyman] Silsbee [his then-employer], and one of his authorized biographies more or less acknowledges that this architect played the largest role.  Wright dismissed his first attempt as \"amateurish.\"  Nell Lloyd Jones asked her nephew to design this structure because she and Jenny were planning on beginning the Hillside Home School on land left to them by their father, in the town of Wyoming, Wisconsin (south of the town of Spring Green).  This building, which became known as the \"Home Building\", was the first one designed specifically by Wright for the school, a coeducational day and boarding school which functioned until 1915.  Silsbee had introduced the young Wright to the \"Shingle Style mixture of Queen Anne and Colonial elements.\"  In 1907, Spring Green's newspaper, the \"Weekly Home News\", ran an article focused on the Hillside Home School institution, then in its twentieth year.  In the section about the home building, the article stated that it:[C]ontains the parlors, in one of which there is a beautiful carved fireplace which at once attracts the attention of the visitor\u2026.  This building also contains the dining rooms, living rooms and kitchens, which are all modern and well-equipped.  Besides these are twenty-two rooms which are occupied by the girls and some of the teachers.  They are all large, well ventilated and sunny.  The architecture of this building is English.The Home Building was the first of three structures that Wright would design for the Hillside Home School.  In addition to the 1887 design, he was commissioned to design the Romeo and Juliet Windmill in 1896 and the Hillside Home School in 1901 (often referred to as Hillside Home School II to differentiate it from the 1887 structure). The Barber-Pittman House at 416 N. Ashley St. in Valdosta, Georgia was built in 1915.  It was a work of architect Lloyd Barton Greer."

The Masoch Fund is a Ukrainian art association founded in 1991 in Lviv by Roman Viktyuk, Ihor Podolchak and Ihor Dyurych.  Its artistic practice is connected with the tradition of European actionism and Nicolas Bourriaud\u2019s \u201crelational aesthetics\u201d.  The Fund is named after Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, which makes a reference to the marginal fields of culture and society and also underlines the locality (Sacher-Masoch was born in Lviv). Venus in Fur (French: La V\u00e9nus \u00e0 la fourrure ) is a 2013 French drama film directed by Roman Polanski.  It is based on the play of the same name by American playwright David Ives, which itself was inspired by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch's novel \"Venus in Furs\". Venus in Furs (Italian: \"Venere in pelliccia\" ) (also known as Devil in the Flesh) is a 1969 Italian erotic drama film directed by Massimo Dallamano.  Based on the novel \"Venus in Furs\" by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, the film was first released in 1969 in Germany under the title \"Venuz im pelz\".  In Italy, the film did not pass the censorship examination because of the sex scenes deemed too rough and all attempts to overcome the censorship's remarks, with various cut versions, were unsuccessful.  The film was eventually released in 1973 under the title \"Venere nuda\", but even this cut version was confiscated after a few days for contempt of decency.  In 1975, the film was finally released in Italian cinemas under the title \"Le malizie di Venere\", in a heavily censored version which was altered by a new editing and by the introduction of new scenes filmed by Paolo Heusch, which turned the film plot into a\" giallo\".  The new title was a specific reference to the Laura Antonelli's box-office success of two years before \"Malizia\".

        "question": "What is one of the oldest beverages humans have produced with recipes found in Sumerian writings?",
        "answer": "Beer",
        "context": "Beer is one of the oldest beverages humans have produced, dating back to at least the 5th millennium BC in Iran, and was recorded in the written history of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia and spread throughout the world. Gastronomy is the study of the relationship between food and culture, art of preparing and serving rich or delicate and appetizing food, a style of cooking of particular region, and the science of good eating.  One who is well versed in gastronomy is called a gastronome, while a gastronomist is one who unites theory and practice in the study of gastronomy.  Practical gastronomy is associated with the practice and study of the preparation, production, and service of the various foods and beverages, from countries around the world.  Theoretical gastronomy supports practical gastronomy.  It is related with a system and process approach, focused on recipes and cookery books.  Food gastronomy is connected with food and beverages and their genesis.  Technical gastronomy underpins practical gastronomy, introducing a rigorous approach to evaluation of gastronomic topics. Alcohol, also known by its chemical name ethanol, is a psychoactive drug found as the active ingredient in alcoholic beverages such as beer, wine, and distilled spirits.  It is one of the oldest and most common recreational drugs, causing the characteristic effects of alcohol intoxication or \"drunkenness\".  Among other effects, alcohol produces euphoria, decreased anxiety, increased sociability, sedation, impairment of cognition, memory, and motor function, and generalized depression of central nervous system function.  Ethanol is the only type of alcohol that is found in alcoholic beverages and is commonly used for recreational purposes; other alcohols such as methanol and isopropyl alcohol are toxic and potentially lethal. The Anunnaki (also transcribed as Anunaki, Anunna, Ananaki, and other variations) are a group of deities that appear in the mythological traditions of the ancient Sumerians, Akkadians, Assyrians, and Babylonians.  Descriptions of how many Anunnaki there were and what role they fulfilled are inconsistent and often contradictory.  In the earliest Sumerian writings about them, which come from the Post-Akkadian period, the Anunnaki are the most powerful deities in the pantheon, descendants of An, the god of the heavens, and their primary function is to decree the fates of humanity.  In \"Inanna's Descent into the Netherworld\", the Anunnaki are portrayed as seven judges who sit before the throne of Ereshkigal in the Underworld.  Later Akkadian texts, such as \"The Epic of Gilgamesh\", follow this portrayal.  During the Old Babylonian period, the Anunnaki were believed to be the chthonic deities of the Underworld, while the gods of the heavens were known as the Igigi. Thomistic sacramental theology is St. Thomas Aquinas's theology of the sacraments of the Catholic Church.  It can be found through his writings in the \"Summa contra Gentiles\" and in the \"Summa Theologi\u00e6\"."

Many of these hills and mountains serve as the basis for the names of such places as Donaustauf, Hohenstaufen, Staufenberg, Regenstauf, Staufen im Breisgau, and the Staufens of Switzerland and Austria.  Stauffer surnames derive from these hills.

The ACC is the dominant circulation feature of the Southern Ocean and has a mean transport of 100-150 Sverdrups (Sv, million\u00a0m\u00b3/s), making it the largest ocean current.  More recent research even puts this number at over 173 Sv.  The current is circumpolar due to the lack of any landmass connecting with Antarctica and this keeps warm ocean waters away from Antarctica, enabling that continent to maintain its huge ice sheet.

It is raised on the slopes of Vesuvius, on the slopes of the Monti Lattari, and in the Agro Nocerino Sarnese which lies between them.  The origin of the breed is unknown.  It may derive from goats of African origin imported to the area in the early years of the twentieth century; the alternative name Torca Nera, \"black Turkish goat\", suggests an origin in the Mediterranean basin.
