As Gianforte moved on top of Jacobs, he began yelling something to the effect of, 'I'm sick and tired of this!'\" Alicia Acuna said.\nMr Jacob's glasses were broken during the incident.\nMr Gianforte initially claimed Mr Jacobs had grabbed his wrist, pulling them both to the ground. His spokesperson called it \"aggressive behaviour from a liberal journalist\".\nBut in his formal apology to Mr Jacobs on Wednesday, he said: \"Notwithstanding anyone's statements to the contrary, you did not initiate any physical contact with me, and I had no right to assault you. I am sorry for what I did and the unwanted notoriety this has created for you.\n\"I take full responsibility,\" he added.\nThe apology also detailed the donation to the CPJ, \"in the hope that perhaps some good can come of these events\".\nThe CPJ is an independent non-profit group that promotes press freedom globally.\nIn a tweet, the group said it had accepted the donation for what it called Mr Gianforte's \"unacceptable behaviour toward a journalist just doing his job\".\nIn the Guardian, Mr Jacobs said he had accepted the apology.\nThe newspaper had previously covered Mr Jacob's acquisition of a new pair of glasses from a London optician - noting that he donated the pair broken in the clash to Washington DC's press museum, the Newseum.",

It also accused the government of \"exploiting\" the violence to target its members and \"create further violence, chaos and instability\".\nThe explosion shook the building at about 01:10 (23:10 GMT on Monday).\nMedia reports say the provincial security chief was among those hurt. Officials said most of the casualties were police officers.\nThe blast shattered windows of nearby buildings and its impact was felt about 20km (12 miles) away, the reports say.\nMansoura - a city of about 480,000 people - is the capital of Dakahliya province in the Nile Delta region.\nSince the removal of Mr Morsi - Egypt's first democratically elected president - his supporters have been staging mass rallies demanding his immediate release.\nMore than 2,000 Muslim Brotherhood members have been arrested, and 450 of them on Monday went on hunger strike in protest at their \"inhumane treatment\".\nMr Morsi is now facing three separate criminal trials relating to his time in office.\nThe first trial opened on 4 November, but has been adjourned until 8 January.",

Unconfirmed reports suggested a number of civilians were killed, including an eight-year-old girl whose father and brother were killed in drone strikes six years ago.\nHere's what we know and what's been reported.\nThe US operatives targeted the house of a suspected senior AQAP leader in the mountainous Yakla region of Bayda province - the focal point of recent US drone strikes in Yemen.\nA Pentagon spokesman said the clandestine mission - the first authorised by President Donald Trump - was an intelligence-gathering operation designed to retrieve computer hard drives.\nThe US commandos were dropped near the target location and engaged in a firefight with suspected AQAP militants. Chief Petty Officer William Owens, a member of the elite US Navy special forces unit Seal Team 6, was killed and one other service member was wounded.\nAQAP said in a statement that Abdul Rauf al-Dhahab, one of its leaders, was killed in the fighting. This has not been confirmed by the US.\nAt first, US officials said only that 14 AQAP fighters were killed and denied that there were civilian casualties. But reports credited to Yemeni officials and medics on the ground said that 16 civilians were killed, including women and children.\nAsked on Monday about the reports, Pentagon spokesman Capt Jeff Davis said that some of the AQAP fighters were women.\nHe said: \"Take reports of female casualties with a grain of salt. Not all female casualties are civilian casualties. In many cases, and certainly in this one, females can be legitimate combatants.\"\nOther reports said that an eight-year-old girl, Nawar al-Awlaki, was killed. Her grandfather, who was not at the scene, said in interviews with NBC and Reuters news agency that she was shot dead by US forces. Her uncle also posted to Facebook to say she had died.\nImages circulated on social media and by local media outlets purported to show her body.\nNawar is the daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, a suspected senior al-Qaeda leader killed by a US drone strike in 2011.

Its wiring changes and grows as we do. The organ is a physical embodiment of our behaviour and who we are.\nIn recent years, researchers have made links between the shape of the brain and mental and neurological disorders.\nMore than 3,000 brains are storied at the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center at McLean Hospital just outside Boston. It is one of the largest brain banks in the world.\nMost of their specimens are from people with mental or neurological disorders.\nSamples are requested by scientists to find new treatments for Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and a whole host of psychiatric disorders.\nBut there is a problem. Scientists at McLean Hospital and at brain banks across the world do not have enough specimens for the research community.\nAccording Dr Kerry Ressler, who is the chief scientific officer at McLean hospital, new treatments for many mental and neurological diseases are within the grasp of the research community. However, he says it is the lack of brain tissue that is holding back their development.\n\"We have the tools and the ability to do some great deep-level biology of the human brain now.\n\"What we are lacking are the tissues from those with the disorders we need to really understand.\"\nOne donor visiting the hospital, who wished to be known only as Caroline, told BBC News that she decided to donate her brain for medical research partly because her sister has schizophrenia.\nShe hopes that her donation will help researchers find a cure \u2013 and she's urging others to do the same.\n\u201cMy parents were fine but why did my sister get schizophrenia?

It's dangerous. There are snipers everywhere along the exit routes,\" one resident told Reuters by internet.\nThe UN says there have been no deliveries of aid since IS militants were driven from the nearby city of Ramadi in December and supply routes were cut.\nThe tens of thousands of civilians living in Falluja have faced acute shortages of food, medicine and other essential items. Prices have escalated dramatically.\nThe Iraqi military has urged all civilians to leave Falluja. It has instructed those unable to escape to raise a white flag over their location and stay away from IS positions and gatherings.\n\"No-one can leave. It's dangerous. There are snipers everywhere along the exit routes,\" one resident told the Reuters news agency by internet.\nMr Dujarric said the UN was \"very concerned\" about the fate of the civilians that remain in Fallujah.\nThe UN says women and children have died while trying to escape the city.\nFalluja has been attacked many times and bombed and shelled almost incessantly since it fell into the militants' hands in January 2014. It has withstood all that, despite huge destruction and many casualties.\nNow the government has committed itself to \"liberating\" the city once and for all, in an operation codenamed \"Break Terrorism\".\nBut there are conflicting assessments of how tough the battle will be.\nSome believe that IS has taken such a pounding in the town that its ability to resist has been sapped. Others, in touch with sources inside the beleaguered city, say the militants have long been preparing to face such an offensive and have deployed their full array of defences, including many roadside bombs and booby traps.\nHow tough will it be to recapture Falluja from IS?\n\"The humanitarian situation obviously remains very fluid as the fighting is ongoing.\"\nMr Dujarric said civilians would \"come under great danger as they try to flee\" and that it was important that there were some safe corridors that they could use.\nUNHCR spokeswoman Leila Jane Nassif said 80 families were believed to have fled Falluja since Friday.\nMs Nassif also expressed concern for the safety of men and older boys who survived the escape. She said they were being separated from the women and other children by security forces and taken for security screening at Habbaniya military base.\nIn the event that civilians are able to leave Falluja, the UN and other humanitarian organisations have set up shelters for them in nearby towns.\nIraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who has instructed the military to \"preserve the lives of citizens\" in Falluja, said on Monday that government forces had made better progress than expected.\nShia militias are reinforcing the army and police spearheading the offensive on the predominantly Sunni Arab city.

Some people experience tastes when they read or hear words, some perceive numbers as shapes, others see colours when they hear music.\nPeople with synaesthesia might say: \"The letter q is dark brown,\" or: \"The word 'hello' tastes like coffee,\" for example.\nFollowing anecdotal evidence of links between synaesthesia and Asperger's syndrome, researchers at the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge University set out to test the idea.\nMore than 200 study participants - 164 adults diagnosed with high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome, and 97 adults without autism - were asked to fill in questionnaires to measure synaesthesia and autism traits.\nThe study found one in five adults with autism spectrum conditions - a range of related developmental disorders, including autism and Asperger's syndrome - had synaesthesia compared with about 7% of people with no signs of the disorders.\nProf Simon Baron-Cohen, who led the research, told BBC News:  \"Synaesthesia involves a mixing of the senses and it's a very subjective private experience, so the only way we know it's happening is if you ask people to report on their experiences.\n\"And what this new study has done is ask people whether they experience synaesthesia, for example where a sound triggers the experience of colour or a taste triggers the experience of colour, and finding that these unusual experiences are actually much more common in autism than we previously knew.\"\nThe research, to be published in the journal Molecular Autism, suggests that while the two conditions might appear distinct, there could actually be some underlying similarities in brain connectivity.\nSynaesthesia seems to involve unusual connections between brain areas not usually wired together, accounting for the jumbling up of the senses.\nOne theory about autism is that it involves over-connectivity of neurons, so that a person focuses on small details but finds it difficult to see the big picture.\nFuture research is needed to explore biological mechanisms behind both conditions, including carrying out detailed brain scans, says the Cambridge University team.\nCarol Povey, director of the National Autistic Society's Centre for Autism, said the study could help improve our understanding of autism.\n\"People with the condition can find everyday life confusing or even frightening, so research like this, which helps us to understand more about how they experience the world, is valuable,\" she said.\n\"It can help us to develop more appropriate support and to make adjustments according to their needs, which is vital if people with autism are to reach their full potential.\n\"With the right support at the right time people with autism can live the life they choose.\"",

        "question": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nAfter a drab first half, Jose Mourinho brought on Willian and Diego Costa who provided some much-needed spark.\nWillian struck from 25 yards to give the hosts the lead while Loic Remy doubled Chelsea's advantage with a well-taken half-volley from 12 yards.\nKurt Zouma completed the scoring, heading in Cesar Azpilicueta's cross.\nWith the influential quartet of Cesc Fabregas, Nemanja Matic, Costa and Eden Hazard not starting - Jose Mourinho made eight changes to the team which lost to Tottenham - it was perhaps no surprise the hosts did not immediately click.\nBut Mourinho's men have suffered a dip in form of late, letting an eight-point advantage in the Premier League slip.\nChelsea lacked creativity and control in midfield, with Watford, fifth in the second tier, initially reducing the Premier League co-leaders to half-chances - a flick-on from a free-kick for Gary Cahill and then a glancing header from the defender.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIt was no surprise to see Mourinho make changes at the break, but the Hornets' energetic pressing and physicality continued to stifle the Blues in the early stages of the second half.\nWatford nearly took the lead when Troy Deeney's hopeful shot deflected off Filipe Luis, narrowly missing the bottom left corner.\nBut within minutes, Chelsea were ahead thanks to Willian's fabulous arrowed strike into the top-right corner.\nWatford initially refused to cave in, but crumbled once they fell further behind courtesy of Remy's impressive half-volley, with the Frenchman pouncing while his team-mates appealed for a penalty for handball.\nKurt Zouma polished the script for the hosts, powerfully heading into the top corner to inflict a fifth loss in six FA Cup ties for Watford against Chelsea.",

        "question": "A Harvard University team came up with a way to drive down the cost of flow battery technology, which is capable of storing energy on large scales - within an electrical power grid, for example.\nGrid-scale storage for renewables could be a game-changer - making wind and solar more economical and reliable.\nDetails appear in the journal Nature.\nWhile flow battery designs are suited to storing large amounts of energy cheaply, they have previously relied on chemicals that are expensive or difficult to maintain, driving up costs.\nMost previous flow batteries have chemistries based on metals. Vanadium is used in the most commercially advanced flow battery technology, but its cost is relatively high. Other variants contain precious metal catalysts such as platinum.\nThe researchers say their new battery already performs as well as vanadium flow batteries, but uses no precious metal catalyst and has an underlying chemistry that is metal-free, instead relying on naturally abundant, more affordable chemicals called quinones.\nThese water-soluble compounds are organic (carbon-based) and are similar to chemicals that store energy in plants and animals.\n\"These molecules are cheap and they're in all green vegetables, as well as crude oil,\" said co-author Michael Aziz from the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nThe mismatch between the availability of intermittent wind or sunshine and the changing demand for grid electricity is one of the main obstacles to boosting the fraction of energy that comes from renewable sources.\nProf Aziz told the Nature podcast: \"What do you do when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing? This problem is the one we think we can solve with a way to store massive amounts of electrical energy, if we can make it cost effective and safe. And we think we've taken a big step in that direction now.\"\nMuch like fuel cells, flow batteries store energy in chemical fluids contained by external tanks, instead of within the battery container itself as do the solid-electrode batteries found in cars and mobile devices.\n\"[A flow battery is] similar to a fuel cell in that respect. It stores energy as hydrogen gas outside the fuel cell and when you need to convert that chemical energy into electrical energy, you run it through the fuel cell to make electricity,\" Prof Aziz explained.\n\"The difference with a flow battery is that you need to run it forwards and backwards. You run it backwards to turn the electrical energy into chemical energy and store it in the tanks. Then you run it forwards to get the energy back out, converting the chemical energy back into electricity.\"\nThe amount of energy that can be stored by a flow battery is limited only by the size of the tanks and the amounts of storage chemicals that can be afforded, he added.\nIn an accompanying article in Nature, Grigorii Soloveichik, from General Electric Global Research in New York, called the results \"promising\", and said the approach \"may serve as the basis for a new flow-battery technology\".\nThe scientist, who was not involved with the latest study, added: \"If long-term capacity and energy efficiency retention can be demonstrated, and if practically useful batteries can indeed be prepared cheaply, then this technology will be suitable for a wide array of energy-storage applications.\"\nPaul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter",

        "question": "He could more accurately have described us as a nation of shoppers.\nConsumer spending is the driver of the UK's economic growth, accounting for about 60% of all our economic activity.\nThe quickest route to a downturn in that growth figure is consumers who rein in spending.\nToday's sharp rise in prices (inflation is now at its highest rate for four years) increases the pressure on the just-about-managing classes.\nAnd savers, once again, are feeling the strain in an era of ultra-low interest rates.\nThe fall in the value of sterling since the Brexit referendum is the main inflation driver (but not the only one) as it increases the prices of the 40% of food and fuel we import.\nAnd all the basics businesses buy abroad to make the things we purchase or provide us with services.\nOf course, it is not all one way traffic.\nSterling's decline is good for exporters and for those global corporations based in the UK which earn a substantial proportion of their revenues in dollars and pay increased dividends to shareholders that include our pension funds.\nSome inflation can also be good for an economy as businesses tend to invest more if they assume that prices - and revenues - will rise in the future.\nBut the clear and present danger from this inflation spike is for consumers.\nWhich is, pretty much, all of us.\nInflation is now at 2.9%, already above where the Bank of England believed it would peak by the end of this year.\nIncome growth is at 2.1%.\nThe incomes squeeze which returned last month has just become tighter.\nThere is some evidence it is having an effect, although consumers have so far been remarkably resilient in the face of rising prices.\nThe latest Visa data on credit and debit card activity earlier this week suggested the first fall in consumer spending in four years.\nThe retail sales figures published on Thursday by the Office for National Statistics will be closely watched.\nLast month's saw the biggest quarterly fall in seven years, although the figures can be volatile.\nBehind all this data are the real stories of people who are worse off.\nAverage wage growth masks wide variations, of course.\nThose in the public sector have seen their pay either frozen - or rises capped at 1% - since 2010.\nAnd those people who receive in-work benefits to top up their income have not seen those payments rise.\nIt is into this toxic mix that the question of austerity is thrown - public sector pay and benefits freezes are controlled by the government.\nYes, Theresa May can argue that government debts are still rising and that those debts will have to be paid off by future generations.\nThe need for \"sound money\" still holds sway among many.\nBut, if people feel worse off they tend to look to politicians for solutions.\nAnd if there aren't any, they tend to punish incumbents.\nSince the Second World War there have only been three elections where real incomes have been falling - 1945, 2010 and 2017.\nNone of them ended well for the governing party going into the election - even if they had just won a world war.\nNick Timothy, Theresa May's former chief of staff who resigned at the weekend, said voters \"were tired of austerity\".\nToday's inflation figure will only make that exhaustion - and pressure on the government to change tack - more acute.",

        "question": "The problem could turn off the engine in affected vehicles while they were being driven, disabling the airbags.\nThe carmaker announced the recall last month, but it has admitted employees knew about the defect as early as 2004.\nThe issue has been linked to 13 deaths and GM has also launched an internal investigation into the matter.\nMeanwhile, a recent report by the New York Times claimed that the US safety regulator had received more than 260 complaints over the past 11 years about GM vehicles that \"suddenly turned off while being driven\".\n\"But they declined to investigate the problem,\" the report alleged.\nThe US House Energy and Commerce Committee said that it is also investigating the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration's (NHTSA) response to consumer complaints related to the problem.\nFred Upton, chairman of the committee, said: \"Did the company or regulators miss something that could have flagged these problems sooner?\"\nHe added: \"We plan to seek detailed information from both NHTSA and GM and will hold a hearing in the coming weeks.\"\nThe recall covers six models: the 2005-07 Chevrolet Cobalt, 2006-07 Chevrolet HHR, 2007 Pontiac G5, 2006-07 Pontiac Solstice, 2003-07 Saturn Ion, and 2007 Saturn Sky.\nRecalls are not uncommon in the industry.\nHowever, the issue is being linked to deaths and General Motors' admission that employees knew about the defect for many years may prove tricky for the company.\nThe NHTSA has already demanded detailed information from GM about when it knew of the problem and how it handled it.\nThe carmaker could face fines if the regulators rule that it took too long to report safety issues.\nThe company also faces recall and repair costs as well as potential liability claims.\nOn Monday, the company said it had hired Anton Valukas, the Chicago-based lawyer who led the court-ordered investigation of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, to lead its internal inquiry into the matter.\nGM spokesman Selim Bingol said Mr Valukas \"has been charged to go where the facts take him and give the company an unvarnished report on what happened\".\nThe recall and the related investigations are the first major challenge for the new chief executive, Mary Barra.\nIt also comes as GM reported a 22% drop in profits for 2013, hurt by disappointing performance outside North America.\nGM made a net profit of $3.77bn (\u00c2\u00a32.31bn) for the last financial year, down from $4.86bn (\u00c2\u00a32.98bn) recorded in 2012.",

        "question": "The Human Rights Committee said so-called bulk data gathering was \"capable of being justified\".\nIt welcomed the Investigatory Powers Bill as a \"significant step forward\" in human rights terms but said more safeguards were needed.\nThe Home Office said it welcomed the joint committee's report.\nThe Investigatory Powers Bill aims to put on a firmer legal footing the collection by the security services of vast quantities of internet data in the UK and personal details held on databases.\nHome Secretary Theresa May says these so-called bulk powers have played a significant role in every major counter-terrorism investigation over the past decade.\nBut civil liberties groups have raised concerns about privacy.\nThe government has already had to significantly amend its proposals after a draft bill last year was heavily criticised by three parliamentary committees.\nThe legislation returns to the Commons on Monday for further scrutiny, and the government wants it to become law by the end of year.\nAhead of the debate, the joint committee said in a report that bulk powers were not \"inherently incompatible with the right to respect for private life\", saying it was \"capable of being justified if they have a sufficiently clear legal basis, are shown to be necessary, and are proportionate\".\nBut it said the operational case for using the power should be assessed by the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, who should report back to Parliament.\nOn the human rights implications of the bill, the committee welcomed steps towards providing \"a clear and transparent legal basis\" for the investigatory powers being used by security and intelligence agencies.\nBut it said improvements could be made \"to enhance further the compatibility of the legal framework with human rights\".\nThe MPs and peers also raised concerns that the wording of clauses concerning the subject matter of targeted interception and equipment interference warrants was \"too broadly drafted\" and suggested it should be tightened to prevent \"large numbers of people\" potentially falling within its scope.\nAnd it said major alterations to warrants should not take place without approval by a judicial commissioner.\n\"In our view, the power to make major modifications to warrants for targeted interception, without judicial approvals, is so wide as to give rise to real concern that the requirement of judicial authorisation can be circumvented, thereby undermining that important safeguard against arbitrariness,\" it said.\nThe committee also questioned the robustness of new safeguards for legally privileged communications and called for extra safeguards in relation to MPs' communications and journalists' sources.\nCommittee chairman Labour's Harriet Harman said: \"Protection for MP communications from unjustified interference is vital, as it is for confidential communications between lawyers and clients.\n\"And for journalists' sources, the bill must provide tougher safeguards to ensure that the government cannot abuse its powers to undermine parliament's ability to hold the government to account.\"\nWelcoming the committee's report, a Home Office spokesman said the government has \"encouraged rigorous scrutiny of the bill\".\nShe said the draft bill was scrutinised by three parliamentary committees \"and we have listened closely to detailed and productive points made during Commons committee stage\".\n\"It is right that any further detailed discussion and debate should be on the floor of the House at report stage,\" she added.",

        "question": "The Republican presidential frontrunner claimed that research by the respected Pew organisation showed a \"great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population\" - but he did not refer to any specific study to support that claim, and we can't find one that does.\nMr Trump did cite a specific a study by the Center for Security Policy - \"very highly respected people, who I know, actually\" - which he said showed that 25% of Muslims in the US believed violence against America was justified \"as part of the global jihad\".\nMr Trump's press release:\nBut what exactly is the Center for Security Policy, and just how highly respected is it?\nThe CSP was founded in 1988 by Frank Gaffney Jr, a former staffer in the Ronald Reagan administration who has been accused of Islamophobia. On its website, the centre calls itself a \"Special Forces in the War of Ideas\" which offers \"maximum bang for the buck\" to its donors.\nThe CSP does not publish information about who those donors are, but according to a 2013 report by Salon they include some of the US's biggest aviation and defence companies - Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and General Electric.\nPromoted on the organisation's website are reports and books with titles such as Star Spangled Sharia, Civilisation Jihad, and Muslim Colonisation of America. Responding to the controversy over Mr Trump's remarks, the CSP said it was \"necessary to respond to the threat posed by jihadist terror in a way that ... calls it what it is\".\nThe CSP has been criticised across the political spectrum - by high-profile Republicans as well as Democrats - and by organisations which monitor extremist groups. Terri Johnson, executive director of the Center for New Community and J Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, called it \"an extremist think-tank\" led by an \"anti-Muslim conspiracist\".\nThe group was heavily criticised in 2012 after it repeatedly accused Huma Abedin, an aide to Hillary Clinton, of being a secret member of the Muslim Brotherhood. Leading Republicans including John McCain and John Boehner denounced the accusations.\nThe CSP has been criticised by a wide range of extremism monitoring organisations, including the  Anti-Defamation League, and Center for Democratic Values at City University of New York.\nArguably, no. According to the Bridge Initiative, a Georgetown University Islamophobia research project, the CSP survey was an online, self-selecting poll of 600 people, meaning respondents opted in to taking part.\nSelf-selecting internet surveys are less reliable that more traditional, random polling methods, because the opt-in element can lead to bias. Then there are the existing views of the organisation commissioning the poll - the CSP - which may have influenced the outcome.\nThe Washington Post called the poll \"shoddy\". According to the Post, the question had an agree/disagree answer format with agree in each case linked to the more controversial option - favouring Sharia law or supporting violence. Researchers say this format is affected by \"acquiescence response bias\" - we are generally more likely to favour agree options.\nThe CSP said in a statement on Sunday that its research methods were \"consistent with international industry standards\".\nMr Gaffney Jr served in the Reagan administration during the 1980s but left in 1988 to form the CSP, after his nomination as assistant secretary of defence was rejected by the Senate.\n\"Once a respectable Washington insider,\" according to the Southern Poverty Law Centre, which monitors US hate groups and extremists, Mr Gaffney Jr became \"one of America's most notorious Islamophobes\", the SPLC said.\nMr Gaffney Jr has repeatedly accused parts of America's Muslim population of what he calls \"civilisational jihad\". He has also called for Muslims to be investigated by a \"new and improved\" House Un-American Activities Committee - a highly controversial Cold War-era body which questioned and blacklisted US citizens accused of being communists.",

        "question": "An apparent link between alcohol abuse and suicidal behaviour was also identified.\nIn all, three studies into the suicide and alcohol abuse were commissioned by the Public Health Agency.\nKey findings on suicide showed rates were higher in Belfast and other larger towns and cities.\nAlmost half of those who take their own lives in Northern Ireland have made a previous attempt or have had a history of suicidal thoughts, the research suggests.\nWhen it comes to alcohol abuse, families often felt a stigma when trying to get help and GPs said time and a lack of coordination led to problems accessing services.\nA study carried out over 10 years from 2001, involving 1,000 children and 1,097 parents, found that one in five parents were \"problem drinkers\".\nThose families experienced more separations and divorces. Their children were found to spend more time outside the home and felt less attachment to school.\nThe report also showed that children developed clear strategies to help them cope with their parents' drinking.\nIt stresses that schools and teachers should be more aware of these problems.\nThe three research studies were carried out by teams at the University of Ulster and Queen's University, Belfast.\nChief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said it was \"vitally important\" that policy makers listened carefully to the messages in the research studies.\n\"Doing so will ensure that future service delivery improves the care of people impacted by either of these devastating problems,\" he said.\n\"More importantly, we must all ensure we work together towards eliminating these problems from society altogether.\"\nDr Janice Bailie from the PHA said: \"The research we are publishing today is testament to the commitment in Northern Ireland of individuals and organisations trying to understand more about these emotive and important issues.\n\"For anyone who has been affected by the suicide of a loved one or by the misuse of alcohol we hope that today's conference reinforces the message that we are all committed to tackling these issues and in ensuring that all the invaluable information being gathered is available and being used to translate into visible and beneficial actions.\"",
